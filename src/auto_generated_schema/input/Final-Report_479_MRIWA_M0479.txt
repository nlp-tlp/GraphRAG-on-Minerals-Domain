 Executive Summary 
Scope  
In 2017, Murdoch University started a research project funded by the Minerals Research Institute of Western 
Australia (MRIWA) and the industry partner s Lithium Australia NL and Venus Metals Ltd.  The project was aimed 
at determining the effect of process parameters on the  separation of impurities from acidic leach liquor  from the 
SiLeachTM process , and production of  a purified lithium solution .  The project  also investigate d opportunities for 
the recovery of lithium as lithium hydroxide and production of potential valuable by-products.  As part of the 
planned work, at the start of the project a literature review was undertaken to gather information available on 
current processing options  for lithium from different sources  and other relevant data.  The experimental program 
of the study was  divided into two phases.  Phase 1 focused on the development of an impurity separation process 
and establish ed the effect of key process parameters (type of acid neutralisation reagent , pH, seeding, and redox 
potential ) on the precipitation of the impurit ies and their in fluence on lithium deportment. This phase also 
included a detailed characterisation of the solid compounds formed in the precipitation and an evaluation of the 
relative adsorption o f lithium on to the identified compounds in order to determine to what extent each  may be 
contributing to loss  of lithium during the purification process .  Phase 2 focused  on the production of potentially 
valuable by-products and lithium production as lithium hydroxide  from the  purified  leach liquor,  along with 
investigating the potential options for recovery of important  reagents  for recycle , such as fluoride and acid. The 
residue from each impurity separation stage was also examined to determine if it could be produced as, o r 
converted into, a marketable by -product.  
The Phase 1 work was extended to include assessment of the effect of temperature on the deportment of all 
elements , as it was identified using thermo chemical modelling that temperature has a significant effect on lithium 
losses from solution .  Likewi se, in Phase 2 , a few potentially important by -products that could be produced  were 
identified  that warrant ed greater attention than some of the scheduled work in Phase 2.  Therefore, sighter 
testwork on solvent extraction options that was originally prop osed for Phase 2 was replaced with additional work 
on the recovery of by-products .   
The testwork results have shown that major impurit y elements  present in the leach solution were aluminium, 
potassium , sodium, fluoride, manganese, magnesium, calcium and iron , and a 3 -stage impurity separation process 
was used to remove these impurities .  Calcite (CaCO 3) was found to be effective  in neutralis ing the acidic leach 
liquor to pH 1 -1.5 (Stage 1) , with  hydrated lime (Ca(OH) 2) used to sequentially increase the pH to 4-6 (Stage 2)  and 
to 11-12 (Stage 3) . The invest igation comprised both experimental and computer modelling work using bench 
scale tests and desktop evaluation using a thermochemical software (HSC Chemistry) to understand the process chemistry and deter mine the effects of the studied  process parameters.   Analytical techniques used were  XRD, 
SEM , and EDX  for solid samples and solution samples  were analysed using ICP -MS. 
Main Findings  
Phase 1 
Stage 1 neutralisation  
• A calcite dosage of 243 kg/m3 was need ed to raise pH to 1 in 4 hours at  any temperature  in the range 
25-80 °C, with or without seed ing; 
 
MRIWA Solution Purification and By -Product Formation – Final Report  Page iv 
 • The kinetic precipitation tests showed that a temperature > 50 °C was needed to minimise lithium and 
rubidium ( ~ 5%) losses with calcite ; 
• Silica and magnesium precipitation  were greater at temperature s < 50 °C while iron precipitation was  
greater at 80 °C; 
• Seeding promoted the precipitation of all species  at all temperatures ; and  
• Gypsum was the major and only crystalline phase identified in the precipitate.  
Stage 2 neutralisation  
• A hydrated lime dosage of 80 kg/m3 was need ed to raise  the pH to 5-6 in 6 hours at any temperature in 
the range 25 -80 °C, with or without seeding; 
• This stage showed the greatest losses of lithium (15 -23%), rubidium (9 -67%) and caesium (56 -94%) to 
the precipitate ; 
• Seeding showed little effect at 8 0 °C but did promote precipitation at 25  °C; 
• Lowering the temperature reduce d the rubidium, caesium and fluoride precipitation; and 
• Gypsum was aga in the main crystalline phase identified in the precipitate  but third  stage is where most 
of the aluminium, fluoride and silica were  also precipitated .  A new  fluoride species ( not predicted by 
HSC software) was identified, which was associated with the hydrated aluminium  (AlF 3-x(OH) x∙nH 2O). 
Stage 3 neutralisation  
• A hydrated lime dosage of 26 kg/m3 was needed to raise pH to 13 in 6 hours regardless of the  
temperature or if seeded or not ; 
• Minimal lithium (1 -10%), rubidium (1 -6%) or caesium (0.1 -0.3%) was lost to the precipitate at 80 °C but 
the loss increased at  25 °C; 
• Seeding had no significant effect ; and 
• Manganese hydroxide was identified in the precipitate, along with c alcium hydroxide which indicate d 
that not all the added Ca(OH) 2 reacted.  
Oxidation or r eduction  
• Addition of peroxide (H 2O2) or sulphite (SO 32-) show ed a very little effect . There was a  slightly higher 
lithium loss  but neither will assist in the neutralisation stage.  
Filtration  
• The higher the temperature the faster the filtration rate;  
• There was no comparable difference between the seeded and unseeded tests; and  
• The filtration rate for stage 1 with CaCO 3 was the fastest followed by stage 2 with Ca(OH) 2 then stage 3 
with Ca(OH) 2. 
Li absorption  
• Apart from gypsum, t he two main precipitates  in Stage 2, gibbsite (Al(OH) 3) and alunite ( KAl 3(SO 4)2(OH) 6) 
absorbed  ~ 50% of the lithium from a synthetic solution ; 
• The other prec ipitates absorbed < 2 0% lithium ; and 
• Testing on  real solutions confirmed that in stage 2 filtrate (pH  ~ 5), gibbsite and alunite are the main 
absorbers of lithium from solution.

Phase 2 
IX adsorption  
• The strong anion exchange resin (Ambersep 920U) was  used to recover the metal ions while a weak 
cationic exchange resin (Lewatit CNP80)  was used to recover the potassium and sodium ; 
• Testing confirmed that metal ions can  be recovered  from solution, but the extent of adsorption was 
limited as they  form ed both  anionic and cationic complexes in solution ; 
• The bonding was weak and the adsorbed ions were easily displaced with a water wash ; and 
• The results of the weak cationic exchange resin (Lewatit CNP80)  confirm ed the resin will load K, Rb, Cs , 
and Na over  lithium . 
Electrodialysis 
• Preliminary tests have confirmed that acid is generated in the anode compartment,  and lithium 
hydroxide  is generated  in the cathode  compartment ;  
• Sulfuric acid produced can be potentially recycled back into the process flowsheet; and   
• The h igh resistance of the solution tested resulted in the solution heating up.  
By-product p roduction  
Sodium silicate by -product from leach residue  
• The production of sodium silicate from the SiLeachTM residue s was possible at the less aggressive 
atmospheric conditions (100  °C).  However, the conv ersion and extraction was low ( ~ 50 %); 
• It was also determined that  dr ied residue  was more reactive than the wet residue,  and also dissolved 
fewer impurities ; and 
• At Na:Si mol ratio s of less than 0.4 for the dry residue and less than 0.8 for the wet residue,  very little 
silicon dissolved (<  1%).  
Size analysis of  leach residue  
• In the coarsest fraction (+46.8 μm)  mainly gypsum and fluorite was identified by XRD while the finer 
fractions indicated unreacted phyllosilicates;  
• SEM confirmed the results showing platy mica in the finer size fractions while gypsum and fluorite were 
identified in the coarsest fraction;  
• This suggests the residual fluorite could be recovered by a size -based separation ; and 
• Size by size assay confirm ed the concentration of fluorite in this fraction but  this fraction only contained 
10% of the total fluoride in the sample . 
By-p roducts from precipitates  
• Sizing showed stage 1 and 2 precipitates were very fine;  
• Size by assaying showed the elements were evenly distributed throughout the size fractions so sizing could not be  used to separate a particular precipitate from the bulk precipitate s; and 
• Magnetic separation and flotation c ould not be used to separate a particular precipitate from the bulk 
precipitates .

Alunite  Process  
• The production of alunite from the lepidolite leach liquor w as  investigated where varying stoichiometric 
amounts of potassium sulphate w ere added to the solution;  
• A precipitate was observed at  80% and 100% stoichiometry but when washed with water the prec ipitate 
dissolved;  
• The predicted residue composition from wash solution shows that the  alunite will absorb fluoride, 
calcium and caesium;  
• Further testing showed ~30% of the fluoride will be recovered in the alunite precipitate along with 
caesium;  
• This method reduced the lithium and rubidium loss by 50% over the traditional three stages of 
neutralisation. 
 
Recommendations 
Effect on neutralisation  chemical  
• Calcite should  be used to neutralise the liquor to pH 1 - 1.5 followed by solid/liquid separation to  
remove most of the gypsum as  clean by -product;  
• A temperature of 80 °C is recommended for stage 1 but a lower temperature of 50 °C should be 
considered for stages 2 and 3;  
• Addition of peroxide or sulphite is not recommended; and  
• Seeding is only recommended  for stage 1 . 
Absorption  
• Gibbsite and alunite are  the main precipitate s that contribute  to the lithium loss  from solution , where 
alunite would also absorb all the other key elements from solutions ;  
• Further work  to minimise alunite forming should be investigated through the use of ion exchange resins 
to remove potassium from solution . 
Sodium silicate production  
• Further understanding of what form of silica is being dissolved (amorphous or crystalline) to explain t he 
poor dissolution;  
• Further work at different temperatures and feed variability is required to assess the effects of these 
process parameters on the cost and utility of the process; and 
• Other uses for the amorphous silica in the final residue , such as in silica fertilisers,  should be 
investigated . 
Ion exchange purification  
• Further elution testing needs to be investigated to determine if selective elution can be achieved ; and  
• Further equilibrium loadings on synthetic solutions should provide the maximum loading of each 
element achievable with that resin . 
 
MRIWA Solution Purification and By -Product Formation – Final Report  Page vii 
  
Alunite production  
• Further tests are needed to confirm if an alunite/fluoride precipitate will produce a residue suitable  for 
recycling back to leaching; and  
• Further tests are needed to confirm if lower lithium losses are observed by using this process.  
Electro -dialysis  
• Further tests are  needed to test different membranes;  
• Method s for reducing the solution resistance  need further investigation ; and  
• Testing on real solutions is needed.

 1 Background  
Lithium Australia (LIT) is investigating the production of lithium  chemicals  from lithium micas, particularly 
lepidolite, by a novel hydrometallurgical process  called SiL eachTM which  eliminates the baking stage in the 
traditional processing route.  In the SiLeachTM process, the lepidolite ore or concentrate is treated directly with 
sulphuric acid and calcium fluoride , extracting  95% or more of the lithium  contained in the feed .  The acid in the 
liquor is then neutralised and the impurities  removed prior to recovery  of the lithium as carbonate or h ydroxide.  
This study reports on the neutralisation of the acidic lepidolite leach liquor over three stages : (i) using calcite 
(CaCO 3) to pH 1 .0-1.5; (ii) hydrated lime (Ca(OH) 2) to pH 5 -6; and (iii) (Ca(OH) 2) to pH 11-13 .  The neutralisations 
at each stage  were  conducted at 25, 50 and 90  °C.  The effect of seeding at a concentration of 50 g/L (stages 1 & 
2) and 25 g/L (stage 3) was also investigated.  A study of the absorption of lithium with known precipitates that 
form during these stages has also been undertaken.  
Ion exchange ( IX) purification, sodium silicate  production, by -product purification and final lithium carbonate and 
oxide productions were also completed.  The following report presents the major findings  on MRIWA Project M479 
“Solution Purific ation and By -Product Production ”.  Only appropriate information has been reported and discussed 
in the report with all data presented in the appendices.  
2 Aims and Objectives  
The main aim of this study was to investigate the best condition s for neutralising the highly acidic lepidolite leach 
solution so as to remove all the impurities from the solution ( i.e. excess acid, iron, aluminium, silica and fluoride ), 
while minimising lithium losses prior to the final purification of the solution and recovery of lithium by 
precipitation at pH 10 or above.   In addition, the formation of possible by -products during this process and from 
the residue was also investigated.  
The major o bjectives  were  to: 
• Investigate the use of limestone (or calcite) for stage 1  and hydrated lime for stage 2 and 3 as 
neutralising agents ; 
• Report the reagent usage and precipitation of all major impurities  at each  stage;  
• Determine the changes in the precipitation profiles with temperature ; 
• Determine the effect of seeding at each stag e at different temperatures;  
• Identify what species absorb lithium and how to minimising the co -precipitation of lithium with the se 
precipitat es; 
• Determine if it is possible to produce any by -products from these precipitates;  
• Determine if it is possible to recover the fluoride;  
• Investigate IX resins for removal of final contaminan ts at pH 12-13; 
• Investigate the p roduc tion of  final Li, Cs and Rb products ; and 
• Determine the feasibility of producing sodium silicate  from the leach residue  by leaching with caustic 
soda at 100  °C.

Samples of the neutralisation agents (calcite and hydrated lime) used in the testwork were sized using a Laser 
Sizer.  The data showing the cumulative passing size generated from two runs of each sample are presented in Figure 4
.  The calcite was a fine powder with a P 80 of 7 μm, while the hydrated lime had a larger particle size with 
a P 80 of 50  μm.

3.2 Testwork methods  
The neutralisation testwork was investigated at 25, 50 and 80 °C following the procedure s summarised below .  
The detailed  procedure s are provided  in the Appendices.  
3.2.1  Batch neutralisation  
To ensure all reactions are complete  tests were run for 24 hours before termination.  In this case, every point in 
the pH vs. reagent dosage curve was derived using a separate test. The batch precipitation test s were performed 
by setting up individual  fixed volume ( 20 mL) of solution in to which different single doses of neutralisation reagent  
were added . Calcite was used to target pH 1  and hydrated lime to target pH 5 -6 and pH 10 -12. Following the 
reagent addition, the mixtures  were  stoppered to minimise evaporation,  and left to react for 24 hours  at the set 
temperature in a thermostatic ally controlled water bath  (Figure 5). This procedure was performed on all feed 
solutions  to determine the required dosage to achieve the target pH  for each stage .  This was conducted  at 80 °C.  
The calcite (CaCO 3) and hydrated lime (Ca(OH) 2) were  added as a slurry at 25% solids density .

3.2.2  Bulk neutralisation  
Bulk tests were used to generate sufficient solution at the desired pH for all required tests  for subsequent  stage s.  
It involved a fixed volume of solution being contacted with a fixed amount of calcite  to achieve a desired pH  1 and 
left to react for 24 hours at 80 °C in a stirred reactor ( Figure 6).  On completion of that stage, the slurry was filte red 
and some of filtrate was treated with hydrated lime  to achieve a higher target pH  (5-6) and left again to react for 
further 24 hours at 80 ° C. This was repeated for stage 3 hydrated lime. The calcite (CaCO 3) and hydrated lime 
(Ca(OH) 2) were  again added as a slurry at 25% solids density .

3.2.3  Batch kinetic neutralisation  
The batch kinetic precipitation test s were performed by setting up individual  fixed volume (20 mL) of solution in to 
which fixed single doses of neutralisation reagent  were added  to achieve the desired end pH .  Calcite was used to 
target pH 1 , hydrated lime to target pH 5 -6 or pH 10 -12.  Following the reagent addition, the containers were 
 
MRIWA Solution Purification and By -Product Formation – Final Report  Page 7 
 stoppered and the mixtures  were  left to react for 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6 & 24 hours  at the set temperature (25, 50 or 80 
°C) in a thermostatic ally controlled  water bath  (Figure 5).  At each specified time an individual test was terminated.   
For the seeded test, precipitate from the bulk tests was added to each respective stage at a solids concentration 
of 50 g/L for stages 1 & 2 but was reduced to 25 g/L to reflect the lower precipitate mass for stage 3 .  On completion 
they were filtered and the residue re -pulpe d and filtered before being dried , digested and analysed.  
3.2.4  Adsorption study  
To assess the effect of known precipitates ( Table 4) on lithium absorption a series of test s were conducted where 
1 g/L Li solution s were at pH 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 12  and contacted with 1 g of each precipitate for 24 hours at 80  °C.  
Each container was stoppered and continually mixed in a thermostatic ally controlled  water bath ( Figure 5). On 
completion , the pulp s were filtered and residue re -pulped and filtered before being dried , digested and analysed.   
All precipitates were synthesised with the exception of fluorite which was a mineral sample.  Similar tests were 
conducted on real filtrate solution from stage 2 where 20  mL of the filtrate was contacted with 1 g of some of the 
precipitates  (gypsum, gibbsite,  alunite and fluorite) .

3.2.5  Sodium silicate production  
Tests were conducted on two forms of the SiLeachTM leach residue:  
1. Dry feed – i.e., dried leach residue (supplied by Nagrom, WA) and  
2. Wet feed – i.e., leach residue still in wet form (supplied by ANSTO, NSW).  
The two feed materials used are shown in Figure 7. 
 
Figure 7.  Samples supplied for sodium silicate testing . 
 
MRIWA Solution Purification and By -Product Formation – Final Report  Page 8 
 The effect of reagent dosage was examined for Na:Si molar ratio s from 0.2 to 2.6 and two kinetic tests (one on 
each feed ) at Na:Si molar ratio s of 2.6 over 24 hours wit h intermittent sampling at 1, 5, 8 and 24 hours.  A series 
of tests were setup where the solids were placed in a reactor in contact with 5 M (200 g/L) sodium hydroxide 
solution at the correct Na:Si molar ratio at 100  °C and left to leach for the required t ime.  The residue was then 
filtered, immediately re -pulped, r efiltered and dried overnight. Samples of the solid and liquor phases (filtrate and 
wash)  produced in each test were subsequently assayed and the solids characterised by Scanning Electron 
Microscopy ( SEM ) and Energy Dispersive X -ray spectroscopy (EDX). 
3.2.6  IX resin purification  study  
A number of different types of ion exchange (IX) resins  (Table 5) were investigated wh ere 5  mL of each resin was 
contacted with 20 mL of pH 12 solution  for 24 hours at 25  °C (exception s were the two weak acid cationic resin s 
where 40  mL were used due to their double  exchange capacity).  Each container was stoppered and continual ly 
mixed in a thermostatically controlled  water bath ( Figure 5).  On completion they were filtered and the filtrate 
analysed.  To prevent any change to pH the form of  the resins were converted to the sodium (Na+) form of the 
resin .

3.2.6.1  Column l oading  
Two resins were chosen for purifying the final filtrate a strong base anion exchange resin (Ambersep 920U) to 
remove anionic metal species and weak acid cation exchange r esin ( Lewatit CNP80) to remove  potassium  and 
sodium .  The filtrate was passed through the column of resin at a rate of 5 mL/min and 20  mL sample collected 
for dilution and analysis.  80 mL of each resin was used in the preliminary testing but was reduced to 20 mL in the 
later experiments to facilitate breakthrough .  Once loaded the column was washed with 150 mL of deionised water 
before being eluted with 500  mL of 1  M sodium nitrate or sulphuric acid at 5mL/min for the strong anionic and 
weak cationic resins , respectively.  Once again , the  20 mL solution samples  were collected for dilution and analysis.  
Before using the weak cationic exchange resin the form of the resin was converted to lithium by passing 500 mL 
of 1M LiOH.  Figure 8 shows the instrument setup.

3.2.6.2  Equilibrium loading  
The resin equilibrium loading experiments were conducted b y contacting varying amounts of resin with a fix 
volume of solution for 24 hours at ro om temperature  (~ 20 °C) .  The resin was removed and the filtrate analysed 
to determine the amount each species loaded onto the resin.  
3.2.7  Final precipitate  recovery  
The filt rate from stage 3 were used to produce lithium carbonate and rubidium and caesium double sulphate 
products by first  investigating sodium carbonate then  carbon dioxide over a period of 1-24 hours at room 
temperature (~  20 °C).  Sodium and aluminium was then added to precipitate the rubidium and caesium.  Cooling 
the solution to <5 °C was also investigated to recover the potassium as sulphate  precipitate.  On completion the 
residues and  filtrate s were analysed to mass balance the separations . 
3.2.8  Electro -dialysis  
To validate the production process  of lithium hydroxide,  a synthetic solution  of lithium sulphate  was treated in an 
electrolytic setup  assisted by membrane separation to recover lithium as lithium hydroxide .  Figure 9 and Figure 
10 respectively show the schematic and photograph of the  3-chambers electro -dialysis  setup .  Solution in each 
chamber was adequately agitated and cell temperature maintained during the test .

3.2.9  Solution s 
All feed solutions and filtrate samples were diluted and analysed for Li, Na, Mg, Mn, Al, Si, K, Ca, Fe,  Rb, and Cs  
using a Thermo Scientific ICP -MS instrument, model iCAP -Q ICP-MS at Murdoch University.   Fluoride analyses  were 
performed with a fluoride ion -selective electrode  model ORION 9609BNWF from Thermo Scientific  after  addition 
of TISAB II buffer solution  and CDTA complexing agent.  
3.2.10  Solids  
Solids were assayed by dissolving ~  1 g ( weighed to the nearest 0.0001 g ) in 50 mL aqua regia and boiling for 30 
minutes .  The resulting solutions were filtered, diluted and analyse d by the methods described in the appendices . 
3.2.11  Mineralogical analyse s 
Selected solid samples were analysed using X -ray diffraction (XRD) to determine  their mineralogical composition 
and mineral associations.  All XRD analyses were performed in house  with a GBC Enhanced Multi -material Analyser 
(EMMA).  The X -ray tube was operated at a voltage of 35.0 kV and current of 28.0 mA with copper Kα x- rays (λ = 
0.1540562  nm).   Diffraction patterns were collected over a range of 10° ≤ 2θ ≤ 6 0° using a 1° diverging slit, a 0.2° 
receiving slit and a 1° scattering slit.  A step size of 0.02° was used  at a rate of 2°/min ( 0.6 s per step).  
3.2.12  Scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy  
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses  were performed with a JEOL JCM -6000 Bench top SEM with an 
energy dispersive X -ray spectroscopy (EDX) analyser.  An accelerating voltage of 15 kV  was used to produce the 
SEM images of the precipitates.  All images were taken with  backscattered electrons (BSE)  unless otherwise 
specified .  Elements lighter than beryllium cannot be detected by EDX, so it is not possible to verify the presence 
of lithium or hydrogen in these precipitates.  Three residues from the calcite neutralisation tests and three from 
the hydrated lime neutralisation tests were mounted in resin, polished with silicon carbide paper, carbon coated and examined by SEM.  Approximately 15 EDX spectra were taken of each residue.  A 15 kV accelerating voltage was used for the semi -quantitative EDX analyses.  All EDX analyses were run for 30 s econds .  Several false -colour 
element maps were taken  with a resolution of 384 × 512 pixels and a c ounting time of 10 × 0.2 m illiseconds  per 
pixel.  The assignment of elements and colours varied, and are specified below each image.  EDX is only a semi-quantitative technique, and th e peak height is a function of electron beam energy and relative concentr ation.

 4 Results and D iscussion  
4.1 Thermodynamic modelling  
The chemical thermodynamic modelling software ( HSC Chemistry v 7.1.1 ) was used to predict the results of the 
precipitation experiments at varied doses of calcite or hydrated lime.  Using the software, it was possible to test a 
much greater number of dosages over smaller increments than practical in the laboratory.  Results  of this work 
are summarised below.  
4.1.1  Reagent dosage vs. deportment of key elements  
The initial composition of the solution used in thes e calculations was based on the analysis of the composite leach 
solution.  The accuracy of iron results is uncertain as the ferrous to ferric ratio in the leach liquor is unknown.  For 
the purposes of these calculations, both forms of iron were assumed to be in equal concentration.  The hydrated lime dosage was increased from 0 to 400 kg/m
3 in increments of 4 kg/m3.  Two temperatures were used, 80  and 
25 °C.  The calculated speciation was used to determine the percentage of each element present in the solid  phase.  
 
Figure 11.  Predicted extent of precipitation  vs. hydrated lime  addition  at 80 °C (right) and 25  °C (left).  
The elements most affected by temperature were rubidium and silicon.  When the temperature is lower, silica is more readily remobilised as H
2SiO 42- and SiO 44- ions at high  pH values .  The effect of lime dosage on pH was quite 
similar at 25 and 80  °C up to pH 10 before they diverge d significantly (Figure 12).

will neutralise the same amount of acid as 1.00 g of CaCO 3.

 A plot of  the deportment of key elements as a function of pH shows that there is minimal difference between the 
expected results at 25 and 80  °C with t he exception of  rubidium ( Figure 13). Since rubidium is a potentially valuable 
by-product, it is important to minimise the  loss of rubidium during the removal of unwanted iron and aluminium . 
 
Figure 13. Predicted extent of precipitation vs. pH  at 80 °C ( solid lines ) and 25  °C (dashed lines ). 
Rubidium is recovered as the double sulphate salt rubidium alum, RbAl(SO 4)2∙12H 2O which is less soluble at 25  °C 
(Figure 14).  Calculations indicate that the solubility of rubidium alum is 12 times higher at 80  °C than at 25  °C.  
Rubidium will re -dissolve once most of the aluminium has been removed as alunite or aluminium hydroxide .

 4.2 Batch neutralisation  
The pilot  leach solution was  used for this testwork.  Batch precipitation of the pilot leach  solution was undertaken 
to determine the required calcite  or hydrated lime addition  to achieve the desired target pH and to conduct the 
bulk and batch kinetic neutralis ation tests . The change in the solution composition at each calcite ( CaCO 3) or 
hydrated lime (Ca(OH) 2) addition and pH are  presented in Table 6 and  
Table 7.  The detailed data for this work are  presented in the Appendices.

Figure 15 & Figure 16 present the change in the amount of each element that p recipitated with filtrate pH and 
reagent addition.  It shows minimum lithium and rubidium loss es below  a calcite dosage of 250 kg/m3 or pH 1.5 
and likewise  with hydrate lime  below a calcit e dosage of 270 kg/m3 or pH 3.  Above these would result in losses o f 
between 20 -40% .  The majority (>  80%) of the iron, aluminium, calcium and silica were precipitated at pH 7.0 or 
dosage of 33 0 kg/m3 hydrated lime .

4.3 Bulk neutralisation  
To generate the required amount of solution for kinetic precipitation, IX purification and electo -dialysis  testing,  
bulk neutralisation tests were performed  over the duration of the testwork .  A summary of the  filtrate analyses of 
these separations are presented in Table 8. The final solution contain ed mainly lithium, sodium, potassium and 
rubidium with minor amounts of th e other species.   It should be n oted that  the concentration of lithium, rubidi um 
and caesium decreased during subsequent stages  due to dilution not losses from  precipitat ion.

4.4 Final precipitation  
The final solution and solids analy ses after neutralisation to pH 1.0 ,  pH 5 -6 and pH 10 -12 at 25  °C, 50  °C and 80 °C 
are summarised below. Neutralisation to pH 1 was achieved using calcite and hydrated lime was used to achieve 
pH 5-6 and pH 10-12.  
4.4.1  Stage 1 (Neutralisation with calcite)  
The final summary of the precipitation of the key  elements (Li, Al , Rb, Cs  and F) for stage 1 are presented in Table 
9 & Table 10.  Increasing the temperature from 25 to 80 °C increased the precipitate mass from 16  to 21%.  
Neutralising the solution at a higher temperature ( 80 °C) also inhibited the precipitat ion of aluminium but 
increased the amount of  caesium and fluoride  reporting to the  precipitate .  There was no trend with lithium and  
rubidium but between 5 -8% and 6 -10%, respectively was  lost to the precipitate  at precip itation temperatures >50 
°C.  Seeding tended to increase lithium and rubidium losses at lower temperatures, but decreased the losses at 80 
°C.

 4.4.2  Stage 2 (Neutralisation using hydrated lime)  
The final summary of the precipitati on of the key elements (Li, Al , Rb, Cs  and F) for stage 2 are presented in Table 
11 & Table 12.  Increasing the temperature from 25 to 80  °C increased the mass of precipitate from 13  to 18%.  
Seeding had little impact at 50 and 80  °C but did cause more of the species to precipitate at 25  °C.  This stage 
showed the greatest loss es of all species to the precipitate, meaning the alkali metals (Li, Rb, Cs) were probably 
co-precipitated with the aluminium and fluoride .

The final summary of the precipitati on of the key elements (Li, Al , Rb, Cs  and F) for stage 3 are presented in  Table 
13 & Table 14.  The temperature had little impact on the final residue mass but it appears  that increasing the 
temperature minimise s the precipitation of all species except for fluoride.  The lowest losses of alkali metals were 
at 80  °C in seeded slurries .

 4.5 Batch kinetic n eutralisation  
4.5.1  Stage 1 ( Neutralisation with  calcite ) 
The pilot  leach solution was neutralised to pH 1  with calcite  at a dosage of 243 kg/m3.  The change in filtrate 
chemical composition with time is summarised  in Table 15.  Figure 17 shows the extent of precipitation of the 
various elements analysed.  Lithium , rubidium and caesium  losses were low at all temperatures , around 5 -6%.  
Silica and magnesium precipitation was g reater at 25 °C  while iron and aluminium precipitation  was greater at 
higher temperature s (50 and 80 °C).

 The change in filtrate chemical composition with time for the seeded tests are summarised in Table 16 while Figure 
18 shows the extent of precipitation of the various elements analysed. When precipitate from the bulk 
precipitation  was added to initiate precipitation it caused lithium losses to increase from 5-6% (without seeding) 
to 5-14% with seeding.  Lithium losses were greatest at 25 °C but decreased to minimal levels at 80  °C.  The amount 
of magnesium and silica removed was  once again  greater at 25 °C compared to that at 50 and 80 °C . Overall, 4 
hours  was adequate for  the precipitation  process to complete at any  of the tested temperatures, and regardless 
of whether  or not the system was seeded.

4.5.2  Stag e 2 ( Neutralisation using hydrated lime ) 
The stage 1 solution was neutralised to pH 5 -6 with calcium hydroxide  at a dosage of 80 kg/m3.  The final filtrate 
results are presented in Table 17.  Figure 20 show s the extent of precipitation of the various elements analysed.   
Lithium losses w ere the greatest at this stage increas ing to 15 -22% .  Operating at lower temperature reduced the 
lithium, aluminium, rubidium,  caesium and  fluoride precipitation. Temperature had a minimal effect on the 
behaviour of fluoride in stage 1 but had a significant effect on fluoride precipitation  in stage 2 .  The data 
unequivocally shows that  the lithium was co -precipitated with these other elements.

The change in filtrate chemical composition with time for the seeded tests are summarised in Table 18 while Figure 
21 shows the extent of precipitation of the various elements analysed.  There was no obvious benefit of seedi ng 
at the higher temperature (8 0 °C) but it did promote precipitation of most species at 25  °C.  Higher temperatures 
decreased lithium, aluminium and fluoride precipitation, again demonstrating the co -precipitation of these 
elements .  Overall, the precipitation process require d 6 hours  to approach completion, no matter the temperature 
or whether  the system w as seeded or not.

 4.5.3  Stage 3 (Neutralisation using hydrated lime)  
The stage 2 solution was neutralised to pH 10 -12 with calcium hydroxide  at a dosage of 26 kg/m3.  The final filtrate 
results are presented in Table 19.  Figure 22 show s the extent of precipitation of the various elements analysed.  
The results showed minimal loss of Li, Cs  and Rb at high  temperatures (< 2%) with the precipitate contain ing mainly 
Ca, Mn  and Al with some Mg, Si and Fe .  Low temperature (25  °C) increased  the Li, Cs and Rb loss es.

 4.6 Effect of oxidation  
Two batch experiments was performed on stage 1 liquor to inves tigate what effect adding a reducing agent 
(sulphite, SO 32-) or an oxid ising agent (hydrogen peroxide, H 2O2) had on the deportment of elements.  The filtrate 
results of these tests are shown in Table 21.  There was no significant  difference  between the tests compared to 
no additive.

A single kinetic test was performed with the addition of H 2O2 and the elemental distribution is shown in Figure 24.  
When compared to the test without any addition there was slightly higher lithium and manganese precipitation, 
but the other elements were very similar  in behaviour .

4.7.1  Stage 1 prec ipitates formed on  neutralisation  with calcite  
4.7.1.1  Mineralogy of calcite precipitate  
Gypsum  (CaSO 4∙2H 2O) was the only crystalline phase identified in stage 1 when calcite was used as a neutralising 
agent (Figure 25).

Figure 25.  XRD results for precipitates formed in stage 1, with relevant reference data . 
4.7.1.2  SEM -EDX analyses of calcite precipitate  
No phases other than gypsum were identified with SEM ( Figure 26); similar to what was determined by XRD.  No 
elements other than Ca, S and O were detected.  Elements lighter than boron cannot be detected by EDX, so the 
presence of water can’t be identified by EDX.  The shapes of these particles matched  the typical shapes for gypsum 
crystals.

 4.7.2  Stage 2 & 3 precipitates formed with hydrated lime neutralisation  
4.7.2.1  Mineralogy of hydrated lime precipitate  
Gypsum was the main phase identified in stage 2 ( Figure 27).  Some calcium hydroxide was identified in stage 3 
which indicated inefficiency in utilisation.  An unkn own phase was also identified. This phase matched the 
diffraction pattern found in the literature (Rosenberg, 2006) for a hydrated aluminium fluoride, hereon labelled 
as AHF, with a general formula of AlF 3-x(OH) x.nH 2O (Figure 27).  Considering the strong effect that temperature 
had on the fluo rine deportment in stage 2, it is likely that the temperature influences the extent of fluoride 
substitution for hydroxide in AHF.   There was insufficient material for XRD analysis for stage 3 precipitates.

4.7.2.2  SEM -EDX examination of hydrated lime precipit ate  
EDX analyses of hydrated lime residues  at pH 5 (Stage 2) showed significant amounts of aluminium fluoride.  
Typically, aluminium  (red)  in the precipitate was associated with fluorine, while calcium  (blue)  was associated with 
sulphur  (green) ( Figure 28) i.e. gypsum and aluminium fluoride precipitates .

small amounts of manganese.

4.8 Calculation of crystal size  
Crystallite sizes for gypsum and alunite were calculated using the Scherrer equation based on the XRD peaks for 
those minerals.  Seeding resulted in larger gypsum  crystallites and faster increases in size when neutralising to pH 
1 with calcite and to pH 5 with calcium hydroxide ( Figure 32). 
 
MRIWA Solution Purification and By -Product Formation – Final Report  Page 30 
 The oxidised test sho wed a similar result to the standard neutralisation to pH 5.  There was little change in the 
crystallite sizing after 6 hours with all tests.  Alunite showed a different trend where there was very little difference 
between the seeded and unseeded neutralis ations ( Figure 33).  For the oxidised test there were larger crystallites 
after 4 -6 hours compared to the 24 hour test which  gave similar size to the o ther tests.  The rate of crystallite 
growth matched the rate of precipitation, indicating that no significant crystallisation occurred after precipitation 
ended around the 6 hour mark.

 4.9 Accountability  
Table 23, Table 24 & Table 25 summarise the accountabilities for all tests.  The tables present the average 
accountabilities over the batch testing and batch kinetic tests while individual time accountabilities are presented 
in the Appendices.  Apart from the very minor elements (Fe, Rb, Cs), and Ca where losses are due to gypsum re -
dissolution during precipitate washing, these accountabilities ( generally 100%  ± 20%) are considered to be 
acceptable for the scale and type of tests carried out, where errors can be cumulative.

4.10 Effect on Filtration  
Throughout the study , the time it took to filter the samples through a 22.9 cm2 funnel under vacuum was recorded.  
A summary of those times in relationship to the area and amount of solids are presented in Table 26.  Figure 34 
and Figure 35 illustrate these changes for unseeded and seeded , respectively.   In all cases , higher precipitation  
temperature resulted in  faster filtration rate s, while the solids density followed an opposite trend i.e. i ncreasing 
with the increase in temperature from 25 to 80 °C .   
In addition,  there was no significant  difference between t he filtration rate of seeded and unseeded  tests .  The 
filtration rate for stage 1 with CaCO 3 was the fastest  followed by stage 2 with Ca(OH) 2 then stage 3 with Ca(OH) 2.

 Precipitates formed in later stages were typically poorly crystalline, as determined by XRD.  This is a likely reason 
for the slower filtration rates observed for stage 2 and 3 precipitates.   That is the aluminium hydroxide species in 
stage 2 and the manga nese hydroxide in stage 3 is a ffecting the rate of filtration.  
4.11 Adsorption i nvestigation  
To determine which phases within  the precipitate d solids  were responsible for adsorbing or co -precipitating the 
lithium from solution , a range of synthetic precipitates  were  synthesised. E ach precipitate (1 g) was contacted 
with  a 1 g/L lithium solution at pH 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 12 for 24 hours at 80 °C.  The precipitate s were  chosen based 
on the solid phases  found in the  precipit ates in this study which include d gypsum, fluorite, goethite, pyrochroite , 
magnesi a, alunite and gibbsite .  The adsorption results over the pH range  are presented  in Figure 36. 
 
Figure 36.  Absorption of lithium by various known precipitates  at various pH . 
The results show minimal lithium adsorption on to pyrochroite (Mn(OH) 2) (<2%) and  fluorite  (CaF 2) (~ 5%), and 
slightly  higher adsorption onto gypsum  (CaSO 4∙2H 2O) (~ 15%), magnesia  (Mg(OH) 2) (~ 15% pH>7) and goethite  
(FeOOH) ( ~ 20% ). Between pH 3 and 6, up to 60% of the lithium in solution was absorbed onto alunite  
(KAl 3(SO 4)2(OH) 6) while gibbsite  (Al(OH) 3) adsorbed ~ 50%  of the lithium above pH 3 .  These results  indicate that  
lithium losses , which  were greatest in s tage 2  due to adsorption onto  alunite and /or gibbsite  that are formed 
during neutralisation . 
To test whether  these precipi tates cause d lithium losses  during the s tage 2 neutralisation, gypsum, fluorite , 
gibbsite and alunite were contacted with  stage 2 filtrate  (in duplicate) at 80 °C  for 24 hours.  The results of these 
separations  are presented in Figure 37.

Figu re 37.  Absorption of key elements  from s tage 2 filtrate  onto the four solids studied . 
It is clear that  gibbsite and alunite  indeed a dsorb s lithium from solution at pH 6.  Alunite appears to absorb all the 
elements in the solution.   Gibbsite absorbs lithium , aluminium  and fluoride , fluorite absorbs calcium, sodium, 
silica, aluminium and iron while  gypsum absorbs iron, calcium and fluoride.  
4.12 IX Investigation  
After pH modification to pH 12, the final filtrate still contains minor impurities  (Al, Si, Fe, Ca, Mn, K and F)  which 
could possibly be removed, or substantially reduced in concentration, by IX prior to precipitating out the lithium, 
rubidium and caesium. Preliminary loading experiments with a range of resins with different forms were 
undertaken and the absorption results shown in  Figure 38 and Figure 39.

It was predicted that the strong cationic resin would load rubidium , caesium  and lithium with minimal  sodium, or 
potassium , while the weak cationic resins would load sodium and potassium with little rubidium, caesium or 
lithium .  The results shown in Figure 38 support these predictions where the strong cationic  resins  (Dowex E26 & 
Purolite D5412H) and weak cationic resins (Purolite C104 & Lewatit CNP80) loaded as expected .  The resin Lewatit 
CNP80 should be further investigated as it loaded very little (<1%) of the rubidium, caesium and lithium . 
For the strong anionic  resin  (Ambersep 920U), weak anionic resin (Lewatit VPOC1065) and chelating resin ( Purolite 
S930) it was predi cted these resins would load the aluminium, iron, magnesium and manganese.  The results 
shown in Figure 39 support these predictions .  However, these resins  also load ed the  rubidium, caesium,  lithium  
and potassium with minor sodium , which was not predicted.  This wa s most likely due to the  resin being in excess. 
The strong anionic resin will be further investigated for removal of these metal ions from solution.  
4.12.1  Preliminary column loading and elution 
Figure 40 and Figure 41 shows the elemental deportment from strong anionic resin (Ambersep 920U).  It shows 
the major species (Li, Rb, Cs, K and Na) did not load as expected.  For t he minor species (Ca, Al, Si, Fe, Ca, Mg, Mn 
and F) it was hard to see what was happening as there was very little change in the concentration of species (likely 
reached dilution and assay limits) but there was a clear increase at sample number 30 which correlates to the 
addition of the wash water.  This suggest s these species were only weakly bound or loaded on to the anion 
exchange resin and we re easily removed by water.  0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100%

Fe, Ca, Mg, Mn and F) showed very little change although during elution there wa s an increase with all these

4.12.2  Two stage solution purification  
4.12.2.1  Run 1  
Two runs with 20 and 80  mL of the strong anionic resin (Ambersep 920U) followed by weak cationic resins (Lewatit 
CNP80) where performed at room temperature ( ~ 20 °C).  The first run utilising 20 mL of each resin  and the  
elemental distribution are shown in Figure 44 and Figure 45 for the Amber sep 920U and in Fi gure 46 and Figure 
47 for the Lewatit CNP80.  Ambersep 920U did not load the major species but did load weakly the minor species 
with them being displaced during the water wash.  Therefore there is no need to elute the resin as they were 
displaced during the water wash.  Lewatit CNP80 results showed the lithium is being displaced by K, Cs, Rb and Na 
in solution but still some lithium remained on the resin.   The deportment of elements on the resin to filtrate and 
accountabilities are presented in Table 27.  The results confirm the resin will load K, Rb, Na, and Cs over the 
lithium.Figure 44.  Major Species from strong anionic resin (Ambersep 920U ) (Run 1).

The second  run utilising 80 mL of each resin and the elemental distribution are shown in Figure 48 and Figure 49 
for the Ambersep 920U and in Figure 50 and Figure 51 for the Lewatit CNP80.  Ambersep 920U once again did not 
load the major species but did load weakly the minor s pecies which were  displaced off the resin during the water 
wash.  Lewatit CNP80 results showed the lithium and sodium were being displaced by K, Cs and  Rb in solution but 
still a considerable amount of lithium remained on the resin.   The deportment of elem ents on the resin to filtrate 
and accountabilities are presented in  Table 28.  The results confirm the resin will load in the preference K, Rb, Cs, 
and Na  over the li thium. Figure 44.  Major Species from strong anionic resin (Ambersep 920U ) (Run 1).

4.12.3  Equilibrium loadings  
To understand the maximum loading achievable from the solution equilibrium resin loading experiments were 
undertaken  with the weak cationic resin (Lewatit CNP80) .  The results are shown in Figure 52 where it show s the 
loading of Cs, Rb and Li will rise sharply to reach a maximum loading of 80 g/L onto the resin.  K had the highest 
preference followed by Na, Li, Rb and Cs.

 4.13 Electro dialysis  
Preliminary electrodialysis test  was unde rtaken using synthetic solution  of lithium sulphate  under  a constant 
current  density of 35 mA/cm2.  Figure 53 shows the lithium migration from the salt chamber to the base chamber 
over a total electrolysis time of 4 hours.  
 
Figure 53.  Variation of Li concentration in salt a nd base chambers  over time . 
It can be seen that the lithium concentration in the salt chamber decreased whereas the lithium concentration in 
the base chamber increased over time.  Approximately 18 w/w% lithium in the salt chamber migrated across to the bas e chamber with an average transfer rate of 0.66 g/h lithium.  Lithium accountability for the test was 98.8%.  
The production of sulfuric acid in the acid chamber was confirmed by performing acid -base titration of the samples 
collected periodically.  Figure 54 shows that the solution acidity increased with time.  This indicates possibility of 
recovering sulfuric acid to be recycled back into the process flowsheet.  
 
Figure 54.  Variation of H+ concentration in acid chamber over time. 
Figure 55 shows the potentials measured during the test. The average cell  voltage in this test was 15.78 V.  The 
average anodic and cathodic potentials measured at 1.68 V/NHE and 2.82 V/NHE respectively.  This indicates a very high voltage drop across the cell.  0510152025303540

Figure 55.  Variation of electrolysis vo ltage over time. 
To explain the high voltage drop across the cell, it must first be pointed out that sulphate , unlike choride,  has very 
limited ionic mobility in electrolysis , which has been observed in previous work (Barmi, et al. 2013 , Confidential 
Repor t for Reed Industrial Minerals Pty Ltd).  This is therefore an expected outcome.  Apart from that, the voltage 
drop can also be due to the voltage loss on the central compartment (i.e. salt chamber) of the cell because of the 
distance between the cation exchange membrane and the anion exchange membrane.  This is evident from the 
higher temperature rise observed in the salt chamber than in the other two chambers.  Another possible cause is 
the high resistance from the membranes used.  
 
4.14 By-product evaluation  
A number of options for production of by-products  considered as potential ly important were investigated.  These 
include the production of a high quality gypsum precipitate, fluoride recovery and sodium silicate production.  
Neutralising the leach solution to pH 1 -1.5 will produce a clean gypsum product  so no further purification options 
were investigated . 
4.14.1  Precipitates  
4.14.1.1  Precipitate s izing  
An attempt was made to process representative samples from the precipitated materials formed during the 
neutralisation through a series of cyclosizers retaining a different, gradually decreasing, size fraction.  It was 
observed that there was o nly sufficient material to run s tage 1 and 2 precip itates through the cyclosizer.   Both 
precipitates were very  fine.  For the Stage 1 precipitate , the entire material passed through the final cyclone that 
has an equivalent size below 13.1  μm.  For the stage 2 precipitate , ~ 94% of the material passed through the final 
cyclone giving a n approximate  P80 of 10  μm.

4.14.2.2  Mineralogy  
XRD analyses of the five size fractions of the lepidolite leach residue showed that the distribution of mineral phases 
varied with size.  The material from cone 1 of the cyclosizer (+46.8  μm) was mostly gypsum and fluorite ( Figure 
57).  The material from cones 2 -5 were of particle size +32.7, +23.5, +16.1 and +13.3  μm, respectively contained 
various silicates ( Figure  58).

4.14.2.3  SEM -EDX examination  
SEM examination and EDX analyses of different size fractions of the leached lepidolite residue identified the same 
phases detected by XRD.  The  material from cone 1 of the cyclosizer ( Figure 59) was mostly gypsum and fluorite.  
The material from cones 2 -5 contained progressively finer silicate particles with  relatively large platy mica particles 
(Figure 60 & Figure 61).  Due to their  platy nature, these mica particles were larger than would be expected from 
the cyclosizer parameters.  Selected images and spectra from these analyses are shown in the following section.  
Note that the scales in  Figure 59-Figure 61 are the same size.  
None of the 46 EDX analyses of material from cones 2 -5 showed the presence of fluo ride.  The majority of the 
residual fluoride was in the coarse material.  This suggests the residual fluorite could be recovered by a size based 
separation.

4.14.2.4  Fluorite recycling  
Given some  of the fluorid e was present in the coarse material, it may be possible to recover and recycle unused 
fluorite by a simple size separation process.  This could reduce the amount of fresh fluorite that needs to be added 
into the leaching circuit.  A simple flowsheet for such a process is shown in Figure 70. 
 
Figure 70. Simplified flowsheet for the recycling of fluorite from the leached residue . 
A cyclone test is  needed to assess the effectiveness of this process. However, since only  10% of the contained 
fluoride  reports to the oversize material,  it may  not be economically feasible .

 4.14.3  Sodium silicate production  
The mass dissolution  data are summarised in Figure 71 and show that the amount of solid phase dissolved 
increased with increasing dosage of Na:Si, from about 25% at Na:Si mol ratio of 0.2 to 39% at Na:Si mol ratio of 
2.6 for the wet residue.  For the dry residue the mass dissolution with Na:Si mole ratio was almost linear, increas ing 
from 15% at Na:Si mol ratio of 0.2 to 39% at Na:Si mol ratio of 2.6.  Slightly more dissolution was observed from 
the dry feed above Na:Si mol ratio of 0.8 than from the wet feed.  
 
Figure 71.  Mass of feed dissolved as a function of NaOH dosage . 
The percentage dissolution s of silicon from each of the feed samples are  summarised in Figure 72. These data 
show that significantly more silicon was dissolved from the dry feed than from the wet feed.  In case of the former, 
the dissolution was approximately 0.2% even at the relatively low Na:Si mol ratio of 0.4, increasing gradually to a 
maximum  of 49.6% at the high est reagent dosage ( Na:Si mol ratio of 2.6 ). A significantly different profile was 
observed with the wet feed, where the lowest reagent dosages (0.2-0.6) resulted in very little dissolution (<  0.1%) 
of silicon before increasing almost linearly with increas ing NaOH dosage to a maximum of 41.3% at Na:Si mol ratio 
of 2.6.

 The dissolution of the other  major  elements in the residue (Li,  Rb, Fe , Mg, K  and F) are  summarised in Figure 73 
and Figure 74 for the dry and wet feed , respectively .  These data show that considerable amounts of Li, Rb , K, Mg  
and F dissolved from the material, in particular from the wet feed.  The dissolution s of Fe (and Al, not plotted) 
were generally below 5%.

The chemical compositions of each of the filtrates are given in Table 36 and Table 37.  Th e data show that there 
was a significant increase before a gradual decrease in the silicon concentration in the tests with dry residue, while 
there was a gradual increase in the tests with the wet residue  above a Na:Si molar ratio of 0.8 . Below this 
concentration very little silicon dissolved. Th e gradual decrease in the silicon conc entration for the dry residue 
was attributed to dilution of the silicon concentration by the further addition of the 5 M NaOH reagent solution 
above a Na:Si molar ratio of 1.2 once the maximum  silico n dissolution ha d been reached.

4.14.3.1  Kinetic tests  
The rate of sodium silicate formation was tested with a Na:Si molar ratio of 2.6 . The rate of mass dissolution  is 
shown  in Figure 75 while the  rate of  silicon dissolution is shown  in Figure 76.  The kinetic data show that  36% of  
the mass of the dry residue  dissolved in 3 hours with 40% dissolving over 24 hours. Under the same conditions,  
29% of the mass of wet residue dissolved in  3 hours , increasing to  44% in 24 hours.  In both tests,  the extent of 
silicon dissolution was similar, increasing to a maximum of 50% over  24 hours.

dissolution of K, Mg , F and Fe were similar. C onsiderably more Li  and Rb dissolved (20 to 80% and 34  to 65% , 
respectively) from  the wet residue.

4.14.3.2  Autoclave leaching  
For comparison with the sodium silicate formation tests reported above, carried out under atmospheric pressure, 
a test was also conducted under conventional conditions used in the production of this material which involve high temperature and pressure.   The test was conducted in a Parr 2 L titanium autoclave at 220  °C with a residence 
time of 1 hr.  While the leach results for the dry residue were comparable to those obtained in the 100 °C tests, 
the dissolution of silica from the wet residue autoclave test was about half of what was achieved from the 100 °C 
leach tests ( Figure 79).  Once again, more impurities were dissolved from  the wet residue product  than the dry 
residue product .

 4.14.3.3  Sodium silicate residue characterisation  
There was a change in the prominence of different phases in the residue depending on the NaOH dose  (Figure 80). 
The broad hump from 18 -33° disappears from the XRD patterns once the Na:Si ratio exceeds 0.4. It was at this 
point that silicon was also observed to dissolve. It is thought that this corresponds to the dissolution of an 
amorphous silicate phase in the leached residue once a minimum sodium hydroxide dosage is reached.  
 
Figure 80. XRD patterns for the residue  left after sodium silicate production with varied NaOH dosage . 
 
MRIWA Solution Purification and By -Product Formation – Final Report  Page 61 
 A mica phase, possibly trilithionite (lepidolite) is present in all residues, indicating that it is not attacked by sodium 
hydroxide.  Quartz was also present in all residues suggesting incomplete dissolution. While gypsum was identified 
in the leached residue, it was not present in the residues after treatment with NaOH  above a Na:S i ratio of 0.4 and 
above . Calculations with HSC Chemistry v7.1.1 indicate that the conversion of gypsum to calcium hydroxide is 
favourable at high pH.  However, c rystalline calcium hydroxide was not identified in the residues.

here was another peak around 22° 2θ in several of the residues. It is not clear with which mineral this peak is 
associated. As with the EDX analyses, not all silicate phases present could be defin itively identified . 
4.14.3.4  Accountability  
The average accountability for the main elements for the Na:Si dosage tests are summarised in Table 38.  The 
kinetic  accountabilitie s are shown in  Table 39.  The data appears reasonably sound for all elements confirming the 
validity of the observed findings.

4.15 Alunite Production  Process  
Given the precipitating products of aluminium contribute to lithium loss , it would desirable to remove some of 
this aluminium before neutralisation.  So t he production of alunite from the lepidolite leach liquor was examined.  
This is where potassium sulphate  (K2SO 4) is added and  contacted with the leach liquor to form an alunite 
(KAl(SO 4)2) precipitate  at 80 °C .

t was found 80% and 100% stoichiometric  amount of potassium sulphate produced a precipitate but 50% did not 
and t he precipitate s redissolved when washed  water.  The analysis of the wash solution which contained entrained 
liquor and precipi tate are showed the following results ( Figure 81). 
 
MRIWA Solution Purification and By -Product Formation – Final Report  Page 62 
  
Figure 81.  Alunite composition from the leach liquor  at different stoichiometric addition of K 2SO 4. 
The results showed that alunite or another aluminium precipitate formed under these acidic conditions at high 
potassium sulphate additions, even though in the absorption tests both the alunite and gibbsite pr ecipitates 
dissolved at pH 1. The results also showed  that aluminium would  absorb  the fluoride with minimum  lithium loss 
(< 8%).  It is therefore possible that a fluoride rich precipitate could be formed after stage 1 precipitation with 
addition of potassium sulphate.  It is likely that the original results presented in the initial report for stage 1 seeding 
was due to addition of the wrong seed in that the stage 2 precipitate was used which contains aluminium precipitates which resulted in similar fluoride  and lithium adsorption.  To confirm the validity of these results the 
accountabilities are presented in Table 40 below , showing poor accountabilities for the major elements Ca and Si, 
as well as the minor elements Fe and Mn .

This work was r epeated  with bulk test runs of the process where alunite was initially precipitated followed by the 
three stages of neutralisation.  It was found that  at 80 °C alunite did not precipitate but needed to be cooled to 
room temperature to form.  T wo test runs were performed as , in the first run , too much lime was added in stage 
2 that resulted in the pH increasing  to stage 3 pH.  It was noted in this test that, c uriously , not all the fluoride 
precipitated ( Table 41).   
The filtratio n results of these runs are presented below ( Table 41 & Table 42).  While the fluoride did precipitate 
with the alunite it was  only ~ 30% not 90% which we found in the preliminary runs.   However , considerably less 
 
MRIWA Solution Purification and By -Product Formation – Final Report  Page 63 
 lithium and rubidium ( ~ 50%) was lost to the neutralisation precipitates  compared to three stage neutralisation .  
Nonetheless , there was considerably more caesium  (~ 30%) that precipitated with  the alunite. The accountabilities 
of these runs are presented in Table 43.

4.16 Final Products  
To complete the project, precipitation of lithium carbonate  as final product and other target species like rubidium 
and caesium  were investigated .  Stoichiometric addition of sodium carbonate was added at 80 °C to the final 
filtrate and the precipitate filtered after 10 minutes and 24 hours.  The elemental distrib utions of the precipitate 
from  this test are presented in Table 44.  The results showed very  little lithium precipitated, rather the calcium 
was removed and there was  very little difference between the 10 minutes and 24 hour  results.  This was most 
likely due to  the solubility of calcium carbonate being  2000 fold lower tha n lithium carbonate . Hence, calcium 
carbonate preferentially  precipitate d from solution.  
 
MRIWA Solution Purification and By -Product Formation – Final Report  Page 64 
  
A furthe r test was conducted where  carbon dioxide was added and after removing the precipitate , stoichiometric 
amounts  of aluminium sulphate or sodium sulph ate was added and the precipitate filtered  followed by cooling of 
the precipitate at < 5 °C overnight.  Th is test was to recover the Rb and Cs as a double sulph ate precipitat e and 
possibly recover any  potassium as a sulphate precipitate through cooling.  The results of this series of tests are 
presented in Table 45.  The carbon dioxide did precipitate some lithium but also precipitated the calcium.    Adding 
aluminium sulphate recovered some of the rubidium and caesium and cooling the precipitate result ed in 
precipitation of most of the  potassium and any residual calcium.  It also highlights that the Rb and Cs have been 
recovered and any potassium could be recovered utilising the excess sulph ate in the solution.

 5 Conclusions  and Recommendations  
The following conclusions can be summarised from this work:  
Phase 1 
Stage 1 neutralisation  
• A calcite dosage of 243 kg/m3 was needed to raise pH to 1 in 4 hours at any temperature in the range 
25-80 °C, with or without seeding;  
• The kinetic precipitation tests showed that a temperature > 50 °C was needed to minimise lithium and 
rubidium ( ~ 5%) losses with calcite ; 
• Silica and magnesium precipitation  were greater at temperature < 50 °C while iron precipitation was  
greater at 80 °C; 
• Seeding promoted the precipitation of all species  at all temperatures ; and  
• Gypsum was the major and only crystalline phase identified in the precipitate.  
Stage 2 neutralisation  
• A hydrated lime dosage of 80 kg/m3 was needed to raise the pH to 5 -6 in 6 hours at any temperature in 
the range 25 -80 °C, with or without seeding; 
• This stage showed the greatest losses of lithium (15 -23%), rubidium (9 -67%) and caesium (56 -94%) to 
the precipitate ; 
• Seeding showed little effect at 8 0 °C but did promote precipitation at 25  °C; 
• Lowering the temperature would reduce  the rubidium, caesium and fluoride precipitation ; and  
• Gypsum was again the main crystalline phase identified in the precipitate but it is where most of the 
aluminium, fluoride and silica are  precipitated.  A new fluoride species ( not predicted by HSC software) 
was identified whi ch was associated with the hydrated aluminium ( AlF 3-x(OH) x∙nH 2O). 
Stage 3 neutralisation  
• A hydrated lime dosage of 26 kg/m3 was needed to raise pH to 13 in 6 hours regardless of the 
temperature or if seeded or not;  
• Minimal lithium (1 -10%), rubidium (1 -6%) or caesium (0.1 -0.3%) was lost to the precipitate at 80 °C but 
the loss increased at 25 °C;  
• Seeding had no significant effect; and  
• Manganese hydroxide was identified in the precipitate, along with calcium hydroxide which indicated 
that not all the Ca(OH) 2 reacted.  
Oxidation or reduction  
• Addition of peroxide (H 2O2) or sulphite (SO 32-) showed a very little effect . There was a  slightly higher 
lithium loss but neither will assist the neutralisation stage.  
Filtration  
• The higher the temperature the faster the filtration rate;  
• There was no comparable difference between the seeded and unseeded tests; and  
• The filtration rate for stage 1 with CaCO 3 was the fastest followed by stage 2 with Ca(OH) 2 then stage 3 
with Ca(OH) 2.

 Li absorption  
• Apart from gypsum , the two main precipitates, gibbsite (Al(OH) 3) and alunite ( KAl 3(SO 4)2(OH) 6) absorbed  
~ 50% of the lithium from a synthetic solution;  
• The other precipitates absorbed < 20% lithium ; and  
• Testing on real solutions confirmed that in stage 2 filtrate (pH ~ 5), gibbsite and alunite are the main 
adsorbers of lithium from solution. 
Phase 2 
IX ad sorption  
• The strong anion exchange resin (Ambersep 920U) was  used to recover the metal ions while a weak 
cationic exchange resin (Lewatit CNP80)  was used to recover the potassium and sodium;  
• Testing confirmed that metal ions can be recovered from solution, but the extent was limited as they 
formed both anionic and cationic complexes in solution;  
• The bonding was weak and the adsorbed ions were easily displaced with water wash; and  
• The results of the weak cationic exchange resin (Lewatit CNP80)  confirm ed the resin will load K, Rb, Cs , 
and Na over the lithium . 
Electrod ialysis 
• Preliminary tests confirmed that lithium hydroxide can be produced from lithium sulphate  by electro -
dialysis .   
• Sulfuric acid was produced as a by -product and can be potentially recycled back into the process 
flowsheet.  
By-product production  
Sodium silicate by -product from leach residue  
• The production of sodium silicate from the SiLeachTM residue s was possible at the less aggressive 
atmospheric conditions (100  °C).  However, the conv ersion and extraction was low ( ~ 50 %); 
• It was determined that the dry feed was more reactive than the wet feed,  which also  dissolved fewer 
impurities ; and  
• A Na:Si mol ratio s of less than 0.4 for the dry residue and less than 0.8 for the wet residue very little 
silicon dissolved (< 1%).  
Size analysis of leach residue  
• In the coarsest fraction (+46.8 μm)  mainly gypsum and fluorite was identified by XRD while the finer 
fractions indicated unreacted phyllosilicates;  
• SEM confirmed the results showing platy mica in the finer size fractions , and gypsum and fluorite were 
identified in the coarsest fraction;  
• This suggests the residual fluorite could be recovered by a size -based separation ; and  
• Size by size assay confirmed the concentration of fluorite in this fraction but this fraction only contained 
10% of the total fluoride in the sample.  
By-p roducts from precipitates  
• Sizing  showed stage 1 and 2 precipitates were very fine;  
• Size by assaying showed the  elements were evenly distributed throughout the size fractions so sizing 
could not be used to separate a particular precipitate from the bulk precipitates; and  
 
MRIWA Solution Purification and By -Product Formation – Final Report  Page 67 
 • Magnetic separation and flotation c ould not be used to separate a particular precipitate from the bulk 
precipitates . 
Alunite  Process  
• The production of alunite from the lepidolite leach liquor has been investigate d where varying 
stoichiometric amounts of potassium sulphate w ere added to the solution;  
• A precipitate was observed in 80% and 100% stoichiometry but when washed with water the precipitate 
dissolved;  
• The predicted residue composition from  the wash solution  shows that the alunite will absorb fluoride, 
calcium and caesium;  
• Further testing showed  ~ 30% of the fluoride will be recovered in the alunite precipitate along with 
caesium;  
• This method reduced the lithium and rubidium loss by 50% over the traditional three stages of 
neutralisation. 
 
The following recommendations are proposed:  
Effect on neutralisation chemical  
• Calcite should be used to neutralise the liquor to pH 1 - 1.5 followed by solid/liquid separation to  
remove most of the gypsum as  clean by -produc t; 
• A temperature of 80  °C is recommended for stage 1 but a lower temperature of 50  °C should be 
considered for stages 2 and 3;  
• Addition of peroxide or sulphite is not recommended; and  
• Seeding is only recommended for stage 1.  
Absorption  
• Gibbsite and alunite  appear to be the main precipitate s that can be associated with the lithium loss es, 
where alunite would also absorb all the other key elements from solutions;  
• Further work to minimise alunite forming should be investigated through the use of ion exchange resins 
to remove potassium from solution.  
Sodium silicate production  
• Further understanding of what form of silica is being dissolved (amorphous or crystalline) to explain the poor dissolution;  
• Further work at different temperatures and feed variability is required to assess the effects of these 
process parameters on the cost and utility of the process; and 
• Other uses for the amorphous silica in the final residue , such as an additive to fertilisers,  should be 
investigated . 
Ion-exchange purification  
• Further elution testing needs to be investigated to determine if selective elution can be achieved; and  
• Further equilibrium loadings on synthetic solutions should provide the maximum loading of  each 
element achievable with that resin.  
 
MRIWA Solution Purification and By -Product Formation – Final Report  Page 68 
  
Alunite production  
• Further tests are needed to confirm if an alunite/fluoride precipitate will produce a residue suitable for 
recycling back to leaching; and  
• Further tests are needed to confirm if lower lithium lo sses are observed by using this process.  
Electro -dialysis  
• Further optimisation  to reduc e voltage loss is required, which includes testing at different cell 
parameters and with different membranes; and  
• Testing with  real solutions is required .
