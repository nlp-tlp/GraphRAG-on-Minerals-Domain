2 | P a g eExecutive Summary 
The Panton Sill deposit in the East Kimberley region of Western Australia is one of only a few Platinum 
Group Metal (PGM) deposits in Australia. The deposit has a declared resource of 14.32 million tonnes 
at 2.19g/t Pt, 2.39g/t Pd, 0.31g/t Au. From an economic perspective, it is important to find a suitable 
method to extract all the PGMs and precious metals (gold). Whilst palladium and gold were found to 
be less  problematic  for most  lixiviants,  platinum  minerals  are  often  much more  refractory.  In 
particular, sperrylite (PtAs 2) has been found to be refractory to direct leach approaches. Sperrylite is 
the dominant Pt-bearing mineral in the PGM-enriched chromitites and accounts for about 55.31% of 
the Pt in Panton  Sill Deposit.  Therefore,  it is crucial from  a financial  feasibility  perspective  that a 
suitable lixiviant be found that can leach sperrylite. 
This report summarises all work completed for MRIWA Project M0458, which contributed to the PhD 
study by Cleophace Ngoie Mpinga under the supervision of Professor Jacques Eksteen, Professor Chris 
Aldrich and Dr Laurence Dyer. Additional research was undertaken by Dr Alireza Rabieh in 2018 and 
2019.  
In 2017,  metallurgical  test  work  consisting  of chloride  salt  roasting  followed  by acid  leaching  was 
undertaken  using  a Panton  Sill ore  sample.   The  results indicated  that  the  chloride  salt  roasting 
followed by an acid leaching process (6M HCl) extracted all the PGMs in the ore.  
Further investigative  chloride  salt  roasting  followed  by HCl leaching was  performed  on a flotation 
concentrate,  during  the course  of 2018  to 2019.  The  results indicated  that  the process  was  able to 
extract  the PGMs  from  the  flotation  concentrate  as well. However, the process  required around  4 
tonnes of chloride  salts  per  ton  of concentrate  and  will  generate  very  corrosive  gases  during  the 
roasting process.  
During the  course of 2019, a new  method was  developed  to process the flotation concentrate with 
conventional  roasting  followed  by HCl/NaCl/H 2O2 leaching,  and  the results  show ed almost  all the 
PGMs  were  leached.  In this  leaching  system,  hydrogen  peroxide (H2O2) was  used  as the  oxidizing 
agent, hydrochloric  acid  (HCl) was  used  as the leaching agent  and sodium  chloride (NaCl)  was 
employed  to provide  chloride  ions  (Cl−) for PGM  complexing.  The  results show  that  increasing  the 
percent solids of the leach slurry up to 25% didn’t affect the extraction and  most of the PGMs were 
extracted (97% Pt, 90% Pd and 97% Au). Furthermore, the precipitation process demonstrated a good 
separation of PGMs and base metals from other gangue metals like iron/aluminium.  3 | P a g eTable of Contents

 1. Introduction  
The Panton Sill deposit is located 60km north of Halls Creek, adjacent to the Great Northern Highway 
in the East Kimberley Region of Western Australia.  The remoteness of the site, the size of the deposit, 
and the challenges to produce high-grade, low-chromite flotation concentrates suitable for smelting, 
has initiated research into hydrometallurgical extraction options as processing alternatives. Earlier 
research which was patented by Bax et al. (2009), identified a process using calcining of the 
concentrates followed by cyanidation leaching and ion exchange. Lonmin Plc was the patent holder at 
the time. However, environmental sensitivities made the intensive use of (sodium) cyanide in the 
Kimberley region unacceptable. This necessitated a search for alternative metallurgical approaches. 
Mpinga et al. (2015) reviewed a number of alternative processing options, identifying acidic 
thiocyanate leaching and alkaline glycine leaching (as patented by Eksteen and Oraby (2014, 2015)) as 
potential alternative options for the direct leaching of the Panton Sill ore. From an economic 
perspective, it is important to find a suitable lixiviant for all the PGMs and precious metals (gold). 
Whilst palladium and gold were found to be less problematic for most lixiviants, irrespective 
mineralisation typical of PGM ores, platinum minerals have been found to be much more refractory, 
if not thermally treated. In particular, sperrylite (PtAs 2) has been found to be particularly refractory to 
direct leach approaches. 
Sperrylite is the dominant Pt-bearing mineral in the PGM-enriched chromitites and is mainly hosted 
by chalcopyrite in these nickel-copper ores. It accounts for about 55.31% of the maximum amount of 
extractable Pt and has been identified as a slow-leaching mineral (limiting-step) in cyanide, especially 
in comparison with the Au and Pd minerals (Mwase et al., 2012; Eksteen et al., 2012; Lewins and 
Greenaway, 2004). Whilst the leaching of all the PGMs are of importance, it is crucial from a financial 
feasibility perspective that a suitable lixiviant be found that can leach sperrylite (given that the other 
minerals will dissolve faster). 
Due to mineralogical complexities and the PGM textural associations with gangue minerals, it is a 
particularly difficult ore to process. The deposit is not large enough to warrant the investment into a 
smelter, gas handling and matte leach facility, as has been the convention with other PGM deposits in 
Southern Africa and Russia. To date, the concentrates that could be prepared at acceptable PGM 
recoveries suffered from being too low grade for smelting, over and above the large transport costs 
associated with transporting low-grade concentrate over large distances. The purpose of this research 
is to develop an alternative flotation and leaching technology for PGM-bearing chromitite ore that 
would eliminate smelting and pressure leaching.

 1.1. Flotation  
Flotation recovery from PGM bearing ores depends on the mineralogy of the ore and the way the 
deposit is formed. From the beneficiation point of view, PGM-bearing ores can be classified into the 
following categories: (1) Deposits of magmatic origin, where the PGMs are associated with base metal 
sulphides, typical deposit: Merensky Reef in South Africa; (2) Chromium deposits containing PGM 
minerals, where the relationship between chromium, the PGMs and the type of PGM minerals in these 
deposits depends largely on the geological environment. Therefore, the processing characteristics of 
these ore types are quite variable ; (3) High chromium oxidized PGM ores, these ores are found in Brazil 
and Australia. These ores belong to a group of highly refractory ores and usually give poor concentrate 
grade and PGM recovery. The PGMs are either associated with oxidized sulphides (pyrite, nickel), or 
partly present as PGM alloys (Bulatovic, 2003; Chapman et al., 2011). 
The use of sulphidisation as a technique to recover base metal minerals by flotation has been used for 
many years. Chingola and Katanga mines in the Central African copper belt are well-known examples 
of this practice (Ray, 1979; Anon., 1985). In North America, the ASARCO mining company at their San 
Diego Mill recovered oxidised lead minerals by this method from as early as the 1920s (Monks et al, 
1930). 
In this process, sulphidisers, such as sodium sulphide or sodium hydrosulphide were added to the 
flotation systems with manual regulation like other reagents, such as for collectors, frothers and 
depressants (Jones et al, 1978; Ray, 1979; Anon., 1985; Lee et al., 2009).  
The sulphidisation reaction using sodium sulphide as an example can be represented as in Equation 1 
M2+A 2- + 2Na+ + S2- ―  M2+S2- + 2Na+ +  A2-       (1) 
Where  M2+ = Surface metal ion 
A2- = Anion resulting from oxidation 
However, depending on pulp chemistry conditions it is generally considered that the HS- ion is the 
active species. Thus the minerals with freshly formed sulphide surfaces then become floatable using 
standard equipment and reagents for sulphide mineral flotation. 
Furthermore, Lee et al. (2009) found an improvement in the flotation performance of pentlandite 
when sodium dithionite (Na 2S2O4) was used as a sulphidiser. By comparison, when NaHS was used as 
a sulphidiser, the flotation of pentlandite was also improved but was less selective with a poor 
separation of pentlandite and serpentine.     
It is well known that the valuable sulphide minerals reporting to the flotation tailings are oxidised to 
some extent. The nature of this oxidisation is evident as tarnished surfaces or surface oxide coatings 6 | P a g e  
 of the underlying primary sulphide minerals. The oxidation reactions arise from the presence of 
oxidants as well as galvanic interactions between sulphide minerals, milling media and solution 
species. By using nitrogen gas to exclude oxygen and by careful control of the sulphidisation process 
it has been possible to increase the flotation recovery of chalcocite, chalcopyrite and bornite that 
would otherwise have reported to tailings.  
Two Cytec flotation reagent used for this project are:  
(1) AERO 3477 is a Dithiophosphate (R= isobutyl) type of promoter. It is a strong, but selective 
collector for Cu, Ni and activated Zn minerals. It also improves recoveries of precious metals, 
particularly those of the platinum group metals. 
(2) AEROPHINE 3418A is a Dialkyl dithiophosphinates type of promoter. It is a unique, P-based 
sulfide collector. It was originally developed for the flotation of copper and activated zinc 
minerals. It has since been found to be an invaluable (and often irreplaceable) collector in the 
beneficiation of complex, polymetallic, and massive sulfide ores. With these ores it provides 
very selective separations. It is highly effective for galena and precious metals, especially 
silver. Its main attributes are strong collecting power but with excellent selectivity against iron 
sulfide minerals, unactivated sphalerite and penalty elements. On many ores, the dosage 
required may be considerably lower than that needed for traditionally used non-selective 
collectors such as xanthates. 
 
1.2. Hydrometallurgical process  
1.2.1.  Chloride based process   
A. Kell process   
The Kell process is a patented hydrometallurgical alternative to PGM smelting. This process is a mixed 
chloride/sulphate based technology, where base metals are removed by sulphuric acid pressure 
leaching and PGMs are leached after roasting with Cl2/HCl as commonly used in PGM refining. 
However, the solution concentrations of PGMs for the Kell process tend to be lower. According to 
Liddell et al. (2010) and Tatarnikov et al. (2004), the technology is insensitive to the chromite content 
in the feed. Criticisms of the Kell process are that Cl2 gas is highly corrosive requiring special materials 
of construction and therefore results in both high capital and operating costs if such technology is 
adopted. The same arguments prevail for any chloride-based process. Liddell and Adams (2012) have 
argued that chlorination leaching has become a standard unit process in PGM refineries. Furthermore, 
the long-term materials performance is not as well proven. Finally, one of the challenges for all PGM 
refineries, when evaluating new routes, is the introduction of more contaminants such as S, Se, Te, Bi, 7 | P a g e  
 Cr, Hg, Si, Pb, etc. These contaminants are often not sufficiently well evaluated during the process 
development. 
 
B. Outokumpu HydroCopper® process 
The HydroCopper® process (chloride-based leaching process) developed by Outokumpu Technology 
in Finland, involves counter current leaching of chalcopyrite concentrates using air or oxygen and 
chlorine as oxidants. Copper sulphide concentrate is leached in a strong NaCl solution. In typical 
HydroCopper® technology, NaCl concentrations are 230 to 280 g/L, solution pH can vary between 1.5 
and 2.5 and temperature between 80 and 100°C at atmospheric pressure (Lundström et al., 2005, 
2009; Senanayake, 2009). Generally, chalcopyrite leaching in chloride media, with Cu2+ as oxidant, is 
more effective than in sulphate media with Fe3+ as oxidant (Lundström, 2009; Lundström et al., 2007). 
Cupric ion concentration should be greater than 9 g/L for successful operations (Lundström et al., 
2005). Gold is leached at potentials of > 800 mV (vs. SHE) and then recovered from the pregnant 
solution by precipitating it on activated carbon or copper concentrate. The HydroCopper® chloride 
process has reached commercial maturity scale in Mongolia and at the Morenci mine in Arizona. 
However, the process has not been used to date in conjunction with PGMs and copper-gold ores. 
 
C. Molten salt chlorination roasting 
To our best knowledge, chlorine gas is required to leach the platinum in chlorination process (Liddell 
and Adams, 2012; Tatarnikov et al., 2004). PGM-bearing concentrates are leached under aggressive 
conditions in an HCl/Cl 2 medium (Sole et al., 2005). The HCl/Cl 2 leach approach is not suitable for low-
grade ores or concentrates, but rather highly concentrated PGM feedstocks as found in PGM 
refineries. Although the direct use of chlorine gas was not considered in this work, similar aggressive 
leach conditions could be indirectly created through the pyrohydrolysis of some low-cost and readily 
available chlorinating salts.  
In this project, a molten salt chlorination bake process performed at 650°C, which lies just below the 
temperatures at which copper and nickel ferrites form (670 and 764°C, respectively) and just above 
the temperatures (500 to 600°C) at which PtAs 2 starts to decompose (Muir and Ariti, 1991; Okamoto, 
1990) would be appropriate to volatilize and remove arsenic in the off-gas stream or as a calcium 
arsenate Ca 3(AsO 4)2 compound (Mpinga et al., 2018a). 
The melting point of chloride salts varies significantly depending on their degree of hydration. It is 
772°C for CaCl 2 and 714 °C for MgCl 2. At a molar ratio of 1:1, Venkatesh et al. (2016) found that 
MgCl 2/CaCl 2 eutectic melting occurs at 625 °C. According to Doná et al. (2009), Cl 2 is able to attack 
PtAs 2 to form PtCl 4 (Eqs. (3, 4)). Platinum chloride (PtCl 4) is the only chloride of platinum species that 8 | P a g e  
 is soluble in water (Renner et al., 2001; Gee, 1920). Other PGM chlorides that could form during the 
roasting stage may include: PtCl 2, PtCl 3, PtCl 4 and PdCI 2 (Chusova and Semenova, 2008). 
During chloride salt roasting, it is assumed that HCl/Cl 2 (gas) is generate d (reaction 2 and 3) which then 
reacts with the metals in the concentrate. It has been confirmed by other researchers that the HCl/Cl 2 
react with the metals in the concentrate to produce metal chloride forms such as TiCl 2 and NiCl 2.  
2MgCl 2*6H 2O + O 2= 2MgO + 12H 2O (g) + 2Cl 2(g)       (2) 
2CaCl 2*6 H 2O + O 2 = 2CaO + 12H 2O (g) + 2Cl 2(g)       ( 3) 
PtAs 2 + 5CaCl 2*6H 2O + 5SiO 2 + 2.5O 2(g) = 5CaSiO 3 + PtCl 4 + 2AsCl 3(l) + 30H 2O(g)   (4) 
PtAs 2 + 5MgCl 2*6H 2O + 5SiO 2 + 2.5O 2(g) = 5MgSiO 3 + PtCl 4 + 2AsCl 3(l) + 30H 2O(g)   (5) 
Pt + 2 Cl 2→ PtCl 4          (6) 
 
1.2.2.  Conventional roasting followed by HCl/NaCl/H 2O2 leaching  
A new leaching system was developed to process the flotation concentrate with conventional roasting 
followed by HCl/NaCl/H 2O2 leaching. In this leaching system, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was taken as 
the oxidizing agent, hydrochloric acid (HCl) was taken as the leaching agent and sodium 
chloride (NaCl) was employed to provide Cl− for PGMs complexing.

 2.2. Flotation  
Rougher/scavenger flotation test work w as carried out with two reagent regimes (SENMIN and 
sulphidisation plus Cytec reagent) on a representative sample in order to test the suitability of 
flotation in concentrating the PGMs found in the samples and to select the best reagent regimes and 
dosage suitable for optimum recovery.   
With regards to the sulphidisation and Cytec reagent test work, it should be noted that nitrogen gas 
was added to control the dissolved oxygen concentration before, during and after sulphidisation 
conditioning. Typically, dissolved oxygen values of less than 1 ppm were controlled to initiate 
sulphidisation in the presence of nitrogen. During sulphidisation, sufficient sulphidising agent (sodium 
dithionite) was added to maintain target Eh values. Typically this was around -400 mV. Sulphidising 
agent was added in solid directly to the pulp stirred in the flotation cell. Cell agitation was adjusted to 
minimise the induction of air during sulphidisation conditioning. The time taken in the conditioning 
step was found to be of some importance. Generally this time was 3 minutes. Collector addition was 
made after sulphidisation, nitrogen was used as the  flotation gas. 
Each concentrate was collected by hand scraping the froth from the surface of the pulp. The pulp 
chemistry (Eh, pH and dissolved oxygen) was recorded throughout the test work. Tap water was added 
during flotation to maintain the pulp level in the flotation cell. The wet weights of all concentrates and 
tailing samples were recorded to enable the water recovery to be calculated. These samples were 
subsequently filtered and dried. The dry samples were submitted for assays. The flotation conditions 
tested are summarised in Table 3 and 4.

2.3. Roasting and Leaching equipment 
Roasting tests were conducted in a muffle furnace (Figure 1). The roasting was conducted at different 
temperatures up to 700°C for 6 hr in a covered crucible, then was cooled to room temperature inside 
the furnace. Leaching tests were conducted on the residues in 6M HCl at 95°C for 6 hr in a jacketed 
sleeve glass reactor to allow temperature control.  
Figure 1.  (a) Muffle furnace (b) experimental set-up used for HCl leaching. 
The batch reactor used in this work was a 1000 mL double jacketed glass reactor provided with a 
tapering conical bottom — 100 mm interior diameter, 243 mm in height — fitted with four attached 
baffles and water inlet/outlet connected to a thermostat-controlled water bath. The conical 
configuration facilitates good mixing. The flow pattern gives adequate solid suspension. Singh et al. 
(2011) argued that reactors with conical bottom have satisfactory flow pattern owing to very low off 
bottom clearance of the impeller.  The vessel had openings — in the li d — to introduce a dispersion 
tube for oxygen, pH electrode, to withdraw solution samples, and a central opening to fix an anchor 
(a) (b) 12 | P a g e  
 propeller stirrer for mixing the solution. The reactor was also equipped with a mercury thermometer 
and a cooling reflux condenser that allows a continuous return of volatile materials to the reaction 
mixture reducing evaporation losses as oxygen (99% purity) was bubbled throughout the experiments. 
To maintain the water balance, evaporation losses were compensated by adding distilled water and 
adjusting the slurry pH accordingly before sampling. All open ports on the lid were plugged with rubber 
stoppers to seal the reactor.  
 
 
2.4. Assays

 SENMIN reagents  
The best results were obtained under the conditions of test PGM11 (increasing the flotation reagent 
dosage and a staged addition). Using these conditions, ~75.11% of the PGMs were recovered into a 
concentrate with a mass pull of 21.59% at a concentrate grade of 24.49 g/t PGMs. Table 6 presents 
the results obtained using PGM11 conditions.  It was found that with these conditions, the PGMs within 
the sample were slow floating with only ~54% of the total PGMs recovered into a 14% mass at a 
concentrate grade of ~26 g/t PGMs within the first 5 minutes of cumulative flotation time. Floating for 
an additional 10 minutes resulted in an average of ~70% of the total PGMs being recovered into a 
~19% cumulative mass at an average concentrate grade of 26 g/t PGMs. The flotation recovery 
achieved after 15 minutes of cumulative flotation time show ed that there were significant quantities 
of slow floating PGMs within the samples.

Sulphidisation and Cytec reagents  
The results from the effects of sulphidisation with sodium dithionite and Cytec flotation reagent 
(A3477 and AP3418) additions on flotation performance of PGMs have been investigated. The best 
results were obtained when the ore was ground to P80=30µm and the pulp conditioned with 1100 g/t 
sodium dithionite  (ORP adjust ed to -400mV), 50 g/t copper sulphate, 36 g/t AP3418, 36 g/t A 3477 
and 200 g/t SIPX. With these conditions, ~80% of the PGMs were recovered into a concentrate of mass 
pull 5% at a concentrate grade of 120 g/t PGMs. Table 7 presents the results obtained under the 14 | P a g e  
 conditions of test FDP07.  In general, with these conditions the PGMs were fast floating with ~70% of 
the total PGMs recovered into a 3% mass at a concentrate grade of ~170 g/t PGMs within the first 6 
minutes of cumulative flotation time. Floating for an additional 8 minutes resulted in an average of 
~75% of the total PGMs being recovered into a ~4% cumulative mass at an average concentrate grade 
of 144 g/t PGMs. There was very low flotation recovery achieved after 14 minutes of cumulative 
flotation time showing that there was not a significant quantity of slow floating PGMs to be recovered 
with further flotation . Table 7. Flotation results obtained with FDP07 conditions

3.1.1.  PGMs recovery  
Platinum  
The platinum recovery curves for the rougher/scavenger flotation tests are shown in Figure 2. It can 
be seen that when the SENMIN reagents employed, the platinum found within the samples w as slow 
floating. By increasing the flotation time, adding scavengers and a staged addition of the reagent the 
platinum recovery improved. Under optimum conditions with SENMIN reagents and without 
sulphidisation (PGM11) the mass pull was ~20% and recovery 77%.  However, when the flotation pulp 
was conditioned with sodium dithionite (as sulphidisation reagent) and the Cytec reagents used, the 
flotation performance improved. As it can be seen in the optimum condition (FDP7) ~ 81% of the 
platinum recovered in a mass pull of ~5%. The grade-recovery curves for the rougher/scavenger 
flotation tests are shown in Figure 3. As can be seen the sulphidisation and using Cytec flotation 
reagents (A3477, AP3418) significantly improved the platinum grade in the concentrate (increased the 
cumulative grade from 11 to 55 g/t).   15 | P a g e

Palladium  
The palladium recovery curves for the rougher/scavenger flotation test are shown in Figure 4. It can 
be seen that when the SENMIN reagents employed, the palladium found within the samples was  slow 
floating. Recovery was increased by increasing the flotation time, adding scavenger flotation, and with 
a staged addition of the reagents . Under optimum conditions with SENMIN reagents and without 
sulphidisation (PGM11) the mass pull was ~20% and recovery ~76 %. However, when the flotation pulp 
was conditioned with sodium dithionite (as a sulphidisation reagent) and Cytec reagents, the flotation 
performance improved. Under optimum conditions (FDP7), ~ 80% of the palladium was recovered 
16 | P a g e  
 with a mass pull of ~5%. The palladium grade-recovery curves for the rougher/scavenger flotation 
tests are shown in Figure 5. It can be seen that sulphidisation with sodium dithionite and using Cytec 
flotation reagents (A3477, AP3418) significantly improved the palladium grade in the concentrate 
(increased the cumulative grade from 12 to 60 g/t with 80% recovery).

Gold  
The gold recovery curves for the rougher/scavenger flotation test are shown in Figure 6. It can be seen 
when the SENMIN reagents were employed, the gold found within the samples w as slow floating 
which by increasing the flotation time, adding scavenger and stage addition of the reagents improved 
17 | P a g e  
 the gold recovery. Under optimum conditions with SENMIN reagents and without sulphidisation 
(PGM11) the mass pull was ~20% and recovery ~72 %. However, when the flotation pulp was 
sulphidised with sodium dithionite and Cytec flotation reagents used, the flotation performance 
improved. This can be seen under the optimum conditions (FDP7), where ~ 80% of the gold was 
recovered with a mass pull of ~5%. The gold grade-recovery curves for the rougher/scavenger flotation 
tests are shown in Figure 7. It can be seen that the sulphidisation with sodium dithionite and using 
Cytec flotation reagents (A3477, AP3418) significantly improved the gold grade in the concentrate 
(increased the cumulative grade from 1 to 7 g/t).

 3.1.2.  Mineralogy study  
A mineralogical investigation, with emphasis on the platinum group minerals, was carried out on 
flotation products (Table 8). The overall mineral compositions of the flotation products reflect the 
ultramafic mineral assemblage of the composite. Chromite (the primary oxide mineral), olivine and 
orthopyroxene (the primary silicate minerals) occur together with various secondary minerals 
including chlorite, serpentine, talc and amphibole. The products also contain some carbonates (mainly 
dolomite and magnesite), iron oxides/oxyhydroxides, ilmenite and other trace minerals. QEMSCAN 
analysis indicated that complex alteration products of the Ni and Cu sulphides may be present in the 
samples.

The nickel mineralisation is dominated by pentlandite which has been extensively altered to the more 
Ni-rich violarite resulting in a wide range in Ni:Fe ratios for the combined ‘pentlandite/violarite’ phase. 
Combined ‘pentlandite/violarite’ accounts for about 90% of the nickel in the concentrates (more 
details in Table 9). A smaller amount of the nickel is hosted by nickeline and gersdorffite as well as by 
secondary nickel phases which appear to include oxides, hydroxides, carbonates and/or silicates and 20 | P a g e  
 which have not been fully characterised in this study. The secondary Ni phases probably account for a 
significant amount (more than half) of the Ni in the Mid Tail samples (and probably also in the Final 
Tails which was not submitted for this investigation).

It should be noted that the differences between the QEMSCAN (calculated) and assay data for the Ni 
can be attributed to several factors including: 
- Uncertainty in the Ni:Fe ratio of pentlandite/violarite/millerite species 
- Uncertainty in Ni content of Ni alteration products (i.e. 'Other Ni minerals/boundaries') and 
- Uncertainty in Ni content of serpentine 
- Unsized nature of samples which can lead to some density segregation during sample 
preparation 
 
In copper mineralisation, chalcopyrite is the main copper host, and combined with the much less 
abundant bornite in ‘chalcopyrite/bornite’, accounts for about 85% of the copper in concentrates. The 
remainder of the copper is contributed by copper sulphides (i.e. chalcocite/digenite/covellite group) 
and various secondary copper phases which appear to include oxides, hydroxides, carbonates and/or 
silicates and which have also not been fully characterised for this study (more details in Table 10). 21 | P a g e

The sulphides are incompletely liberated from chromite and from the other gangue minerals. This is 
reflected in the low abundance of sulphides in the flotation concentrates (Table 11). Pyrite and

Table 12 shows the PGM locking class in concentrate and tails. The platinum group minerals (PGMs) 
have been classified into two main groups, which are present in similar proportions. The first group, 
having Pt as the main platinum group element, is apparently exclusively made up of sperrylite (PtAs 2) 
while the second group comprises PGMs having Pd as the main platinum group element. The Pd group 
is made up of a large number of phases of which can be sub-classified into three broad types which 
are, in approximate order of abundance: 
- Pd-Sb phases dominated by stibiopalladinite (Pd 5Sb2) with less ungavaite (Pd 4Sb3); 
- Pd-Te-Bi phases having a wide range in Te/Bi ratios and possibly including michenerite (PdBiTe), 
merenskyite (Pd(Te,Bi) 2), kotulskite (Pd(Te,Bi)) and/or telluropalladinite (Pd 9Te4) 
- Pd-Sb-Te -(Bi) phases dominated by testibiopalladite (PdTe(Sb,Te)).

The mineralogical investigation (Table 12) indicates that although the degree of liberation of the PGMs 
is similar to that of the sulphide minerals, a proportion of the PGM remains locked in the gangue 
minerals and in particular in chromite-rich particles, silicate-rich particles and composite chromite-
silicate-rich particles. The PGMs do not appear to be very strongly associated with the sulphide 
minerals although it is expected that increased milling of the flotation feed would increase the 
liberation (and therefore recovery) of both sulphides and PGMs.  24 | P a g e  
  
3.1.3.  Summary of flotation  
Flotation test work was conducted to assess the amenability of the oxidised PGMs ore to flotation. A 
number of flotation scouting tests were conducted to evaluate the impact of various reagent 
combinations. The best results from the flotation regimes which have been investigated are 
summarized below: 
a) Pulp conditioned with SENMIN reagents (400 g/t Sendep30E as a depressant, 200 g/t Senkol8 
as a primary collector, and 60 g/t Senfroth38 as a frother) and 200 g/t SIBX as a co-collector: 
In the best condition, rougher and scavenger flotation for 21 minutes generated a concentrate 
with ~80% recovery in~21% mass pull and PGMs grade of 25 g/t.  
b) Pulp conditioned with sodium dithionite as a sulphidisation reagent and flotation with Cytec 
reagents (36 g/t AP3418 and 36 g/t A3477) as a promoter, 50 g/t copper sulphate as an 
activator, 40 g/t MIBC as a frother, 200 g/t SIPX as a primary collector: Results show a better 
performance in terms of the mass pull and grade. In the best condition at P80=30µm, rougher 
and scavenger flotation generated a concentrate with ~80% recovery in ~5% mass pull and 
PGMs grade of 120 g/t. 
 
Furthermore, a mineralogical investigation revealed that the PGMs do not appear to be very strongly 
associated with the sulphide minerals. It is expected that increased milling of the flotation feed would 
increase the liberation and therefore recovery of both sulphides and PGMs.  
The test work results indicated that sulphidisation and employment of Cytec reagents (A3477 and 
AP3418) improved the flotation performance of the PGMs.  Based on the results, the author 
recommends below process for recovery of PGMs into a flotation concentrate. A proposed flowsheet 
is illustrated in Figure 9. 25 | P a g e

 The process would require the ore to be milled to P80% ~30μm followed by a rougher and two stages 
of scavenger flotation. 
 
3.2. Hydrometallurgical Process es result 
3.2.1.  Sulfuric acid bake process  
The roasting stage in the ‘’Panton process’’ was localized as a strategic entry point for inducing 
transformations to the sperrylite refractory structure. This part of the project (published paper II: 
Mpinga et al., 2017 ) determines whether the introduction of a sulfation roast pre-treatment step 
(instead of conventional oxidation roasting) to break down the crystal lattices, thereby rendering 
copper and nickel-containing phases amenable to water leaching, would result in their recoveries and 
simultaneously concentrate platinum metals in a solid residue. Chapter III of MPinga PhD Thesis 
presents findings of preliminary sulfation bake tests, outlining the effect of roasting temperature on 
PtAs 2 oxidation behaviour. 
However, the mineralogical characterization unfortunately still identified the presence of sperrylite in 
the water leach residues following the roast at 550°C, which is the highest temperature in the ‘’Panton 
process’’ mentioned by Lewins and Greenaway (2004). Whereas any pretreatment option should 
include a feasible strategy to further extract PGMs, the roasting process requires high temperatures 
to break down or decompose the crystal lattices to fully expose them to an appropriate leaching 
reagent. This observation paved the way for the next Chapter i.e. published paper III: Mpinga et al., 
2018a.  
A higher roast temperature of 650°C was investigated in this part of the project to ensure sperrylite 
would decompose. This was based on the assumption that increasing the roast temperature above 
the As-Pt eutectic of 597°C (Okamoto, 1990), would enable the arsenic to be released. Its 
concentration in the calcined ore was reduced from 185 g/t to less than 0.5 g/t. The mineralogical 
examination confirmed sperrylite had decomposed. 
Base metals beneficiation by sulfation roast was in principle straightforward (Mpinga et al., 2018a, 
2017). The results showed that the extent and rate of Cu extraction were higher than Ni, reaching 85% 
within 30 minutes. The use of acidified water facilitated almost complete Cu extraction. Nickel 
dissolution, on the other hand, reached 92.1% after 24 hours. However, the difficulty lay in further 
processing of this first-stage leach residue for PGM dissolution. This residue was further leached in 
sulfuric acid with thiocyanate at 50 and 85°C in the presence and absence of iodide as a catalyst. Pt in 
all cases failed to leach (< 0.2%) and less than 40% of the Pd was extracted. 
No matter the temperature, the extraction of palladium quickly plateaued after 4 hours and lower 
extraction was observed in the presence of iodide. This poor performance was attributed to additional 27 | P a g e  
 iron dissolution in the second leach (~45%) which is likely to have precipitated as the iron hydroxy-
sulfate jarosite (Broadhurst and Du Perez, 1993) and would possibly passivate the surface. According 
to Dutrizac (1983), jarosite-type compounds have the ability to precipitate iron from acidic leach 
solutions.  
The actual reason for the mixed ligand system performing poorly is unclear and requires further 
investigation. Therefore the H 2SO 4-SCN(I) leach approach was found not fit-for-purpose. As elaborated 
in Chapter V (published paper IV: Mpinga et al., 2018b), thiocyanate usage should be restricted to 
PGM adsorption processes rather than ore leaching. 
 
3.2.2.  Molten salts chlorination   
During the course of 2019, a chlorination roast followed by an HCl leach was conducted on a PGM 
flotation concentrate to investigate the extraction of PGMs. Mixtures of CaCl 2 and MgCl 2 were added 
to the concentrate (ratio of total salts to concentrate 2:1, 3:1 and 4:1) and roasted at 650 °C for 6hr . 
After roasting, the residues were leached in 6M hydrochloric acid at 95 °C for 24 hr.  The salt roasting 
experiments were performed on a flotation concentrate that contained 101 g/t Pt, 106 g/t Pd and 9.41 
g/t gold. HCl leaching was undertaken on the roast residue in order to assess the influence of roasting 
on PGMs leachability. 
Figures 11 and 12 show the kinetic curves for Pt, Pd and Au extraction. It can be seen that by increasing 
the salt to concentrate ratio (mixture of CaCl 2 and MgCl 2) more platinum was extracted. For instance 
platinum extraction increased from 70% to 78% as the ratio of total salts to concentrate increased 
from 3:1 to 4:1. Palladium extractions were in a similar range at 97 and 95%, as the ratio of total salts 
to concentrate increased from 3:1 to 4:1, respectively.  
The optimum results indicated that the process can extract almost all the PGMs in the concentrate 
(80% Pt, 95% Pd and 95% Au). The effect of chloride salts has been demonstrated, the process require s 
a very high ratio of 4:1 salts to concentrate to extract all the PGMs (80 kg/t ore CaCl 2 and 80 kg/t 
MgCl 2). Another important issue is that the salt roasting process generates chloride gas which is very 
corrosive.  28 | P a g e

3.2.3.  Conventional roasting followed by HCl/NaCl/H 2O2 leaching  
During the course of 2019, a new leaching method was developed to process the flotation concentrate 
by conventional roasting followed by HCl/NaCl/H 2O2 leaching. The results show almost all the PGMs 
were leached. In this leaching system, Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was taken as the oxidizing 
agent, hydrochloric acid (HCl) was taken as the leaching agent and sodium chloride (NaCl) was 
employed to provide Cl− for PGM complexing.  
29 | P a g e  
 Conventional roasting (650oC for 6hr) followed by a mixture of HCl/NaCl + H 2O2 leach test work was 
conducted on a flotation concentrate to evaluate the amenability of the concentrate to roasting and 
HCl leaching. In this leaching system, Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was taken as the oxidizing 
agent, hydrochloric acid (6M HCl at 95oC) was taken as the leaching agent and sodium chloride (NaCl) 
was employed to provide Cl− for PGMs complexing. It can be seen (Figure 13) that the process 
extracted almost all the PGMs (97% Pt, 90% Pd and 97% Au) in the concentrate.  Figure 13 shows the 
kinetic curve for PGMs extraction with 21 kg sodium chloride, 40 kg HCl and 5 kg hydrogen peroxide 
per tonne of ore was added during leaching.  
The results show that increasing the solid percentage up to 25% didn’t affect the extraction 
percentage and most of the PGMs were extracted (97% Pt, 90% P d and 97% Au) .  
 
Figure 13. Conventional roasting (6h@650oC) followed by HCl/NaCl/H 2O2 leaching  
Furthermore, the precipitation process conducted on the leach solution shows a good separation of 
PGMs and base metals from gangue metals like iron/aluminium (Table 13). The precipitation process 
consists of three stages: (1) PGM precipitation with NaHS or CuS to produce a concentrate containing 
the PGMs, (2) Acid, Iron and Aluminium removal by increasing the pH to ~1 to 2 by adding slurry 
30 | P a g e  
 containing 25% w/w CaCO 3 at 80oC for 2 hours and stage (3) Mixed hydroxide precipitation (Ni/Cu/Co) 
by adding slurry containing 20% w/w MgO to reach pH of 8.0 at 50oC for 1hr to produce a concentrate 
that contains a mixed hydroxide precipitate of nickel, copper and cobalt.

Based on the results, the author recommends conventional roasting followed by HCl/NaCl/H 2O2

metallurgical test work.  31 | P a g e

4. Conclusion  
Flotation test work was conducted to assess the amenability of the Panton Sill oxidised PGM ore to 
flotation. The best result from the flotation is summarized below: 
a) Pulp conditioned with sodium dithionite as a sulphidisation reagent and flotation with Cytec 
reagents (36 g/t AP3418 and 36 g/t A3477) as a promoter, 50 g/t copper sulphate as an 
activator, 40 g/t MIBC as a frother, 200 g/t SIPX as a primary collector. At P80=30µm, rougher 
and scavenger flotation generated a concentrate with ~80% recovery in ~5% mass pull and 
PGM grade of 120 g/t. 
In terms of a hydrometallurgical process, conventional roasting (650oC for 6hr) followed by HCl/NaCl 
+ H 2O2 leach test work shows a better performance in terms of extraction percentage, operating cost 
and technical ability of the process. This method extracts almost all the PGMs (97% Pt, 90% Pd a nd 
97% Au) from the flotation concentrate.  
Furthermore, the precipitation process conducted on the leach solution shows a good separation of 
PGMs and base metals from other gangue metals like iron/aluminium. The precipitation process 
consists of three stages: (1) PGM precipitation with NaHS or CuS to produce a concentrate containing 
the PGMs, (2) Acid, Iron and Aluminium removal by increasing the pH to ~1 to 2 by adding a slurry 
containing 25% w/w CaCO 3 at 90oC for 2 hours and stage (3) mixed hydroxide precipitation (Ni/Cu/Co) 
by adding a slurry containing 20% w/w MgO to reach a pH of 8.0 at 90oC for 1h and producing a 
concentrate containing mixed hydroxide precipitate s of nickel, copper and cobalt.     
While a large quantity of test work has been completed, it must be remembered neither the flotation 
nor hydrometallurgical process has been completely optimised. Based on the results, the author 
recommends flowsheets in Figure 10 and 14 be optimised to extract the PGMs from the flotation 
concentrate. The proposed process has been prepared to incorporate the key metallurgical design 
criteria derived from the results of the metallurgical test work.  
 
  33 | P a g e  
 5. Potential cost reductions for the hydrometallurgical process  
One significant benefit from replacing the mixed salt (CaCl 2 and MgCl 2) roast by conventional roasting 
is the reduced costs of not using the mixed salt reagents. There will be some cost from including NaCl 
but NaCl is relatively cheap. With this in mind, there is scope to investigate other potential cost savings . 
The following list is a good starting point:- 
 Investigate if leaching will work without roasting? 
 If roasting is required, can it be further optimised? Temperature, length of roast, etc? 
 For the leaching process investigate alternative cheaper reagents 
o Replace HCl with H 2SO 4. 
o Replace H 2O2 with O 2/Air. 
 Investigate improving the precipitate grades? 
 
6. Status of concentrates to be produced from the PGM precipitation stage  
The precipitation process as outlined produces a mixed concentrate containing the PGMs which will 
be sold to a precious metal refinery. 
It has been suggested that the PGM precipitation process be modified to incorporate separate 
precipitation stages to produce three separate concentrates. These three concentrates can then be 
refined at site to produce separate unrefined metals of platinum, palladium and gold, similar to a gold 
plant producing unrefined bars of gold ore . Producing separate metals as final products will enhance 
the economics of the project.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Panton Sill deposit in the Kimberley region of Western Australia is only one of a 
few Platinum Group Metal (PGM) deposits in Australia. The deposit has a declared 
resource of 14.32 million tonnes at 2.19g/t Pt, 2.39g/t Pd, 0.31g/t Au (~2Moz contained 
Pt+Pd). The remoteness of the site, the size of the deposit, and the challenges to produce 
high grade-low chromite flotation concentrates suitable for smelting, has initiated 
research into hydrometallurgical extraction options as processing alternatives. Earlier 
research which was patented by Bax et al. (2009), identified a process using calcining 
of the concentrates followed by cyanidation leaching and ion exchange. Lonmin Plc was 
the patent holder at the time. However, environmental sensitivities made the intensive use of 
(sodium) cyanide in the Kimberley region unacceptable. This necessitated a search for 
alternative metallurgical approaches. Mpinga et al. (2015) reviewed a number of 
alternative processing options, identifying acidic thiocyanate leaching and alkaline glycine 
leaching (as patented by Eksteen and Oraby (2014, 2015)) as potential alternative options 
for the direct leaching of the Panton Sill ore. From an economic perspective, it is important 
to find a suitable lixiviant for all the PGM’s and precious metals (gold). Whilst palladium 
and gold were found to be less problematic for most lixiviants, irrespective 
mineralisation typical of PGM ores, platinum minerals have been found to be much more 
refractory, if not thermally treated. In particular, sperrylite (PtAs 2) has been found to be 
particularly refractory to direct leach approaches. 
Sperrylite is the dominant Pt-bearing mineral in the PGM-enriched chromitites occurring 
mainly in the chalcopyrite of the nickel-copper ores and accounting for about 55.31% of the 
maximum amount of extractable Pt — has been identified as a slow-leaching mineral 
(limiting-step) in cyanide, especially in comparison with the Au and Pd minerals (Mwase et 
al., 2012; Eksteen et al., 2012; Lewins and Greenaway, 2004). Whilst the leaching of all the 
PGM’s are of importance, it is crucial from a financial feasibility perspective that a suitable 
lixiviant be found that can leach sperrylite (given that the other minerals will dissolve faster).   
Mpinga (2015) has shown in his review on the use of acidic thiocyanate systems that the 
effects of salt additives, mechanical activation and redox potential control upon processes 
chemistry were emphasized. Oxygen injection at supersonic velocity to produce nano-sized 
bubbles to overcome the ferric regeneration inefficiency by oxygen/air use in atmospheric 
processing was also highlighted. This has paved the way for the current investigation. Its 
objective is to investigate various recovery options and operating variables in order that the 
flowsheet options can be assessed for technical feasibility and economic viability. This report 
serves as an initial progress report early in the project life and therefore should be seen as 
work in progress and not as final conclusions.  MRIWA Project M0458

1. INTRODUCTION
Finding a suitable lixiviant that is economically and environme ntally feasible for the Panton
Sill PGM deposit invariably points to finding suitable leaching  conditions that would optimise
dissolution of the ore’s most refractory PGM minerals, if these  minerals are present as
predominant forms of PGM mineralisation. Given the ratio of the  prices of Pt to Pd (USD 960
for Pt to USD 565 for Pd), it is important to achieve a high recovery of Pt to make the project
economically viable.
The logical sequence of diagnostic analysis is as follows: 
a. Characterise the assay and mineralogy of the ores.
b. Quantify and qualify the associations and liberation.
c. Identify the PGM minerals that are rate limiting with regard  to leaching and their
overall contribution to PGM deportment.
d.Identify the chemical and electrochemical conditions that ma y optimise the leaching
of the rate limiting minerals (most refractory)
Mineralogical reports to date have indicated that platinum is p redominantly mineralised as 
sperrylite, which was also confirmed by our own mineralogical c haracterisation. Sperrylite 
(PtAs 2) is the most abundant PGM mineral in many primary platinum ore  deposits, and is 
also one of the most refractory to hydrometallurgical processing. It is insoluble in mineral 
acids (O'Neill and Gunning, 1934), in aqua regia (Gowing and Po tts, 1991; Hall and Bonham-
Carter, 1988) and leaches only slowly in alkaline cyanide solut ions (Mwase et al., 2014). On 
the other hand, sperrylite tends to be lost to tails during the over-grinding because of the 
mineral’s brittleness and its different flotation response (Cole and Ferron, 2002). Thereby high mass pulls of around 4 to 6% (as compared to the usual 2%) are required to achieve 
acceptable grade recoveries of PGMs (Mwase et al., 2014), often leading to poor 
concentrate grades. PGMs are mainly extracted by pyrometallurgi cal technologies (Mpinga 
et al., 2015). However, the remoteness of sites, the nature and proportion of contaminants (such as chromite) and the depletion of ore deposits and declin ing mineral grades encourage 
the development of hydrometallurgic al processes for its recover y. 
To study the leaching behaviour of sperrylite, pure sperrylite crystals were obtained from 
gravity concentrates from the Sudbury basin (to source sufficient amounts for evaluation). As leaching is an oxidative process at different pH’s, it is ideal ly studied as an electrochemical 
process, which will enable the researchers to understand what m echanisms can be either 
enhanced or suppressed in order to accelerate leaching and incr ease the overall leachability. MRIWA Project M0458

It should be emphasised that in the original project plan, the researchers would have 
executed their research using flotation concentrates from the P anton Sill deposit, as 
produced by the Panoramic Resources team looking into optimisation of the grinding and 
flotation of the ore. These c oncentrates (which was dependent o n being produced by another 
testwork institution) were not delivered, but the ore was deliv ered in two drums. The work 
was subsequently split into the following stages: 
a. Reviewing the literature for direct leach approaches of PGM deposits.
b.Qualifying and quantifying the mineralogy of the ore samples  received.
c.Obtaining high grade sperrylite crystals and high grade sperrylite concentrates.
d.Performing leaching and electrochemical studies of sperrylite crystals in differe nt
leaching environments.
e. Extending the leach conditions to milled/ground ores.
Data from the recent electrochemical studies by Mpinga et al. ( 2016) indicated that alkaline 
leaching was the best approach for oxidative pre-treatment of sperrylite as it promotes 
arsenic oxidation at relatively low potentials with a rate prop ortional to the applied voltages. 
The leaching of sperrylite is believed to proceed according to the two-phase dissolution mechanism in which mineral dissolution is facilitated through a rsenic oxidation (Equation 1), 
followed by a secondary (oxidizing) leach to oxidize the platin um to Pt(II) state (Equation 2). 
Theoretically the secondary oxidizing leach has to be carried o ut at high redox potential (> 
1,200 mV
SHE) by using strong oxidant such as hydrogen peroxide illustrated simplistically in 
Equation 3. Besides its high oxidizing power, the presence of h ydrogen peroxide is also an 
alternative oxygen source, which is an advantage when the concentration of total dissolved oxygen is of concern.

Inorganic ar
senic comprises two oxyanions including arsenite As (III) and arsenate As(V). 
The former is unstable under oxidizing conditions and is readil y oxidized to As(V). Moreover, 
it is about 60 times more toxic than the oxidized pentavalent state (Rajaković et al., 2013). Redox potential (Eh) and solution pH are the most important factors controlling As 
speciation. Wang et al. (2009) have observed that H
3AsO 4 and AsO3
4species are present 
under extremely acidic and alkaline conditions, respectively. A ccording to Van Herreweghe 
et al. (2002), arsenic displays an increased solubility at high  solution pH. As(V) is less 
soluble and it is adsorbed more efficiently than As(III) under acidic conditions (Larios et al., MRIWA Project M0458	
4	
2012). This is consistent with the most preferred form for arse nic disposal as a scorodite 
product (FeAsO 4·2H 2O). 
Referring to the requirement of high oxidation-reduction potent ial, it is noteworthy that the 
mixture of concentrated hydrogen peroxide and concentrated sulp huric acid in the 0.33 to 
0.66 mole ratio forms Caro’s acid (H 2SO 5), which is a strong oxidizing agent with an E o of 
around 1,850 mV SHE. Moreover, Fenton’s reagent or Fenton’s process developed in the 
1890s by Henry John Horstman Fenton consisting of a homogeneous  solution of hydrogen 
peroxide and transition metal ions such as Fe3+ o r  C u2+ produces free hydroxyl radicals 
during the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (Equati on 4) in acidic 
media (Sanabria et al., 2012).  
The hydroxyl radical (HO) is a powerful, non-selective chemical oxidant with an oxidati on 
potential of 2,590 mV SHE at pH 0, and 1,640 mV SHE at pH of 14. Thereby, SCN is readily 
oxidized to sulphate, carbonate and ammonium, so that a marked loss of the reagent would 
be expected even in the presence of Fe3+ (E = 770 mV SHE). Furthermore, it has been shown 
that the reaction of H 2O2 with SCN(Equation 5) can generate HCN (Botz et al., 2001).  
Mn+ +  H 2O2   →   M(n+1)+ +  HO− +  HO   (4) 
3 H 2O2    +   SCN           SO2
4 +  HCN  +  H +  2 H 2O         (5) 
In alkaline leaching process on the other hand, Fe3+ ion does not play a role in any oxidation 
process as it is not present above the solution pH of 3.5 (Bali ntova and Petrilakova, 2011). 
However, it has been shown that ferrite anions, FeO2, are formed at sufficiently high pH, 
w h i l e  f e r r a t e  ( F e O24) ions predominate in the high pH and high Eh regions (Hem and 
Cropper, 1959). Noorhasan et al. (2010) carried out studies on glycine oxidation by Fe(VI) in 
alkaline medium. They found that acetate, carbon dioxide, ammon ia and nitrogen were the 
oxidation products at solution pH of 9. Xiao et al. (2002) studied the adsorption of glycine, 
serine and threonine on polycrystalline Pt and Au electrodes in  alkaline media. They 
established that these amino acids dissociate on the Pt surfaces to form a cyanide adlayer. 
Skrypnikova et al. (2008) reported that glycine oxidation process was possible at high 
potentials Е > 800 mV SHE due to the catalytic influence of Cu(II) oxide. Similar to aci dic 
media, the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in alkaline solut ions is also catalysed by 
compounds of heavy metals (e.g. Cu2+, Fe3+, Mn3+) present as trace impurities (Špalek et al., 
1982). Table 1 provides a summary of some key radicals and reactive intermediates thought to play a major role in catalyzed hydrogen peroxide systems.  MRIWA Project M0458

Thus using high purity 
sperrylite, the purpose of this study wa s twofold: 1) to ascertain with a 
greater degree of insight previous electrochemical observations  underlying sperrylite 
oxidation mechanism and 2) to compile a reference of standard l eaching methods of 
sperrylite prior to examining approaches of treating low-grade platiniferous materials. 
Consequently, the study was undertaken to assess acid/alkaline leaching in the presence 
and absence of hydrogen peroxide as a pre-treatment process dur ing/or prior to 
thiocyanate/glycine leaching.  
2. EXPERIMENTAL
The early part of the project is about materials characterisati on, methods development and
verification and exploratory tests. Research on ore and sperryl ite are happening in parallel.
2.1. Materials 
2.1.1. Panton ore receipt and preparation 
Even though not used in this study, the feed material for the b atch leaching test programme 
had been collected (two drums) in relatively coarse grind size ranging from minus 710 µm to 
plus 2.8 mm. The choice of working material (Drum 2) was made m ainly on the basis of its 
high platinum, palladium and chromium contents. Table 1 display s its head grade and 
mineralogical composition obtained through TIMA-Tescan (compara ble to QEMSCAN) and 
fire assay analyses. Its mineralogical composition was essentia lly chromite (78.12%) with 
small amount of sperrylite representing 0.02% of the total plat inum found. Although not MRIWA Project M0458

detected by Tescan, it was assumed that palladium antimonide wa s the main palladium 
phase. Copper (0.0646%) was contained in the minerals cuprite ( Cu2O), lautite (CuAsS) and 
bornite (Cu 5FeS 4). Pentlandite was detected to be around 1.51%. The analysis also showed 
the preponderance of siliceous and carbonates gangue in the ore . The minerals locking 
sperrylite in the ore (Drum 2) are depicted in Figure 1.

In order to liberate the PGM minerals, Jones (2005) and Vermaak  (1995) noticed that UG-2 
concentrate (with average grain size of about 15 µm) was more f inely milled to about 80% 
less than 75 µm, while the Merensky concentrate (average grain size of about 45 µm) to 
around 55% of less than 75 µm. The average grain size of the ore under investigation was 
found to be around 9 µm.  
The sample (Drum 2) was thoroughly blended and split into eight  test work charges — of 17 
to 18 kg each — using a laboratory rotary riffle splitter. Then  each charge was subjected to 
additional particle size reduction (P 80 ˂ 75 µm) using a laboratory-size ring mill and afterward 
was kept in sealed fresh plastic bag container — isolated from air effect — and stored in a 
freezer until required. Particle size distributions (PSD) by we t screening using a laser 
diffraction sulphide (Malvern Mastersizer 2000) are depicted in  Figure 2. The P 80 size of the 
particle fed to the leach was around 64 μm.

leach experiments 
2.1.2. High purity sperry lite
 
High purity PtAs 2 crystals served as a proxy material to determine first-hand th e rate and 
extent of platinum dissolution in complexing acid/alkaline thiocyanate/glycine media prior to examining methods of treating low-grade platinum containing mat erials e.g. in Table 2. 
Table 3 displays the head grade and mineralogical composition obtained through Tescan analysis of the high purity feed material. It can be seen that the material has no chromium 
content and has insignificant amounts of both iron and copper.  020406080100

2.2. Leaching equipment 
The batch r
eactor used in this work was a 1500 mL (working volu me) double jacketed glass 
reactor provided with a tapering conical bottom — 100 mm interi or diameter, 243 mm in 
height — fitted with four attached baffles and water inlet/outlet connected to a thermostat 
controlled water bath. The conical configuration facilitates go od mixing. The flow pattern 
gives adequate solid suspension . Singh et al. (2011) argued tha t reactors with conical bottom 
have satisfactory flow pattern owing to very low off bottom clearance of the impeller.  
The vessel had openings — in the lid — to introduce a dispersion tube for oxygen, pH 
electrode, to withdraw solution samples, and a central opening to fix an anchor propeller 
stirrer for mixing the solution. The reactor was also equipped with a mercury thermometer 
and a cooling reflux condenser that allows continuous return of  volatile materials to the 
reaction mixture reducing evaporation losses as oxygen (99% purity) was bubbled throughout the experiments. To maintain the water balance, evap oration losses were 
compensated by adding distilled water and adjusting the slurry pH accordingly before 
sampling. All open ports on the lid were plugged with rubber stoppers to seal the reactor.  
2.3. Leaching solutions 
Reagent grade sodium thiocyanate (≥ 98%) and glycine (≥ 99%) bo th from Sigma Aldrich 
(used without further purification) were dissolved in distilled  water to make up the test 
solutions. Sodium hydroxide and sulphuric acid were used to man ually adjust or maintain the 
pH at set points.  MRIWA Project M0458	
11	
2.4. Procedures 
Except where mentioned, the chemical leaching tests were carried out using 1000 mL of 
specific leaching solution of known pH, thiocyanate, glycine or other additive concentrations. 
Once the desired temperature w as reached, an accurately weighed  amount of solids (1 g i.e., 
solid concentration of 0.1%w/v) with particle size P 80 of < 75 μm was added into the reactor, 
and then the time began to be measured. As the leaching reactor  was a gas-sparged 
agitated vessel, oxygen was continuously fed into the slurry at  500 mL/minute. The agitation 
was provided by an overhead stirrer driven at the constant spee d of 600 rpm to ensure full 
suspension of solids. Thiocyanate or glycine was added — when required — to the reaction 
system at start or following 6 hours hydrogen peroxide preoxida tion. 
The leaching time was extended to 96 hours, in order to unravel  its effect on the reaction 
mixture. Aliquots of 5 mL collected through 0.45 µm pore size syringe filters — to prevent further reaction with the leached material which may have been carried over from the 
process — were taken at specific timed intervals, analysed for dissolved metals by ICP-MS 
and gross reagent consumption by HPLC analysis. The leach resid ues were washed 
thoroughly several times with di stilled water to remove any phy sically attached ions or any 
unreacted ligands (reagents), and then filtered under vacuum using Whatman N
o 1 paper, 
dried at 50°C for 72 hours, and kept until required. 
3. RESULTSWe were still waiting upon solid assays to reconcile back to th e head assays. Once the
assay results are obtained these will be reported, in addition to results from extended leach
tests. A few aspects need further consideration:
a. Should high recoveries of PGM’s be achieved into a fairly sm all mass pull of flotation
concentrate, it is preferable that the future work focusses on flotation concentrate
rather than bulk ore.
b. Should flotation recovery prove feasible, it may be sensible to heat treat the
concentrate to 400 C which is expected to break down the sperrylite and allow for
faster leaching of the residual PGMs, particularly if the histo ric research by Platinum
Australia is taken into account where the concentrate was calcined at low
temperature prior to leaching (cyanidation in the original case ). Heat treatment (not
roasting as no significant oxidation is required) can decompose the structure of boththe sperrylite as well as the chlorite gangue (it will not chan ge the chromite).MRIWA Project M0458

4. CONCLUSIONS
Initial indications are that even though sperrylite does react with both acidic thiocyanate and
alkaline glycine, the reaction rates are slow. Permission is re quested to evaluate the role of
thermal treatment on ore and concentrate. The research in the c oming months will focus on
conditions that would optimise sperrylite dissolution.

Leaching tests on PGM -chromite rich ore  
   Panton project  — Progres s report 2     2 
1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Panoramic Resources Plc. is investigating the possibility of extracting Cu, Ni, Pt and Pd 
from its chromite rich ore body situated in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. It was
proposed through Panton process (Lewins and Greenaway, 2004) their recovery via
a lengthy metallurgical pattern
 including Calcination — Cyanide leach — Low pH 
precipitation and —Acid pressure leach . However, the overall process suffers from some 
shortcomings such as long leaching time (slow leaching rate), unexplained precipitation and 
redissolution steps, large reagents consumption, loss of platinum to tailings and an 
inherently a complex flowsheet.
This report 
covers preliminary leaching experiments of Panton ore sample carried out by 
Gold Technology
 Group at WASM. Leaching tests were performed on raw and/or roasted 
ore to determine feas
ible means of extracting copper and nickel values (the latter being 
the 
most valuable base metal) and simultaneously concentrating platinum metals in a 
solid residue. PGMs were then recovered into solution from the roaster calcine. Sulfation 
roasting followed by water leach and a subsequent thiocyanate leach, and alkaline glycine 
leach process (with and without c yanide addition) were the two pre-treatment scenarios 
observed.  
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Refer to the draft paper: ‘’ Upgrading low -grade PGM chromite- rich ore with the recovery of
copper and nickel through sulfation roasting and water leaching’’.

3.1. SULFATION -ROASTING -WATER LEACH  PROCESS  
As the proposed leach process for platinum group metals is acidic (using acidic thiocyanate), 
it would be beneficial and sensible to perform the base metal extraction/removal also in an acidic reaction environment. A fractional factorial design investigati ng the levels of H
2SO 4 
(sulfating agent), Na2SO 4 (catalyst) , roasting temperature, roasting time, leaching temperature, 
oxygen addition at the leaching stage and leaching duration on the dissolution efficiency of various metals including copper, nickel, iron, chromium and PGMs was conducted.  The 
individual levels for the seven input factors are shown in Table 2.

p-valu
es were used to determine the significance of each main effect and interactions among
variables. Generally, a term that has a probability value less than or equal to 0.05 would be considered as significant effect at a confidence level of ≥ 95%, other wise it is regarded as not
significant. 
Inter
actions (factors) with negative influence (coefficient) indicate that these are interactions 
(factors) that reduce efficacy of the roasting and/or leaching process (antagonistic effect). Similarly, interaction s (factors) with positive influence indicate that these are interactions 
(factors) that increase efficacy of the process (synergistic effect).  
3.1.1
. Sulfation -roasting stage  
3.1.1.1. Effect of roasting duration on water- soluble species formation  
The roasting duration exhibited an adverse effect on Cr, Cu and Ni extraction in the decreasing 
order: Cr  > Cu > Ni. The results reveal that their recovery decreased with the rise in both 
roasting time and temperature.  This may be due to the increasing amount of sulfates that are 
decomposed (low decomposition temperature) to oxysulfates and oxides which are insoluble in water. So long exposure at high temperatures (≥  550°C) would be beneficial only to theLeaching tests on PGM -chromite rich ore

unwanted chromium impurity as it undergo the oxidation process.  Pt, Pd and Fe were not 
statistically affected.  
3.1.1.
2. Effect of H 2SO 4 addition on water -soluble species formation  
Except for copper extraction (not statistically affected), H 2SO 4 addition had a synergistic  effect 
on other responses in the decreasing order Ni > Pd > Cr > Fe > Pt; i.e. their extraction increase 
with H 2SO 4 increase. Apparently, nickel dissolution outpaces that of copper, which is probably 
due to the easier decomposition of the nickel phases: pentlandite and rammelsbergite.  
It 
should be noted that H 2SO 4 addition was the most influential factor among all others. Its 
influence has been highly involved in almost all recorded interactions either synergic or antagonistic. The advantage of the sulfation roasting- leaching process is that the pH of the 
final leach solution was about 2, which is beneficial for downstream recovery processing of 
base metals . This significantly reduces neutralization costs as currently practiced in HPAL.  In 
addition, s uch possibility of acid regeneration implies low acid consumption.  
3.1.1.3. 
Effect of Na 2SO 4 addition on water -soluble species formation  
Na2SO 4 addition has a negative effect on copper extraction, but positively affected chromium 
and platinum extraction (Cr > Pt). Its effect on Ni, Fe and Pd extraction was not statistically significant. Note that w hile u sing Na
2SO 3, Zhao et al. (2015) could not improve copper sulfation 
when the roasting temperature was below 550˚C. Basturkcu and Acarkan (2016) also stated
that the catalytic activity of Na 2SO 4 depends on its dosage and reaction temperature.  
In addi
tion, the eutectic  in the NiSO 4-Na2SO 4 system is at approximately 670°C (Yu et al., 
2014) which is above the current roasting temperature. This may explain the inefficacity of Na
2SO 4. Thereby its use (≈  76.92  kg/t ore) may be discontinued as it is not directly playing its
catalytic role of sulfating nickel. The extraction of nickel without Na 2SO 4 addition was found to 
be 87.1% within 24 hours leach. It should also note the decrease in H 2SO 4 addition from 462 
to 428.57 kg/t ore.  
3.1.1.4. 
Effect of roasting temperature on water -soluble species formation 
Roasting temperature is one of key factors to consider during sulfation roasting. It exhibited an adverse effect on Fe, Cr and Cu extraction in the decreasing order: Fe > Cr > Cu. The decrease of copper extraction is not consistent with the higher decomposition temperature of copper sulfates which is in the 650 to 700°C temperature range. The decline may be attributed to the 
partial decomposition of its corresponding sulfates at higher temperatures (Guo et al., 2009).  Leaching tests on PGM -chromite rich ore  
                    Panton project  — Progress report 2                    6 
Kshum aneva et al. (2014) also observed that the sulfation of a Co- Ni thiospinels concentrate 
with concentrated H 2SO 4 could occur at temperatures of 96 to 240°C  (Lower than that in this 
work).  The temperature effect on Ni, Pt and Pd was not statistically significant. Therefore, an 
optimum roasting temperature need to be determined as this will lead to a sharp drop in the 
extraction of water -soluble iron and chromium, which is beneficial for downstream treatments.  
 3.1.2. Water leach stage of above calcine roaster  
3.1.2.1. Effect of leaching duration on water -soluble species formation 
Figure 1 shows that after 24 hours, 90 % nickel extraction was achieved. Further increase in 
time does not affect its extraction; on the contrary, it may lead to the leaching of unwanted 
elements . As a result, a contact time of 2 4 hours was selected as the effective leaching time .

addition (76.92 kg/t) ). Leaching conditions: distilled water, pulp density of 2%w/v, without oxygen 
addition, rotational rate of 600 rpm at 80°C  
 3.1.2.2. Effect of leaching temperature on water -soluble species formation  
Except for platinum extraction (effect statistically not significant), the leaching temperature had a positive effect on other responses in the decreasing order: Ni > Cu > Cr; i.e. their extraction increase with temperature increase. The increase in the temperature makes any  passivation 
layer less stable (Bahamòndez et al., 2016).  However, the leaching temperature has a 
negative effect on both Fe and Pd extraction (Fe > Pd). This behaviour may be due to several other reaction taking place with one or other intermediate products.

3.1.2.3. Effect of O 2 addition on water -soluble species formation 
Only iron extraction was negatively affected by oxygen addition. N o statistically significant 
effect was observed on the remaining responses. According to Stumm and Lee (1961) the 
reaction of Fe(II) with oxygen generally leads directly to ferric oxides or hydroxides. This may 
explain the negative effect observed.  
 3.1.2.4. PGMs recovery from first stage water  leach residue  
Figure 2 illustrates the degree of metal leaching as a function of time at 50°C in thiocyanate solution. Platinum and palladium species already oxidized tend to reprecipitate from the acidic 
thiocyanate solution if the reaction proceed longer than 24 hours  (for the conditions used in 
the leach). According to Iglesias and Carranza (1994), the presence of some intermediate species, such as ferrous iron, sul fide ion and arsenites, can consume vital oxygen for precious 
metals  dissolution . Furthermore , in order to stabilize these PGM  complexes, and to achieve 
acceptable leaching rates, it is necessary to employ far higher lixiviant concentrations  — 
usually 0.1 to 1 M — as suggested by Fleming  (1992). Note that t he spent lixiviant has to  be 
recycled.

3.2.1. Using unroasted raw ore 
Figure 3 illustrates the degree of metal leaching as a function of time at 50°C in alkaline glycine 
solution. Within 6 hours the extraction of both copper and nickel reached approximately 40 and  
45% respectively , indicating a relatively  high initial leaching rate. However, f urther time 
increase has no obvious improvement on extraction possibly due to a surface passivating 
layer.  It may also be inferred that metals dissolution was slower due to the low reagent 
concentration.

amount of platinum extracted. The reason for such a disparity remains speculative at this  time,

4. Characterisation of leach residues  
Mineralogical examination (Table 3) has indicated  that — in both acidic and alkaline processes  
— more than one -half of the calcines consisted of  chromite. This evidences on microscopic 
scale the fairly uniform chromite composition of the ore and does not vary significantly from 
one particle to another. The remainder was largely a mixture of chlorite – clinochlore and 
olivine . There wa s no pentlandite or chalcopyrite in the calcines.  However, t he most important 
mineralogical components identified in the alkaline leach residue were chalcopyrite and 
pentlandite.  
 
Mineralogical studies have also indicated that unleached platinum in all leach residues was 
sperrylite . Note that t he lowest melting temperature in the As -Pt system ( eutectic ) is at 
approximately 597°C (Okamoto, 1990), which is higher than Panton’s roasting temperature (550°C: also adopted in this work). T herefore, t emperatures of more than the  eutectic point are  
required to accelerate the  thermal decomposition of sperrylite . However,  no Pd mineral  was 
detected (Tescan) in either sample, although the ore  head sample contained 15.20 g/t .

5. CONCLUSION  
The first and most important conclusion that can be made is that nickel and copper c an 
effectively be leached from the low-grade PGM chromite- rich ore using sulfation- roasting -
leaching method. PGM head grade was upgraded (15.6% increase) from around 28 to 
32.38  g/tonne. The results demonstrated that within the parameters of the experiment, the 
amount of H2SO 4 addition was  the most influential factor  to control, whereas the effect of 
Na2SO 4 addition on Ni was not statistically significant  probably due to low temperature used. 
Actual tests resulted in 89.9 % Ni and 76.8% Cu extraction with 462 kg H 2SO 4 consumed /t ore . 
The extraction of nickel without Na 2SO 4 addition was found to be 87.1% within 24 hours leach 
and consumed 428 kg/t ore. 
 The low temperature leaching at atmospheric pressure involved saves considerable amount of energy thereby minimising operating costs.  While  unconcentrated ore was used in the 
roasting process, ideally t he technique can use a rougher flotation product  — a considerable 
amount of ore weight will be rejected — thus reducing separation costs and saving valuable 
minerals (e.g. sperrylite) that may be lost in making cleaner concentrate. Only a low percentage of chromium and iron (10.40 and 13.60% in the ore, respectively) accompanies copper and nickel as a water -soluble sulfate ( 0.80 and 1.46%, respectively).   
 The serpentine crystalline structure of the ore virtually determines copper and nickel attainable 
extraction by the first stage alkaline glycine leach . Temperatures of more than the As -Pt 
eutectic point (597°C)  may be required to accelerate the thermal decomposition of sperrylite. 
In order to stabilize precious metal  complexes in both acidic and alkaline solutions, and to 
achieve acceptable leaching rates, it is necessary to employ far higher lixiviant concentrations  (thiocyanate and/or glycine) .

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The Gold Technology Group at WASM has developed  a sequence of process  steps  for 
treating a PGM -bearing chromite ore at atmospheric conditions  in order to recover metal 
values contained therein. This report presents the results of an extensive sighter testwork 
performed in both acidic and alkaline media.  
 Acidic chloride, sulfuric acid and alkaline glycine leach systems were carried out in either 
single -stage or two- stage techniques. The  low-temperature, hybrid pyro- hydrometallurgical, 
single -stage solid salt chlorination process proved successful for simultaneously and 
efficiently leaching Cu, Ni, Pt and Pd without the need and/or addition of oxidizing agents.  
 Despite the use of somewhat  inadequate chlorination apparatus, cheap calcium and 
magnesium chlorides ( CaCl
2 and MgCl 2 respectively) produced promising results, i.e. 
75.59% Pt and 93.28% Pd leach extraction when the ore was roasted with  CaCl 2 at 650°C 
for 6  hours, and then slurried in 6 M HCl that mimic typical industrial concentration. Copper 
leaching was found to be slow and reached equilibrium (36.89%) in 30 minutes whereas for nickel, prolonged leaching time was needed to achieve 81.74% within 24 hours.  
 High recoveries of Pt (98.87%), Pd (73.52%), Cu (69.73%) and Ni (90.14%) were achieved within 24 hours leach by roasting the ore with MgCl
2 at 650°C for 6 hours; but with too much 
iron co- dissolved averaging 45.89%. Roasting the same mixture for 3 hours gave slightly 
different results i.e., Pt (97.12%), Pd (66.83%), Cu (73.31%) and Ni  (92.51%) with 36.97% 
Fe c-oextracted. It was observed that MgCl 2 dissolves more platinum than palladium, while 
the opposite is true for CaCl 2. It should be noted that these roasts are not oxidising roasts in 
the conventional sense of the word, but rather a non- smelting thermal treatment step.

1. INTRODUCTION  
Prior work to date included the following steps:  
• A literature review of the direct leach approaches used for Ni -Cu-PGM ores.  
• Mineralogical characterisation of the ore sample  
• Electrochemical study of sperrylite in acidic an alkaline media  
• Base metal removal using direct leach, and sulfating roast -leach processes.  
• Early investigations of the use of thiocyanate and alkaline glycine as lixiviants  for 
platinum and palladium.  
While it was shown that palladium can be readily leached, it was found that the Panton 
deposit’s main form of platinum mineralisation is sperrylite (platinum arsenide) . This has 
proven particularly challenging for any leach process that was not preceded with some form of thermal treatment. In prior work, a hot sulfuric acid bake has shown much potential to 
selectively remove the base metals  without co -dissolution of iron and chromium. While 
palladium leaching was acceptable, platinum leaching in acidic thiocyanate was found to be inadequate. Conversely, it was found that an alkaline cyanide catalysed glycine leach also did not perform satisfactorily with respect to platinum leaching.  
 Given these challenges, we reconsidered the  way ahead and looked at a chloride salt roast 
of the ore. This was considered given PGM’s known ability to dissolve in chloride systems, even though chloride systems to date involved either an acid chloride pressure oxidative leach (POX) or an atmospheric acidic chloride leach with chlorine gas injection which is used for high grade PGM concentrates after base metals removal. The salt roast is therefore novel and makes use of cheap and environmentally benign chlorinating agents such as calcium chloride, which is used in large amounts around the world to salt roads for ice- removal in

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
3.1. Sighter testwork on sulfation roast and water leach processes  
3.1.1. Screening tests on 650°C sulfation roast — Selection of roasting conditions  
Ore samples were blended with varying amount of Na 2SO 4 and roasted without prior curing 
at 650°C for different periods of time ranging from 15 minutes up to 2 hour  residence time . 
Calcines were then either externally air -cooled or cooled inside the roaster, reground and 
subsequently leached for 24 hours at 80°C  using distilled water.

 At 1 denotes ore blended with 5 wt% Na 2SO 4 and 462 kg/t H 2SO 4, then the calcine was allowed to cool inside the roaster.  
 At 1* denotes same as above, but the calcine was externally air -cooled.  
 At 2 denotes ore blended with 10 wt% Na 2SO 4 and 462 kg/t H 2SO 4, then the calcine was allowed to cool inside the roaster.  
 At 2* denotes same as above in 2, but the calcine was externally air -cooled.  
 
The results in Figure 1 show  that copper extraction decreases with the rise in roasting time 
and when the calcine is air -cooled. It has been postulated that  longer roasting time leads to 
further decomposition of already formed sulfates to oxides, which are insoluble in water (Guo et al., 2009). Furthermore, the cooling must be performed in higher temperature gas flowrate 
to prevent the re- oxidation of any copper sulfates, possibly due to the reaction with oxygen at 
high temperatures.  
 
However, nickel displayed different leaching behaviour with t he air -cooled calcines 
presenting a slightly higher extraction over the inside- furnace slow- cooled ones. In addition,  
an extraction decrease of approximately 16.66% was observed when the roasting temperature was raised from 550 to 650°C under optimal conditions reported by Mpinga et al. (2017). This can be linked to the decreased amount of residual SO
3 in the calcines. 
Nevertheless, at 15 minutes maximum nickel and copper sulfation could be achieved which 
results in beneficial energy savings .

Base metals recovery may be further improved by observing one or the combination of the following propositions: 1) addition of mor e Na
2SO 4 in the mixture to the roaster (Basturkcu 
and Acarkan, 2016; Yu et al., 2014; Guo et al., 2009), 2) use of slightly acidified (H 2SO 4) 
distilled water (Zhao et al., 2015; Fursman, 1962) and/or 3)  increase of leach temperature. 
Higher temperatures are not only operationally achievable, but also recommendable for enhancing the leaching kinetics.  
 McDonald and Whittington (2008) stated that higher temperatures improve nickel extraction kinetics for sulfuric acid- based atmospheric leaching. To reduce the energy consumption, it is 
also worth stressing that the cooling of calcines is a source of heat recovery (Güntner and Hammerschmidt, 2012). Therefore, any sulfation roast -leach system should be equipped with 
a cooling system, which improves the economic o ptimization of the process.  
 
3.1.2. Kinetics of atmospheric base metals aqueous solubilization  
Fine milled calcines and leaching near solution boiling point were applied for extracting both 
copper and nickel. Prior to this, H
2SO 4 concentration in the roaster mixture was made large 
enough (500 kg/t ore) to completely suppress Na 2SO 4 contribution. As can be seen in 
Figure 2 , the extent and rate of Cu extraction were higher than Ni reaching 85% in 
30 minutes  (first data point). The use of acidified water facilitated almost complete Cu 
extraction. Nickel dissolution, on the other hand, reached 92.10% after 24 hours. The 
serpentine crystalline structure of the ore virtually determines nickel attainable extraction, as the adjustment of the leaching conditions has only a limited influence.

3.1.3. Precious metals recovery from leach residue of above process  
The residue from the above primary leach was rinsed with DI water, dried and weighed 
before being subjected to a second leach with sulfuric thiocyanate solutions — and/or spiked 
with iodide ion as a catalyst — to ensure complete dissolution of PGM components. 
Generally the presence of complexing agents influences the potential of metals, since they 
replace the molecules of hydration or solvation of dissolved ions.  
 
Complexing agents lower potential standards of metal dissolution and facilitate the corrosion/leaching (Ghali, 2010). In this view, thiocyanate may be even more effective in accelerating platinum corrosion at atmospheric temperature and pressure. Hancock et al. 
(1977) stated that the standard reduction potential of Pt(SCN)
−2
4 in 0.5 M KSCN was 
369 mV SHE.

40 g/L SCN−, solution pH of 2, oxygen flowrate of 0.1 mL/min, pulp density of 5%w/v and

The leaching percentage vs. time plotted in Figure 3 shows that Pt remains unleached . This 
is consistent with dissolution kinetics reported in inorganic acids under ambient conditions. The presence of CuSCN
(s) (if any) in the system could also have a negative effect on the  
leaching rate (Li et al., 2012). In general the residue showed very poor and slow palladium dissolution followed by plateaus indicating that the rate was limited by either reactants diffusion or surface passivation.  
 Palladium leaching never exceeded 50% even in presence of iodide as a catalyst. The mixture SCN(I) + I(I ) dissolved less than SCN(I) used alone. The content of silica gel may

reduce its catalytic performances (Cameron and Reyerson, 1935). Furthermore according to 
Aylmore (2005), the typical operating region of iodide is between solution pH 5 and 9.  
 
3.2. Alk aline leach system  
3.2.1. Kinetics of atmospheric base metals aqueous solubilization  
To ensure quality results and reproducibility, the alkaline glycine dissolution was performed 
in triplicate, using unroasted raw ore samples having 64 µm as mean particle size. Result in 
Figure 4 shows that alkaline glycine is not an effective leaching agent for the investigated 
ore. Only 39.55% Ni and 47.11% Cu were recovered after 72  hours leach. The process 
requires substantially more time for satisfactory recovery.

solution pH of 12 at 50°C,  oxygen flowrate of 0.1 mL/min,  P80 of 64 µm, pulp density of 20%w/v 
and rotational rate of 600 rpm  
 3.2.2. Precious metals recovery from leach residue of above process  
In order to recover PGMs from the residue of above step, the material was roasted for 3 hours and reground to approximately 16 µm size. As shown in Figure 5 , roasting is an 
ineffective treatment prior to alkaline glycine leach, since 0% Pt is recovered from the product heated to 650°C for 3 hours. The addition of 1 g/L cyanide offers remarkable advantage over alkaline glycine leach used alone. However, palladium solubilization slows after one hour leach probably due to cyanide depletion from the system.

conditions are noted in figure captions  
 
Although base metals beneficiation through  sulfation roast is straightforward, however, the 
difficulty lies in further processing the leach residue for PGMs dissolution. To our best 
knowledge, chlorine gas usage has been routinely required in many known two- stage leach 
processes (Liddell and Adams, 2012; Tatarnikov  et al., 2004).  This avenue of research might 
also be exploited as elaborated in the next paragraphs . 
 
3.3. Sighter testwork on solid salt chlorination roast -leach  
Mixtures of raw ore, CaCl 2, MgCl 2, SnCl 2 and AlCl 3 were roasted without prior curing at 
650°C for different periods of time ranging from 15 minutes up to 6 hour residence 
time (Figure 6). The calcines were then inside- furnace- cooled, to ascertain the influence of 
roasting time on the conversion extent of base and precious metals into their corresponding 
chloride salts.

Legend:   
 Extra denotes ore blended with 500 kg/t CaCl 2 + 40 kg/t SnCl 2 and roasted at 650°C for 3 hours, then the reground calcine

It was observed during the roasting process, the dissipation into air of valuable HCl and Cl 2 
— evidenced by volatile materials on crucible lids — causing changes to the concentrations 
of both reactants and products. This drives the chlorination reaction to the left , leading to the 
low platinum extraction shown in Figure 6. Although difficult to make a sound and engineered 
interpretation of such results from the use of somewhat inadequate chlorination apparatus, 
however, one pertinent empirical observation can be made: the solubilization of Cr is not deemed to be of major c oncern.  
 The covering of crucible tops was not enough to contain the build- up of gases (excess 
pressure) and prevent their escape before reacting with the mixture. According to Le Chatelier’s principle, at constant temperature and constant volume, the pressure can be reduced only by reducing the number of moles of gas. In other words, the reaction will occur in the direction that relieves the stress of the increased pressure (McMurry and Fay, 1995).  
 The use of lightly covered (not sealed) crucibles doesn’t allow for very precise control of the process chemistry, which means immediate correction for any changes as well as the prediction of optimum conditions and the reproducibility of the results. The reaction between platinum and chlorine is not rapid (Landsberg and Schaller, 1971). It is therefore 
indispensable to roast in a specially designed reactor enhancing the dispersion of the in-situ 
generated Cl
2 into the mixture. This is key to the success of any solid salt chlorination 
process targeting platinum  extraction.  
 
To obtain valuable evidence that may support the formation of PtCl−2
6 and/or PtCl−2
4, excess 
amounts of chlorinating agent ranging up to 3x the sample weight were applied to drive the 
reaction and to ensure complete metals chlorination. As can be seen from Figure 7, the 
extent of Pt chlorination increases with increased chlorinating agent concentration. High 
percentages of copper and nickel and various percenta ges of iron were extracted over a 
wide range of roasting time.

 Test 7 denotes ore blended with 1 t AlCl 3/t ore and roasted at 650°C for 3 hours.  
 
Six hours roast using CaCl 2 have the advantage of extracting acceptable amount of Pt 
(75.59%) and Pd (93.28%) while avoiding excessive iron dissolution (16.85%)  and 
insignificant chromium dissolution. The roast of CaCl 2 mixture for 3 hours translated in poor 
platinum and palladium extractions i.e., 9.60 and 66.86% respectively after 24 hours leach. No significant difference has been observed when MgCl
2 was used in 3 or 6 hours roast, both 
cases presenting high iron dissolution, but with platinum extraction exceeding the 95% mark. AlCl
3 proved to be an adequate chlorinating agent for palladium only, with extractions 
exceeding 90% for both 3 and 6 hours roast.  
 
3.3.1. Kinetics of atmospheric base and precious metals aqueous solubilization  
Although an optimum operation time should be decided in industry practice , with regard to 
the current investigation, prolonging the leach time beyond about 30 minutes in Figure 8 or 
3 hours in Figure 9 does not appear to improve significantly the proportions recovered.

3.3.2. Conceptual flowsheet  
Based on experimental results and observations, a simplified single- stage conceptual 
flowsheet for recovering principal pay metals is proposed for a hydrometallurgical pilot plant, 
an economic evaluation and assessment of potential environmental impacts. The recovery unit operations include, among others, solid salt chlorination roast step, which plays a pivotal 
role in the proposed flowsheet displayed in Figure 10 .

This is a radical redesign of the direct leach process  for high chromite PGM ore, such as the 
Panton sill ore  with the aim of reducing its reagents consumption, downtime and the 
avoidance of its major drawback of burning the resin in order to recover the loaded precious metals. Note that resin regeneration is crucially important for keeping the process cost down.   Atmospheric lea ch process of Panton PGM -Ni-Cu ore

4. CONCLUSIONS  
A detailed experimental program was undertaken to solubilize Cu, Ni, Pt and Pd from a 
PGM -bearing chromite ore. Two treatment routes including single- stage and two- stage leach 
are presented in this report . The low-temperature  process util ising a  single -stage CaCl 2 and 
MgCl 2 solid salt chlorination proved successful for simultaneously and efficiently leaching 
said metals without the need and/or addition of oxidizing agents.  
 The key success of the process resides in roasting in a specially  designed reactor to 
enhance the dispersion of the in- situ generated Cl
2 into the slurry. Both thermo- hydrolysis of 
chloride salts and chlorine partial pressure are important ingredients in the leaching reaction of PGMs.  Excellent leach beneficiation was achieved in tests averaging 98.87% Pt and 
73.52% Pd with no significant concentrations of deleterious chromium (4.04%).  
 It was observed that MgCl
2 dissolves more palladium  than platinum , while the opposite is 
true for CaCl 2. Platinum and palladium can be recovered from the pregnant solution, 
preferably before copper and nickel, by using highly PGM selective ion- exchangers.  Resin -
in-pulp (RIP) would be an attractive option, in order to avoid the solid/liquid separation and 
the unavoidable soluble losses of PGMs.

Atmospheric leach process of PGMs from a chromite-rich Cu-Ni PG M ore in oxidized mineralization and their recovery from the le achate 
Panton project — Progress report 5     	2	
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This progress report has been prepared to outline key findings of research undertaken as 
part of Mining Research Institute of Western Australia (MRIWA) project M0458 and is 
sponsored by Panoramic Resources Limited and Panton Sill Pty Ltd.  
This project commenced in 2015 and is scheduled for completion in October 2019. 
The research presented in this report was undertaken by the Gold Technology Group at Curtin 
University and forms part of an investigation into the developm ent process steps for treating 
PGM-bearing chromite ore in order to recover metal values contained therein on run-of-mine 
ore material in oxidized mineralization derived from Panoramic Resources Panton deposit.  
Prior work covered by previous progress reports includes: 
A literature review of the direct leach approaches used for Ni -Cu-PGM ores;
Mineralogical characterisation of the ore sample;
Electrochemical study of sperrylite in acidic and alkaline med ia;
Base metal removal using direct leach, and sulfating roast-lea ch processes;
Direct leach approaches to Panton Sill ore; and
Preliminary results into the use of chloride salt roast leachi ng and use of weak-base anion-
exchange resin diethy laminoethyl (DEAE) ce llulose as a potential quantitative batch-scale
method for separating Pt(IV) and Pd(II) from a large excess of various interfering cations
and anions in chloride solutions (Progress Report 4).
The objective of this progress report (Progress Report 5) is to  update the preliminary results 
presented in Progress Report 4.  
While the work presented in Progress Reports 1 to 3 demonstrate d that palladium can be 
readily leached, the Panton Sill deposit’s main form of platinu m mineralization (platinum 
arsenide) has proven particularly challenging for any leach pro cess that was not preceded with 
some form of thermal treatment. In prior work, a hot sulfuric acid bake has shown much 
potential to selectively remove the base metals without co-diss olution of iron and chromium. 
While palladium leaching was acceptable, platinum leaching in acidic thiocyanate was found 
to be inadequate. Conversely, it was found that an alkaline cya nide catalysed glycine leach 
also did not perform satisfactorily with respect to platinum leaching. 
Given these challenges, we reconsidered the way ahead and looked at a chloride salt roast of 
the ore. This was considered given PGM’s known ability to disso lve in chloride systems, even 
though chloride systems to date involved either an acid chlorid e pressure oxidative leach Atmospheric leach process of PGMs from a chromite-rich Cu-Ni PG M ore in oxidized mineralization and their recovery from the le achate

(POX) or an atmospheric acidic chloride leach with chlorine gas injection which is used for high 
grade PGM concentrates after base metals removal. The salt roas t is therefore novel and 
makes use of cheap and environmentally benign chlorinating agen ts such as calcium chloride 
and magnesium chloride, which are used in large amounts around the world to salt roads for ice-removal in countries receiving large amounts of snow and ice. 
Leach beneficiation was achieved averaging 99.7% Pt and 100% Pd  with relatively low co-
extraction of deleterious chromium (0.31%) when using intermediate crushed ore (P
80 = 30 μm) 
leached at 90°C for a minimum of 3 hours in 6 M HCl that mimic typical industrial concentration. 
Therefore, high Cr content can be allowed in the flotation concentrate without adversely 
affecting PGM recovery.  
As this work was undertaken on a sample with a particle size of 30 µm and given the high 
extraction rates observed it is considered that grinding finer than 30 µm would not be necessary if this technique is adopted.  
Weak-base anion-exchange resin diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulo se was found to be 
successful for quantitative batch-scale separation of Pt(IV) and Pd(II) from a large excess of 
various interfering cations and a nions in chloride solutions. T he resin adsorption showed high 
selectivity, fast kinetics, relatively high loading capacity, g ood elution properties and can 
operate at expected residual acid concentrations from upfront l eaching streams (~2.5 M HCl) 
without pH adjustment.  
Results of the DEAE separation process showed that the maximum loading capacity of the 
resin for Pt(IV) and Pd(II) can reach 32.6 and 36.9 mg/g, which represents 96 and 98% 
adsorption of Pt and Pd respectively, and 90.7% of the overall loading capacity.  
It is acknowledged that this research was undertaken on a run-o f-mine ore, whilst in practice 
the process would be more commercially attractive on a low-grade rougher concentrate at high 
flotation mass pull (e.g. 10%), which should in turn yield increasing PGMs concentration in the

1. INTRODUCTION 
Work undertaken on this project outlined in Progress Reports 1 to 3 included the following key 
steps: 
 A literature review of the direct leach approaches used for Ni -Cu-PGM ores; 
 Mineralogical characterisation of the ore sample; 
 Electrochemical study of sperrylite in acidic and alkaline med ia; 
 Base metal removal using direct leach, and sulfating roast-lea ch processes; and 
 Direct leach approaches to Panton Sill ore.

Section 3.3 of this report.   
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.1. Leaching stage  
Simultaneous use of CaCl
2 and MgCl 2 played a significant role in catalysing the chlorination 
process. The results demonstrated (Figure 1) that the dissoluti on of palladium was fast and 
the endpoint was reached within 30 minutes (first data point) as compared to platinum, which 
needed slightly prolonged leaching time of 3 hours to reach max imum extraction.  
 The results also suggested that prolonging the leach time beyon d 6 hours does not appear to 
significantly improve the proportions recovered. Hence, 6 hours  was adopted as maximum 
recovery time to ensure complete extraction. Pt and Pd were undetectable in all leach residues.

and 600 rpm (calcination with CaCl 2/MgCl 2 1:1, 3t/t ore) 
 
Prior to chlorination roast, the ore was grind to P 80 of 30 µm, therefore the chlorinated calcine 
was leached without additional regrinding. In this way, an asse ssment of the combined effect 
of mineral liberation and surface exposure was attempted. 
 3.2. Adsorption and elution stages 
3.2.1. Effect of equilibration time on Pd(II) and Pt(IV) adsorp tion rate 
As it is an important variable in validating the adsorbent choi ce, time progression was 
examined to ensure optimal and quantitative real-time uptake of  targeted metal ions. The 
adsorption percentage vs. time plotted in Figure 2 demonstrates  that both Pd(II) and Pt(IV) 
adsorption were fast and equilibrium was reached within the fir st 30 minutes achieving 100% 
as compared to base metals, such as Cu, Cr and Fe, which needed  extended adsorption time 
up to 24 hours to reach ~8%, with the shape of their curves indicating that plateaus have been 
reached. This is consistent with findings by Ishida et al. (196 8), who successfully separated 
trace amounts of Pt(IV) and Pd(II) from large quantities of com mon base metal ions at 25°C.

Figure 2: Comparative curves showing adsorption kinetics of PGM s and selected common 
accompanying ions in synthetic chloride solutions using DEAE cellulose resin at solid-to-liquid 
ratio of 1%w/v and room temperature. Feed solution: 0.58 g/L SCN(I), 0 g/L Sn(II), 5 mg/L Pt(IV), 
5 mg/L Pd(II), 50 mg/L Co(II), 100 mg/L Cr(III), 1 g/L Cu(I), 1  g/L Ni(II), 5 g/L Fe(III), 10 g/L Mg(II) and 
20 g/L Ca(II) contained in 2.5 M HCl  
 
Attempts have been made to address base metal co-adsorption, i. e. by shortening the 
adsorption time (Table 1). In general, the presence of Fe(III) and other accompanying non-
ferrous metal ions do not show any marked tendency to adsorb. I t is likely that their actual co-
adsorption is ascribed to decreased concentrations of Pt(IV) an d Pd(II) that creates a large 
concentration gradient, which determines the driving force of the overall uptake rate.   However, these co-adsorbed metals can be displaced with appropriate wash solutions. In this context, prior to elution, Ishida et al. (1968) scrubbed the lo aded DEAE resin with a mixture of 
0.01 M NH
4SCN and 0.1 to 1 M HCl to remove co-extracted base metal impuri ties. Platinum 
and palladium were then stripped with 0.05 M SC(NH 2)2.

3.2.2. Effect of ۼ۱܁ି and Sn2+ initial concentrations on Pd(II) and Pt(IV) adsorption rate 
The experimental layout and results of the 15 minute adsorption trials are listed in Table 1. The 
effect of thiocyanate concentration on PGMs adsorption rate was  examined in the 0 to 0.01 M 
(0.58 g/L) range. The results indicate a rapid increase in platinum extraction from 67.05% at 
zero SCN(I) concentration to a maximum of 100% at 0.58 M SCN(I), with which 99.9% of the palladium was extracted (Tests 1, 5 and/or 4). 
 
In addition, the results indicate that the pre-soaking of the r esin (converting its sites with 
desired SCN
ିcounter ions) has a notable effect on the adsorption mechanism only in complete 
absence of SCN(I) in solution (Tests 3 and 6). Irrespective of Sn(II) composition in the leach 
liquor, tests with virgin and pre-soaked resins gave 100% adsorption of both Pt(IV) and Pd(II) 
in presence of SCN(I) (Tests 1, 2 and 3). Note that the increas ed amount of calcium and 
magnesium in solution didn’t cause any solution scaling.  The effect of Sn
2+ concentration on PGM adsorption rates was examined in the 0 to 0.001 M 
(0.12 g/L) range. At zero Sn(II), 100% Pt(IV) and 100% Pd(II) w ere extracted (Test 1). Hence 
the effect of Sn(II) concentration was not as important as the effect of SCN(I) concentration in determining the most appropriate processing route.   
Adsorption tests in the presence and/or absence of Sn(II) at a time as a collector and a 
labialising agent — but in presence of SCN(I) — gave approximat ely similar PGM recoveries 
of 100% (Tests 1, 2 and 3). It can be inferred that its dual role was simply overridden, 
overshadowed by the high selectivity of DEAE for PGMs. Hence SCN(I) initial concentration was the most important variable for the overall adsorption of the two adsorbates. 
 3.2.3. Evaluation of adsorption isotherm models  
The adsorption data were fitted with both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. Based 
on the Fisher z-transform of correlation coefficient values (R
2) obtained from the data (Table 2) 
in Figure 3, the Freundlich model provided a better fit than th e Langmuir model in the case of 
Pt(IV), but not so with Pd(II) at a 95% confidence level.  
Table 2: Coefficients generated  from the fitting of Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms

                    Panton project — Progress report 5                   	8	
The fitting of Freundlich model implies that the active sites of DEAE surface are heterogeneous 
for metal adsorption and, the occurrence of a multilayer adsorp tion mechanism involving weak 
Van der Waal forces, hydrogen bonding and/or Coulombic attraction forces. The magnitude of 
Freundlich constant k f indicates easy uptake (affinity) of Pt(IV) and Pd(II) from aqu eous 
solution.  
 Since ‘’n’’ lies between 1 and 10, this indicate physical adsor ption of Pt(IV) and Pd(II) onto 
DEAE  under the reported conditions. Physical adsorption processes ar e generally rapid and 
largely reversible.  
 
Figure 3: Equilibrium adsorption is otherms for Pt(IV) and Pd(II) loading onto 10 g/L anion 
exchanger DEAE cellulose for 15 minutes contact time at room te mperature. Feed solution: 
0.58 g/L SCN(I), 0 g/L Sn(II), 50 mg/L Pt(IV), 50 mg/L Pd(II), 50 mg/L Co(II), 1 g/L Cu(I), 1 g /L Ni(II), 
5 g/L Fe(III), 10 g/L Mg(II) and 20 g/L Ca(II) contained in 2.5  M HCl 
3.2.4. Adsorption rate controlling step  
During the loading sequences, partially loaded resins were sepa rated from solutions for 
2 hours per cycle. From the interruption test results given in Figure 4, an increase can be seen 
in kinetics taking place after every resin re-immersion in solu tions. This means that intra-
particle diffusion was the prominent mechanism in operation as the rate controlling step. In 
other words, interruption tests strongly indicated that film di ffusion was minimal or non-existent.

Figure 4: Effect of interruption tests on Pd(II) and Pt(IV) ads orption rate onto DEAE cellulose. 
Feed solution: 0.58 g/L SCN(I), 0 g/L Sn(II), 50 mg/L Pt(IV), 50 mg/L Pd(II), 50 mg/L Co(II), 1 g/L 
Cu(I), 1 g/L Ni(II), 5  g/L Fe(III), 10 g/L Mg(II) and 20 g/L Ca (II) contained in 2.5 M HCl 
 
It is clear that Pt(IV) and Pd(II) were extracted into the resi n up to 7th contact, and thereafter 
remained almost constant. The cumulative loading capacity of DE AE cellulose for these two 
metals was observed to be respectively 32.6 and 36.9 mg/g representing 90.7% of the overall 
loading capacity. A higher loading capacity implies better util ization of the resin. In addition, 
high adsorption capacity avoids excess resin to elution stage.  
 The adsorption mechanism of PGMs involves the fixation of their  chloro-anion complexes on 
the positively charged amino group in a "purely" anion exchange  extraction mechanism as 
illustrated in Equation 1, where ܴ

3.2.5. Isocratic elution process of Pd(II) and Pt(IV) from load ed resin matrix 
Elution curves for bulk stripping of combined Pd(II) and Pt(IV) are shown in Figure 5. More 
than 99% of both palladium and platinum was successfully eluted  in only two bed volumes 
(1 bed volume = 25 mL) under ambient conditions, resulting in a  small volume of highly 
concentrated PGMs eluate which is suitable for downstream processing. Note that a 
comprehensive discussion on elutio n process is beyond the inten ded scope of this research, 
however according to Dyosi et al. (2009), the elution reactions  might be explained by 
Equations 2 and 3. For reasons of convenience and presentation “Tu’’ denotes SC(NH 2)2 i.e. 
thiourea molecule.

PGMs are then recovered from thiourea strip liquors by reduction-precipitation using alkali 
metal borohydride e.g. NaBH 4, according to reactions in Equations 4 and 5. Awadalla et al. 
(1994) stated that PGMs reduction by NaBH 4 increases with temperature increase and is fast 
i.e., the reaction is complete within one minute and reduced products are stable for at least 
12 hours.

3.3. Conceptual flowsheet  
Based on above experimental results and observations, a conceptual flowsheet for recovering 
principal pay metals i.e., Cu, Ni, Pd and Pt, is proposed for hydrometallurgical pilot scale testing, economic evaluation and assessment of potential environmental impacts. Its recovery 
unit operations include, among others, the molten salt chlorination roast and the standard ion 
exchange resin technology, which p lays pivotal roles in the sch ematic flow diagram displayed 
in Figure 6.

Figure 6: Conceptual hybrid process flowsheet for platinum grou p metals (PGMs) recovery from 
a chromite-rich Cu-Ni PGM bearing ore in oxidized mineralizatio n through a single-stage leach 
and adsorption onto ion exchange resin. Dashed lines indicate t he switching to elution and 
regeneration mode when the resin in a column is fully loaded wi th precious metals (Mpinga et 
al., 2018b) 
 
This is a redesign of the process developed for the Panton deposit in Western Australia (Figure 7) with the aim of reducing its reagents consumption, d owntime and the avoidance of 
its major drawback of burning the resin in order to recover the  loaded precious metals. Resin 
regeneration is crucially important for keeping the process cos t down. Of special interest is the 
non-requirement of a swing in solution pH that would not only i ncur higher operating costs for 
additional reagent make-up downstream, but also the potential of releasing HCN due to cross 
contamination.  
 The original “Panton process’’ was developed for the high-chromite Panton Sill ore in oxidized mineralization which was problematic as the deposit size and remoteness could not justify the erection of a smelter, and the high chromite content of the flotation concentrates made it 
difficult to secure an offtake agreement with existing smelters  at the time (2003-2007). 
Additional information on flowsheet complexity and shortcomings  of the ‘’Panton process’’ is 
found in Mpinga and co-workers (2017).

Figure 7: Panton process conceptual flow schematic (Lewins and Greenaway, 2004) 
 
The solubilization of PGMs was the prime driving force behind t he flowsheet (Figure 6) 
development and optimization. Their dissolution rate is high en ough to be considered for scale-
up (Mpinga et al., 2018a). Owing to its high selectivity for PG Ms, DEAE resin can be scaled 
down in small columns, on which trace concentrations of PGMs can be retained from very large volumes of base metals and other common accompanying ions . In order to minimize 
resin handling and associated resin losses, adsorption and elut ion may be performed in a 
same column. In practice, according to McKevitt (2007), automat ically switching the column 
from loading to stripping after a designated number of bed volumes could easily be achieved by programming a process logic controller (PLC).  
4. CONCLUSIONS 
The hybrid pyro-hydrometallurgical and low-temperature single-s tage molten salt 
(CaCl
2/MgCl 2) chlorination technique proved successful for simultaneously a nd efficiently 
leaching Cu, Ni, Pd and Pt from a chromite-rich Cu-Ni PGM beari ng ore in oxidized 
mineralization without the need and/or addition of further oxid izing agents.  
 
Using cheap and readily available reagents (CaCl 2 and MgCl 2 are routinely used for snow and 
ice control on roadways), the process typically entails roastin g operation at 650°C for 6 hour 
residence time, resulting in almost complete chlorination with the formation of intermediate 
products.  
 Leach beneficiation was achieved averaging 99.7% Pt and 100% Pd  with relatively low co-
extraction of deleterious chromium (0.31%). Therefore, high Cr content can be allowed in the 
flotation concentrate without adversely affecting PGM recovery.

Using weak-base anion exchange resin DEAE cellulose, a successf ul quantitative batch-scale 
separation of Pt(IV) and Pd(II) from a large excess of various interfering cations and anions in 
chloride solutions is described in this report. DEAE adsorption  decreased PGMs content to 
less than ICP-MS detection limit of 0.001 mg/L within 15 minutes with Pd(II) and Pt(IV) 
recoveries approximating 100% each. The results showed that the maximum loading capacity of the resin for Pt(IV) and Pd(II) can reach 32.6 mg/g and 36.9  mg/g, which represents 96% 
and 98% adsorption of Pt and Pd respectively, and 90.7% of the overall loading capacity. 
 The results also indicated that with only few bed volumes (2 to  4), using 0.05 M thiourea as 
eluant, more than 99% of the adsorbed solutes could be successfully eluted; resulting in a small volume of highly concentrated PGMs eluate which is suitab le for downstream 
processing. PGMs are then recovered from thiourea strip liquors  by reduction-precipitation 
using alkali metal borohydride e.g. NaBH
4. In order to minimize resin handling and associated 
resin losses, adsorption and elution may be performed in a same column.   With the development of the flowsheet herein by The Western Australian School of Mines, 
substantial PGM recoveries from oxide and mixed oxide/sulfide o res are now possible. The 
technique is intended to be a direct treatment route from flotation concentrate to PGM refinery 
feed.    Atmospheric leach process of PGMs from a chromite-rich Cu-Ni PG M ore in oxidized mineralization and their recovery from the le achate

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This progress report has been prepared to outline key progress made during the 
reporting period for the Mining Research Institute of Western Australia (MRIWA) 
project M0458, sponsored by Panoramic Resources Limited and Panton Sill Pty Ltd.  
The research associated with this project has been undertaken b y the Curtin University, Gold 
Technology Group. This project is aimed at developing a process for treating a PGM-bearing 
chromite ore, in order to recover metal values contained therei n, on run-of-mine ore material 
in oxidized mineralization derived from Panoramic Resources Pan ton deposit.  
This project commenced in 2015 and is scheduled for completion in October 2019. 
Research presented in previous progress reports (Progress Repor ts 1 to 4) explored a number 
of options to extract and recover Platinum and Palladium from a  PGM-bearing chromite ore. A 
novel new method to extract PGM’s that involved a chloride salt  roast has been developed as 
part of this project. A leach beneficiation averaging 99.7% pla tinum and 100% palladium, with 
relatively low co-extraction of deleterious chromium (0.31%) ha s been demonstrated on ore. 
Weak-base anion-exchange resin diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulo se was also found  to be 
successful for quantitative batch-scale separation of Pt(IV) and Pd(II) from a large excess of 
various interfering cations and anions in chloride solutions.   
Work undertaken during  this reporting period consisted predomin antly  of office-based work, 
focusing on the compilation of a PhD thesis for examination, and the publication of the research 
findings of in four peer reviewed journal articles.  
No significant laboratory work was conducted during the reporting period.  
Research undertaken during the next reporting period (to be reported  in Progress  Report 6) 
focused on the completion  of the PhD thesis for examination  and the preparation of a PGM 
concentrate.  The PGM concentrate is to be used to test the PGM chloride salt roast extraction 
methodology developed as part of this project, which has only b een tested on an ore to-date.

1. INTRODUCTION
This progress report has been prepared to outline key progress made during the 
reporting period for the Mining Research Institute of Western Australia (MRIWA) 
project M0458, sponsored by Panoramic Resources Limited and Panton Sill Pty Ltd.  
The research associated with this project has been undertaken b y the Curtin University, Gold 
Technology Group. This project is aimed at developing a process for treating a PGM-bearing 
chromite ore, in order to recover metal values contained therei n, on run-of-mine ore material 
in oxidized mineralization derived from Panoramic Resources Pan ton deposit.  
Research presented in previous progress reports (Progress Reports 1 to 4) explored a number 
of options to extract and recover Platinum and Palladium from a  PGM-bearing chromite ore. A 
novel new method to extract PGM’s that involved a chloride salt  roast has been developed as 
part of this project. A leach beneficiation averaging 99.7% pla tinum and 100% palladium, with 
relatively low co-extraction of deleterious chromium (0.31%) ha s been demonstrated on ore. 
Weak-base anion-exchange resin diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulo se was also found  to be 
successful for quantitative batch-scale separation of Pt(IV) and Pd(II) from a large excess of 
various interfering cations and anions in chloride solutions.   
This project commenced in 2015 and is scheduled for completion in October 2019.

The availability of oxidized PGM ore deposits, at or near the earth's surface, present lucrative prospects for future
PGM production owing to the large resource estimates, the relatively high PGM grades and they can be mined
through relatively lower-cost open-pit mining processes. However, these oxidized PGM ores are currently notmined or treated due to insuﬃcient recoveries using established metallurgical techniques. The complex
mineralogy and polymodal distribution of PGM in the oxidized ores pose a number of challenges to the
metallurgist from a mineral liberation and extraction perspective.
A conceptual route to the integrated processing of a Ni-Cu-PGM bearing chromite ore in oxidized
mineralization for the recovery of base and precious metals is presented based upon earlier work of the authorsand recent research on metal recovery from solution. This paper presents laboratory batch-scale results ofsimultaneous adsorption of Pd(II) and Pt(IV) onto commercially available weak-base anion exchange resin,diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulose, from hydrochloric acid solutions. E ﬀects of various variables such as
equilibration time, thiocyanate and tin chloride concentrations were studied.
Without any prior scrubbing step to remove co-extracted impurities, the uptake of Pd(II) and Pt(IV) was
successfully accomplished with recoveries approximating 100% within 15 min. The presence of Fe(III) and other
non-ferrous metal accompanying ions didn't show any marked tendency to adsorb. Among the adsorption
parameters, thiocyanate concentration had the most signi ﬁcant eﬀ ect on the process. The dual role of Sn(II) i.e.
labilizing agent and PGM collector at a time, was simply overridden, overshadowed by the DEAE high selectivity
for PGMs. Thiourea proved to be a better stripping reagent for bulk elution of combined Pd(II) and Pt(IV). A
conceptual ﬂowsheet is disclosed for hydrometallurgical pilot scale testing, economic evaluation and assessment
of potential environmental impacts.
1. Introduction
The availability of oxidized platinum group metal (PGM) ore deposits,
at or near the earth's surface, present lucrative prospects for future PGM
production owing to the large resource estimates, the relatively high PGM
grades and they can be mined through relatively lower-cost open-pit
mining processes ( Oberthür et al., 2013 ;Evans, 2002).
However, these oxidized PGM ores are currently not mined or
treated due to insu ﬃcient recoveries using established metallurgical
techniques ( Kraemer et al., 2015 ;Becker et al., 2014 ;Bulatovic, 2003 ).
The complex mineralogy and polymodal distribution of PGMs in theoxidized ores pose a number of challenges to the metallurgist from amineral liberation and extraction perspective ( Kraemer et al., 2017;
Cabri et al., 2017).
A process approach has been developed and evaluated for treating
PGM-bearing chromite ores in oxidized mineralization (with platinumcontent predominantly mineralized as sperrylite, and palladium as
palladium antimonides) at atmospheric pressure in order to recover
metal values contained therein ( Mpinga et al., 2017b ). Single-stage
molten salts chlorination roast-leach process was the treatment scenario
observed for leaching simultaneously said metal values without the
need and/or addition of oxidizing agents.

Ttypically entailed the mixing of run-of-mine ore with abovementioned
chlorinating salts on weight percent basis ratio of 1:3 (with equal
weight ratio of CaCl 2and MgCl 2) in a porcelain crucible which resulted
in a sticky paste-like material.
The charged and covered crucible was placed in an unvented elec-
tric or static air roast mu ﬄe furnace equipped with a programmable
temperature controller, and was gradually heated under normal atmo-
spheric pressure and oxygen partial pressure conditions at 650 °C for 6 h
residence time.
Afterwards the roast calcine was leached in 6 M HCl, that mimickes
typical industrial concentration, at 90 °C for 24 h. Excellent leach ben-eﬁciation averaging 99.71% Pt and 100% Pd was recorded, with rela-
tively low co-extraction of deleterious chromium (0.31%). Therefore,high Cr content can be allowed in the ﬂotation concentrate without
adversely a ﬀecting PGM recovery.
Although PGM solubilisation was an important measure of the
overall success of the processing method, the degree to which these arerecovered from pregnant solutions was equally important. PGM chloro-
complexes are generally recovered from pregnant solutions by using the
classical process, which basically involves successive series of salts
precipitation and redissolution steps, and a ﬁnal thermal reduction to
metal ( Demopoulos, 1989 ). Nevertheless, such method is considered
ineﬃcient by today's standards in terms of the degree of separation
achieved, the yields obtained and the complexity of operations involved(Gaita and Al-Bazi, 1995 ;Demopoulos, 1989 ).
The classical method is also not satisfactory for recovering desired
element(s) from diluted media containing precious metals in trace
amounts ( Waitz Jr, 1982 ). Thereby, the introduction of new methods
for meeting such rising analytical standards has been important to theplatinum industry. In this regard, solvent extraction and ion exchange
have been introduced and adopted by some precious metal re ﬁneries
(Nikoloski et al., 2015 ;Demopoulos, 1989).
The objective of the present work was to examine under laboratory
batch-scale conditions, the technical feasibility of using commerciallyavailable anion exchanger diethylaminoethyl cellulose (DEAE) for the
separation and preconcentration of Pt(IV) and Pd(II) in aqueous HCl.
The process could be accomplished by two di ﬀerent routes: (1) selective
extraction of each metal or, (2) group extraction followed by selectivestripping. The latter option was adopted for this study, but with a single
bulk strip of PGMs. This paper presents and discusses the recovery test
results.
2. Theoretical background
2.1. Classical technique for recovering PGMs from pregnant solutions
Until the 1970s, PGM recovery and separation in precious metal
reﬁneries had been achieved by a series of precipitation processesexploiting di ﬀerences in the chemistry of their anionic chloro-com-
plexes ( Nikoloski et al., 2015 ;Koch et al., 2006 ;Bernardis et al., 2005).
Platinum in its tetravalent oxidation state is selectively precipitated as
diammonium hexachloroplatinate(IV), (NH
4)2PtCl 6,by saturating the
mother liquor with ammonium chloride (Eq. (1)); whereas after oxi-
dation to palladium(IV), this latter ion is similarly precipitated (Eq. (2))
as diammonium hexachloropalladate(IV), (NH 4)2PdCl 6(Gaita and Al-
Bazi, 1995 ).

The complexity of this classical technology, sometimes referred to as
a1stgeneration process, proved to have poor selectivity toward PGMs.
Currently, the majority of platinum producing companies make use of
newer technologies to re ﬁne PGMs by 2ndgeneration (solvent extrac-
tion) and 3rdgeneration (ion exchange and/or molecular recognition)
processes ( Nikoloski and Ang, 2014; Crundwell et al., 2011;
Demopoulos, 1989). These last two generations are recognised as po-tentially more e ﬃcient and economically justi ﬁed, even for solutions
containing very low PGM concentrations ( Nikoloski et al., 2015 ).
2.2. Ion exchange resin (IX) as alternative approach for PGMs recovery
2.2.1. Choice of ion exchangers
PGM chloro-complexes have an extremely high a ﬃnity for strong-
base resins. This a ﬃnity is so high that quantitative elution is di ﬃcult
and their recovery from the loaded resins is completed by combustion
(Kononova et al., 2014 ;Shams and Goodarzi, 2006 ;Kyriakakis, 2005;
Demopoulos, 1989). The burning practice is considered economical,owing to both high PGM loading on the resin and their high values.
Despite the abovementioned high a ﬃnity, strong-base resins have
not found signi ﬁcant commercial application in PGM circuits, other
than being metal scavengers from dilute streams ( Kyriakakis, 2005).
The problem with these exchangers is that commercially available re-
sins do not selectively adsorb negatively charged Pt(IV) and Pd(II)
chloro- complexes ( Godlewska- żyłkiewicz, 2004). In other words, they
are not highly selective against iron, the common major solution im-purity.
2.2.2. Weak-base anion exchanger diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulose
As far as could be determined, the earlier work reporting on selec-
tive adsorption of PGM ions from mixed thiocyanato-chloride media is a
series of papers by Kuroda et al. (1968) , who used the weak-base anion
exchange DEAE cellulose in Table 1.
Kuroda et al. (1968) demonstrated the possibility of separating and
concentrating PGM ions from a large quantity of base metals, such asiron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc and lead in a small column of DEAE inNomenclature

chanism is an anion exchange that occurs via the tertiary amine func-
tional group. Anionic species are adsorbed through displacement of an
associated counter ion ( Smith and Moody, 1991).

Furthermore, noble metal ions adsorbed were easily stripped from
DEAE using either only one eluant —isocratic elution which simpli ﬁes
the process —or a mixture of reagents as shown in Table 2.
2.2.3. Adsorption prerequisites: HCl and SCN−concentrations
Warshawsky (1983) reported that the adsorption of chloride com-
plexes of transition metals ions, including PGM ions, onto anion ex-
change resins was acid dependent. Platinum, palladium and gold ad-sorption was high from dilute HCl solutions titrating 0.01 to 0.5 M,
whereas the adsorption of Rh, Ir, Ru, Os and other transition metals
(particularly Fe, Ni, Cu and Co), increased with increasing HCl con-
centration.
In chloride media containing low concentrations of thiocyanate
ions, Ishida et al. (1968) noticed at pH values of 1 to 3, that the chloride
form of DEAE substantially lowers K
dvalues for Pt(IV) and Pd(II), as
compared with values found for DEAE in the thiocyanate form. This
suggests that for e ﬃcient Pd(II) and Pt(IV) extraction, DEAE in the
thiocyanate form is decidedly preferable to its chloride form, especiallywhen the concentration of chloride in solution is high.
2.2.4. Kinetics of adsorption —eﬀect of test interruptions on PGMs
adsorption rate —rate-determining step
Generally typical liquid/solid adsorption involves ﬁlm diﬀusion,
intraparticle di ﬀusion and mass action. Two trends are usually used to
evaluate adsorption kinetics. These are (1) adsorption reaction models,
e.g. pseudo- ﬁrst-order, pseudo-second-order kinetic equations and the
Elovich model and, (2) adsorption di ﬀusion models, including
intraparticle di ﬀusion model and liquid ﬁlm diﬀusion model.
To this end, Zolgharnein and Shahmoradi (2010) emphasized that
one of the following phenomena can be the rate-determining step of an
adsorption process: (1) di ﬀusion through the boundary layer to the
surface of the adsorbent (external di ﬀusion), (2) adsorption of ions onto
sites, and (3) intraparticle di ﬀusion into the interior of the adsorbent.
For physical adsorption, mass action is a rapid process and can benegligible for kinetic studies. Thus, the kinetic process of adsorption isalways controlled by liquid ﬁlm diﬀusion or intraparticle di ﬀusion, i.e.
one of the processes should be the rate limiting step.
Kumar and Jain (2013) ,Zipperian and Raghavan (1985) , and
Fleming and Cromberge (1984) used interrupted batch adsorption tests
to demonstrate the importance of both ﬁlm diﬀusion and intraparticle
mass transfer. If a process is controlled by particle di ﬀusion, the rate ofextraction immediately after the interruption should be faster (fol-
lowing the re-immersion) than it was before the interruption ( Fleming
and Nicol, 1984 ). Otherwise the process is ﬁlm diﬀusion controlled.
2.2.5. Equilibrium data and adsorption modeling
The empirical Freundlich and Langmuir models are among iso-
therms generally used to describe single solute adsorption equilibriumonto either activated carbon or ion exchange resins and to investigate
its mechanism ( Nikoloski et al., 2015; Crundwell, 2013; Zhou et al.,
2009 ). Note that these two isotherms are not predictive, since variables
such as the solution pH and the ionic strength change with changing
conditions ( Pesavento et al., 2010 ).
2.2.5.1. Empirical Freundlich isotherm . The Freundlich isotherm (Eq.
(4)) is derived theoretically under the assumption that the adsorption
energy obeys an
exponential distribution. It describes the multilayer
formation of adsorbate on the heterogeneous solid surface of theadsorbent. The model assumes heterogeneous adsorption due to the
diversity of adsorption sites or diverse nature of metal ions adsorbed,
free or hydrolysed species. The assumptions in this model are also that
stronger binding sites are occupied ﬁrst and that the binding strength
decreases exponentially with the increasing degree of site occupation(Nikoloski and Ang, 2014 ;Adams et al., 1987 ).
=qk Ce fen(4)
kfand n are Freundlich parameters representing the adsorption capacity
and the intensity (surface heterogeneity), respectively. The Freundlich
exponent “n”measures the adsorption deviation from linearity. If
n= 1, then the adsorption is linear; if n< 1, the adsorption is a
chemical process; if n> 1, then adsorption is a physical process
(SenthilKumar et al., 2012). Higher k fvalues indicate higher a ﬃnity
for a given species. k fand n can be determined from the intercept and
slope of the linear plot of log(q e) vs. log(C e) (Eq. (5)). However, the
Freundlich model does not provide information such as maximum
loading as the Langmuir isotherm does.
=+ log q log k nlogCe f e (5)
where log kf= y-intercept and n = slope.
2.2.5.2. The Langmuir isotherm . The Langmuir isotherm in Eq. (6)is
based on the following assumptions: (1) the adsorption energy of all
sites is the same (constant), and is una ﬀected by the adsorption on
neighbouring sites; (2) the adsorption is immobile; (3) each siteaccommodates only one adsorbed particle (monolayer adsorption);
and (4) adsorbed atoms (molecules) do not interact with each other
(Paunovic and Schlesinger, 2006 ). This isotherm model reduces to a
linear form at low concentrations.

Dabrowski (2001) , the Langmuir isotherm is applicable to chemisorp-
tion and with some restrictions to physisorption. Therefore in thisTable 2

3. Materials and methods
3.1. Materials3.1.1. Stock solutions
Owing to insu ﬃcient quantity of material to produce enough leach
liquor, ion exchange tests have been conducted on synthetic solutions
that almost mimicked expected typical industrial leach liquors. The
leachate generated in Mpinga et al. (2017b) 's experimental program at
solid-to-liquid ratio of 5% w/vin 6 M HCl served in part for the pre-
paration of such synthetic solutions. However, the expectation for
ideally using low-grade rougher concentrates at high ﬂotation mass pull
(e.g. 10%) will more likely increase PGMs concentration in the lea-chates.
Synthetic stock solutions of major species were prepared by
dissolving appropriate amount of chloride salts of analytical grade in
2.5 M HCl, which was the average residual acid concentration in the
process pregnant leachates. For abovementioned reasons, it seemed
more reasonable to suggest synthetic solutions ( Table 3 ) containing
approximately 8 times the amount of Pt and 7 times that of Pd presentin the process leachates ( Mpinga et al., 2017b ). Changes of these con-
ditions will be speci ﬁed in saturation loading capacity tests. Suitable
amounts of SCN(I) and Sn(II) were afterward added to the stock solu-
tions to start the adsorption process.
3.1.2. Adsorbent pretreatment
The anion exchange resin diethylaminoethyl (C
20H23O5) from
Toronto Research Chemicals was obtained in the form of 20 to 60 μm
insoluble white beads with approximately 70% moisture content.
Before its use, a known amount was soaked in 1 M NaSCN for 24 h to
convert it into thiocyanate form. The resin was then thorough rinsed
with deionized water until the rinsing water pH was approximately
neutral. The prepared resin was then stored in sealed ﬂasks, with
deionized water added to keep it hydrated, ready to be used for iso-therm and kinetic tests. DEAE in the chloride form was also used.
3.2. Methods
3.2.1. Adsorption stage
Batchwise adsorption tests were performed in open-ended rolling
bottles to allow free circulation of oxygen. These were rotated at 105 rpm
as this was the maximum speed of the device used. Although Ishida et al.
(1968) reached the equilibrium within 15 h at 25 °C when using similar
adsorbent for Pt(IV) and Pd(II) adsorption, in this study the mixture
(resin and solution) was rotated for 24 h to ensure that the equilibrium
was attained. Individual levels of the two selected adsorption input fac-
tors (taken from Mpinga et al., 2017b ) are shown in Table 4 .
Simulating multi-stage countercurrent loading operations, 5 g of resin
was contacted with 500 mL of solution and allowed to equilibrate atroom temperature for 24 h. After ﬁltration, the partially loaded resin was
then placed into another 500 mL of fresh pregnant solution for the same
length of time, after which the separation process was again conducted.
The procedure, also called “repeating contact technique ”, was continued
for a couple of cycles to produce isotherms covering the full range of
metal ion concentrations in solution and on the resin that would be found
in typical counter-current applications ( Fleming and Cromberge, 1984 ).
Samples were collected before and after each contact. The initial
andﬁnal solution concentrations of metal ions present in the solution
were analyzed using ICP-MS. Equilibrium points for each anion in so-lution were then plotted together to generate equilibrium isotherms as
illustrated in Fig. 2. Loading on the resin was determined by mass
balance over each contact, and a cumulative loading over the cyclescould also be calculated.
3.2.2. Elution stage
The desorption of adsorbed metal ions was studied under dynamic
conditions in a ﬁxed-bed glass column with ~9 mm interior diameter
and ~45 cm height. The exchange column previously ﬁlled with dis-
tilled water was then ﬁlled with the loaded resin until it settles. This
procedure was imperative as it prevents air spaces (bubbles) in the resin
bed which would lead to channelling. Acting as a calming zone, glass
beads were added to improve the ﬂow distribution avoiding physical
disturbance of the resin bed. The loaded resin was eluted for PGMsusing various fresh bed volumes of 0.05 M thiourea ( Ishida et al., 1968).
It should be noted that a bed volume relates to the volume (25 mL in
this investigation) of the empty column ( Davidson and Schmidt, 1986).
The eluent was downward passed through the column at the ﬂow rate
of 1 mL/min controlled by a peristaltic pump ( Fontàs et al., 2009 ;Gaita
and Al-Bazi, 1995; Ishida et al., 1968). In this context, Weber (1997)
stated that ion exchange process cannot occur e ﬃciently if the ﬂow rate
is too high. In both adsorption and elution studies, aliquot samples of2 mL were collected at predetermined time intervals or at speci ﬁc bed
volume intervals and
analyzed for residual metals by means of ICP-MS.
4. Results and discussion
4.1. E ﬀect of equilibration time on Pd(II) and Pt(IV) adsorption rate
As it is an important variable in validating the adsorbent choice,
time progression was examined to ensure optimal and quantitative real-
time uptake of targeted metal ions. The adsorption percentage vs. time
plotted in Fig. 1 demonstrates that both Pd(II) and Pt(IV) adsorption
were fast and equilibrium was reached within the ﬁrst 30 min achieving
100% as compared to base metals, such as Cu, Cr and Fe, which needed
extended adsorption time up to 24 h to reach ~8%, with the shape of
their curves indicating that plateaus have been reached. This is con-
sistent with ﬁndings by Ishida et al. (1968) , who successfully separated
trace amounts of Pt(IV) and Pd(II) from large quantities of commonbase metal ions at 25 °C.

91Attempts have been made to address base metal co-adsorption, i.e.
by shortening the adsorption time ( Table 5). In general, the presence of
Fe(III) and other accompanying non-ferrous metal ions do not show any
marked tendency to adsorb. It is likely that their actual co-adsorption is
ascribed to decreased concentrations of Pt(IV) and Pd(II) that creates a
large concentration gradient, which determines the driving force of the
overall uptake rate.
However, these co-adsorbed metals can be displaced with appro-
priate wash solutions. In this context, prior to elution, Ishida et al. (1968)
scrubbed the loaded DEAE resin with a mixture of 0.01 M NH 4SCN and
0.1 to 1 M HCl to remove co-extracted base metal impurities. Platinum
and palladium were then stripped with 0.05 M SC(NH 2)2.
4.2. E ﬀect of SCN−and Sn2+initial concentrations on Pd(II) and Pt(IV)
adsorption rate
The experimental layout and results of the 15 min adsorption trials
are listed in Table 5 .T h ee ﬀect of thiocyanate concentration on PGMs
adsorption rate was examined in the 0 to 0.01 M (0.58 g/L) range. Theresults indicate a rapid increase in platinum extraction from 67.05% at
zero SCN(I) concentration to a maximum of 100% at 0.58 M SCN(I), with
which 99.95% of the palladium was extracted (Tests 1, 5 and/or 4).
In addition, the results indicate that the presoaking of the resin
(converting its sites with desired SCN
−counter ions) has huge e ﬀect on
the adsorption mechanism only in complete absence of SCN(I) insolution (Tests 3 and 6). Irrespective of Sn(II) composition in the leachliquor, tests with virgin and presoaked resins gave 100% adsorption of
both Pt(IV) and Pd(II) in presence of SCN(I) (Tests 1, 2 and 3). Note that
the increased amount of calcium and magnesium in solution didn't
cause any solution scaling.
The eﬀect of Sn
2+concentration on PGM adsorption rates was
examined in the 0 to 0.001 M (0.12 g/L) range. At zero Sn(II), 100% Pt(IV) and 100% Pd(II) were extracted (Test 1). Hence the e ﬀect of Sn(II)
concentration was not as important as the e ﬀect of SCN(I) concentration
in determining the most appropriate processing route.
Adsorption tests in the presence and/or absence of Sn(II) at a time as
a collector and a labilizing agent —but in presence of SCN(I) —gave
approximately similar PGM recoveries of 100% (Tests 1, 2 and 3). It can
be inferred that its dual role was simply overridden, overshadowed by
the high selectivity of DEAE for PGMs. Hence SCN(I) initial con-
centration was the most important variable for the overall adsorption of
the two adsorbates.
4.3. Evaluation of adsorption isotherm models
The adsorption data were ﬁtted with both Langmuir and Freundlich
isotherm models. Based on the Fisher z-transform (See Appendix A )o f
correlation coe ﬃcient values obtained from the data in Fig. 2, the
Freundlich model provided a better ﬁt than the Langmuir model in the
case of Pt(IV), but not so with Pd(II) at a 95% con ﬁdence level.
4.4. Adsorption rate controlling step
During the loading sequences, partially loaded resins were sepa-
rated from solutions for 2 h per cycle. From the interruption test results
given in Fig. 3, an increase can be seen in kinetics taking place after
every resin re-immersion in solutions. This means that intraparticlediﬀusion was the prominent mechanism in operation as the rate con-
trolling step. In other words, interruption tests strongly indicated thatﬁlm diﬀusion was minimal or non-existent.

92It is clear that Pt(IV) and Pd(II) were extracted into the resin up to
7thcontact, and thereafter remained almost constant. The cumulative
loading capacity of DEAE cellulose for these two metals was observed to
be respectively 32.57 and 36.86 mg/g representing 90.69% of the
overall loading capacity. A higher loading capacity implies better uti-
lization of the resin. In addition, high adsorption capacity avoids excess
resin to elution stage. The adsorption mechanism of PGMs involves the
ﬁxation of their chloro-anion complexes on the positively charged
amino group in a “purely ”anion exchange extraction mechanism as
illustrated in Eq. (10).

4.5. Isocratic elution process of Pd(II) and Pt(IV) from loaded resin matrix
Elution curves for bulk stripping of combined Pd(II) and Pt(IV) are
shown in Fig. 4. More than 99% of both palladium and platinum wassuccessfully eluted in only two bed volumes (1 bed volume = 25 mL)
under ambient conditions, resulting in a small volume of highly con-
centrated PGMs eluate which is suitable for downstream processing.
Note that a comprehensive discussion on elution process is beyond the
intended scope of this research, however according to Dyosi et al.
(2009) , the elution reactions might be explained by Eqs. 11 and 12. For

PGMs are then recovered from thiourea strip liquors by reduction-

reduction by NaBH 4increases with temperature increase and is fast i.e.,
the reaction is complete within 1 min and reduced products are stable
for at least 12 h.

4.6. Conceptual ﬂowsheet
Based on above experimental results and observations, and earlier
research relating to the salt-baking and leaching of the PGM-bearing
chromitite ore in oxidized mineralization, a conceptual ﬂowsheet for
recovering principal pay metals i.e., Cu, Ni, Pd and Pt, is proposed forhydrometallurgical pilot scale testing, economic evaluation and as-
sessment of potential environmental impacts. Its recovery unit opera-
tions include, among others, the molten salt chlorination roast and the
standard ion exchange resin technology, which plays pivotal roles in the
schematic ﬂow diagram displayed in Fig. 5.
This is a radical redesign of the process developed for the Panton
deposit in Western Australia ( Fig. 6) with the aim of reducing its re-
agents consumption, downtime and the avoidance of its major draw-
back of burning the resin in order to recover the loaded precious metals.

through a single-stage leach and adsorption onto ion exchange resin. Dashed lines indicate the switching to elution and regeneration mode when the resin in a
column is fully loaded with precious metals.C.N. Mpinga et al. Hydrometallurgy 178 (2018) 88–96
93Resin regeneration is crucially important for keeping the process cost
down. Of special interest is the non-requirement of a swing in solution
pH that would not only incur higher operating costs for additional re-
agent make-up downstream, but also the potential of releasing HCN due
to cross contamination.
The original “Panton process ”was developed for the high-chromite
Panton Sill ore in oxidized mineralization which was problematic as the
deposit size and remoteness could not justify the erection of a smelter,
and the high chromite content of the ﬂotation concentrates made it
diﬃcult to secure an o ﬀtake agreement with existing smelters at the
time (2003 –2007). Additional information on ﬂowsheet complexity and
shortcomings of the “Panton process ”is found in Mpinga et al. (2017a) .
The solubilisation of PGMs was the prime driving force behind the
ﬂowsheet ( Fig. 5) development and optimization. Their dissolution rate
is high enough to be considered for scale-up ( Mpinga et al., 2017b ).
Owing to its high selectivity for PGMs, DEAE resin can be scaled down
in small columns, on which trace concentrations of PGMs can be re-
tained from very large volumes of base metals and other common ac-
companying ions. In order to minimize resin handling and associated
resin losses, adsorption and elution may be performed in a same
column. In practice, according to McKevitt (2007) , automatically
switching the column from loading to stripping after a designatednumber of bed volumes could easily be achieved by programming a
process logic controller (PLC).
5. Conclusions
In another laboratory evaluation, the hybrid pyro-hydro-
metallurgical and low-temperature single-stage molten salt (CaCl
2/
MgCl 2) chlorination technique proved successful for simultaneously
and eﬃciently enable leaching a chromite-rich Cu-Ni PGM bearing ore
in oxidized mineralization without the need and/or addition of further
oxidizing agents. Excellent leach bene ﬁciation was achieved averaging
99.71% Pt and 100% Pd with relatively low co-extraction of deleteriouschromium (0.31%). Therefore, high Cr content can be allowed in the 
ﬂotation concentrate without adversely aﬀecting PGM recovery.
Using weak-base anion exchange resin DEAE  cellulose,  a  successful 
quantitative batch-scale separation of Pt(IV) and Pd(II) from a large 
excess of various interfering cations and anions in chloride solutions is 
reported in this paper. DEAE adsorption decreased PGMs content to less 
than ICP-MS detection limit of 0.001 mg/L within 15 min with Pd(II) 
and Pt(IV) recoveries approximating 100% each. The results showed 
that the maximum loading capacity of the resin for Pt(IV) and Pd(II) can 
reach 32.57 and 36.86 mg/g, which represents  96 and 98% adsorption 
of Pt and Pd respectively, and 90.69% of the overall loading capacity.
The results also indicated that with only few bed volumes (2 to 4), 
using 0.05 M thiourea as eluant, > 99% of the adsorbed solutes could 
be successfully eluted; resulting in a small volume of highly con-
centrated PGMs eluate which is suitable for downstream processing. 
PGMs are then recovered from thiourea strip liquors by reduction-
precipitation using alkali metal borohydride e.g. NaBH 4. In order to 
minimize resin handling  and associated resin losses, adsorption and 
elution may be performed in a same column. With the development of 
the ﬂowsheet herein by The Western Australian School of Mines, sub-
stantial PGM recoveries from oxide and mixed oxide/sul ﬁde ores are 
now possible. The technique is meant to be a direct treatment route 
from ﬂotation concentrate to PGM reﬁnery feed.

This means that the 95% con ﬁdence limit around the di ﬀerence between the z-transforms of the metals would be:

Upper limit Pt (95%): −1.206 + 1.96 ∗0.53 =−0.158
Since the sign of the upper and lower limits are the same, the di ﬀerence between the two z-transforms is not zero and hence the di ﬀerence
between the corresponding correlation coe ﬃcients is also not zero, in other words one model is signi ﬁcantly better (95% con ﬁdence) than the other.

For Pd, the di ﬀerence between the two models does not seem to be signi ﬁcant at a 95% con ﬁdence level and hence it is not possible to
diﬀerentiate between the ﬁts of the two models at a 95% con ﬁdence level.

The fast depletion of sul ﬁde PGM-bearing minerals and the deteriorating socio-political environments in most
primary PGM producing countries have triggered interest in exploring the recovery of these metals from high-
chromium PGM-bearing oxidized ores –sometimes contain relatively high marketable PGM values –which have
proven to be more di ﬃcult to process by conventional metallurgical practice which involves grinding, milling,
frothﬂotation into a sul ﬁde concentrate, smelting and matte production and chemical re ﬁning.
This paper reports the results of an extensive evaluation campaign performed in both acidic sulfuric and
chloride media. Leach tests were conducted in either a single-stage or a two-stage process and the results are
compared and contrasted. Using a high-chromium PGM oxidized mineralized ore, the hybrid pyro-hydro-
metallurgical and low-temperature single-stage salt chlorination process proved successful for simultaneouslyand eﬃciently leaching Cu, Ni, Pt and Pd without the need and/or addition of further oxidizing agents. Thetechnique is expected to be a direct treatment route from ﬂotation concentrate to PGM re ﬁnery feed.
Various chlorinating agents, including CaCl
2, MgCl 2, SnCl 2and AlCl 3, were tested. A CaCl 2and MgCl 2mixture
acted synergistically for simultaneous dissolution of both Pt and Pd, achieving 99.7% Pt and 100% Pd recoverywhen thermally calcined at 650 °C, at a heating rate of 5.42 °C/minute for 6 h, and then leached at 90 °C for a
minimum of 3 h in 6 M HCl. Copper and nickel extraction were lower but had not plateaued even after 24 h
reaching 75.4 and 90.9% extraction respectively.
It was also observed that when MgCl
2was used on its own, it dissolves more platinum than palladium, while
the opposite was true using CaCl 2. The leaching process was controlled by surface chemical reactions with a
determined activation energy of 46 kJ/mol. The dissolution rate was limited by the ratio of HCl volume-to-solidcontent. The recovery mechanism of Pt from PtAs
2and some recommendations for future prospects have been
suggested.
1. Introduction
The fast depletion of sul ﬁde PGM-bearing minerals and the
deteriorating socio-political environments in most primary PGM
producing countries have triggered interest in exploring the recovery
of these metals from high-chromium PGM-bearing oxidized ores –
sometimes contain relatively high marketable PGM values –which have
proven to be more di ﬃcult to process by conventional metallurgical
practice which involves grinding, milling, froth ﬂotation into a sul ﬁde
concentrate, smelting and matte production and chemical re ﬁning
(Sefako et al., 2017; Kraemer et al., 2015; Bulatovic, 2003 ).
In general, the processing of high-chromium oxidized ores by con-
ventional ﬂotation techniques typically results in very poor concentrate
grade and PGM recoveries ( Becker et al., 2014; Lewins and Greenaway,
2004; Bulatovic, 2003). Previous attempts to extract PGMs from suchore type have proved uneconomic due to low recoveries ( ≪50%)
achieved by conventional metallurgical methods ( Oberthür et al.,
2013 ). Hence if an oxide ore cannot be preconcentrated, the method of
treatment will have to accommodate large volumes of relatively low-
grade material containing PGMs in a wide variety of mineral forms
(Evans, 2002) that cause hydrometallurgical processes to be in-
appropriate. At present, oxide ores are either left in-situ , stockpiled or
discarded as waste ( Oberthür et al., 2013 ).
There has been some considerable research aimed at improving
ﬂotation recoveries of oxidized PGM ores by employing techniques such
as (1) controlled potential sul ﬁdization prior to ﬂotation ( Kalichini
et al., 2017; Becker et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2009; Newell et al., 2006 ),
(2) acid pretreatment of ores before ﬂotation ( Luszczkiewicz and
Chmielewski, 2008 ) and (3) the use of various ﬂotation reagent
schemes ( Becker et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2009; Bulatovic, 2003; Lee

Tet al., 1998; Assis et al., 1996). Besides these techniques, direct leaching
approaches have also been tested, where sperrylite has been found to be
the main residual platinum bearing mineral remaining undissolved
(Mpinga et al., 2017; Sefako et al., 2017; Mwase and Petersen, 2017;
Kraemer et al., 2015 ).
This study follows on from earlier work by the same authors
(Mpinga et al., 2017; Mpinga et al., 2015) where the investigation focus
was to optimise the recovery of copper, nickel, platinum and palladium
from a complex, chromite-rich Ni-Cu-PGM oxidized mineralized ore.
This paper presents the results of exploratory research aimed at ex-
tracting these metals through either a single or a two-stage leach pro-
cess. The results of sulfation roast as well as a salt chlorination roast are
presented, followed by various aqueous processing options. Most of the
emphasis was on the atmospheric pressure chlorination roast pretreat-
ment followed by an acid chloride leach of the oxidized ore as it proved
most eﬀ ective. Emphasis was also placed on platinum (mineralized as
sperrylite) due to its reputation of being more refractory towards oxi-dation/dissolution in comparison with other precious metals (mi-
nerals).
2. Theoretical background
2.1. Base metals bene ﬁciation for exposing refractory PGMs
Base metals bene ﬁciation associated with PGM ores in oxidized
mineralization has been extensively reviewed by Mpinga et al. (2017) .
These authors outlined the signi ﬁcance of H
2SO4concentration on
sulfation roast process prior to water leach. Their results revealed that
most of the leaching occurred in the ﬁrst 60 min ( ﬁrst data point)
achieving 86% overall Ni extraction. A small increase of 4% was at-tained after 24 h and the curve plateaued at approximately 90%. In
addition, only a low percentage of chromium and iron (10.40 and
13.60% in the ore, respectively) accompanies copper and nickel as
water-soluble sulfates (0.80 and 1.46%, respectively).
However, the mineralogical characterization unfortunately still
identiﬁed the presence of sperrylite in the water leach residues fol-
lowing the roast at 550 °C. To the best knowledge of the authors,chlorine gas is required to improve the extraction in a two-stage leach
process ( Liddell and Adams, 2012; Tatarnikov et al., 2004). PGM-
bearing concentrates are leached under aggressive conditions in a HCl/Cl
2medium ( Sole et al., 2005 ). The HCl/Cl 2leach approach is not
suitable for low-grade ores or concentrates, but rather highly con-centrated PGM feedstocks as found in PGM re ﬁneries. Therefore, the
dissolution e ﬃciency of refractory PGM minerals such as PtAs
2might
only be improved by thermal pretreatment processes supposed to in-ﬂuence the oxidation state of arsenic in the sul ﬁde melt.
Hence instead of sulfation bake, a molten salt chlorination bake
process performed at 650 °C, which lies just below the temperatures at
which copper and nickel ferrites form (670 and 764 °C, respectively)
and just above the temperatures (500 –600 °C) at which PtAs
2starts to
decompose ( Muir and Ariti, 1991; Okamoto, 1990 ) would be appro-
priate to volatilize and remove arsenic in the o ﬀ-gas stream or as a
calcium arsenate Ca 3(AsO 4)2compound. The sublimation point of ar-
senic is 613 °C ( Dunn et al., 1995).
2.2. Thermodynamic considerations –minimum concentration of HCl as
lixiviant
The Eh-pCl diagram (pCl being the negative logarithm of the Cl
concentration) in Fig. 1 presents the stability regions of platinum
chlorocomplexes. Their domain exists below the oxygen line and hence,from a thermodynamic viewpoint, the leaching of platinum metal is
possible in chloride solutions containing oxygen. The diagram also
shows that under high chemical potential of chloride ions, i.e. in the
low pCl region, the complex ions
−PtCl62and−PtCl42are more stable than
Pt chlorides and Pt oxides ( Horike et al., 2012).−PtCl62predominates ata wide area of acidic and high potential regions. This implies that
chlorinated platinum can be dissolved in acidic chloride-ion-containing
solutions without requiring a strong oxidant, as it is already present in
an oxidized valent state.
The stability of PGM chlorocomplexes increases at higher chloride
ion concentrations in solution, and this also increases their dissolution
eﬃciency ( Horike et al., 2012; Mahmoud, 2003 ).Baglin et al. (1985)
emphasized that half reactions for their dissolution in chloride mediaare not dependent upon solution pH, but are strongly dependent on
chloride concentration (Eqs. (1) and (2) ).Dawson and Kelsall (2007)
stated that it is usual practice when dissolving PGMs in acidic chloridemedia to use chloride concentrations of > 3 M, in order to increase
their product solubilities and depress their equilibrium potentials.

Industrial leach liquors generally contain up to 6 M HCl ( Malik and
Paiva, 2010). In this context, Nikoloski and Ang (2014) have observed
that−PtCl62predominates in acidic solutions when HCl is ≥3 M, while
−PdCl42dominates for concentrations of ≥0.1 M, and−RhCl63is the
prevailing species when HCl is ≥6 M. Although a standard potential
higher than 730 mV SHE(Eq. (1)) is required to oxidize Pt (s), the rate of
this reaction is far too slow for practical purposes ( Benke and Gnot,
2002 ).
2.3. Molten salt chlorination roasting
It has been stated that following a salt fusion, platinum metals
cannot be brought into solution, or can only be brought into solution
with unsatisfactory yields without special measures ( Schlecht, 1958).
Among those measures, a requisite quantity of water may be added tofacilitate increased physical contact between reactants in the roasting
process ( Han and Kim, 2006 ). Water is added such that the resulting
mixture forms into a paste-like consistency ( Mpinga et al., 2017; Han
and Kim, 2006).
Molten salt chlorination roasts are typically carried out in the pre-
sence of moisture and in mildly reducing atmospheres. Moisture has
been considered to be an essential component in the process for the
production of HCl and/or Cl
2(Eqs. (3)–(6)) by pyrohydrolysis of
chloride salts under the catalysis of silica ( Zhou et al., 2016). Chloride
salts –preferably CaCl 2or MgCl 2–are chosen based on their low
melting points and low vapour pressures as compared to the tempera-ture (650 °C in this study) and the nature of the roasting reactor to be
used.

(aq) (6)
The melting point of chloride salts varies signi ﬁcantly depending on
their degree of hydration. It is as low as 30 °C for CaCl 2·6H 2O, while
772 °C for anhydrous CaCl 2; likewise MgCl 2·6H 2O is 117 °C and 714 °C
for anhydrous MgCl 2. At molar ratio of 1:1, Venkatesh et al. (2016)
found that MgCl 2/CaCl 2eutectic melting occurs at 625 °C. Hence base
and precious metals chlorination may occur through MgCl 2/CaCl 2eu-
tectic melt in the reaction product layers. According to Doná et al.
(2009) ,C l 2is able to attack Pt surface to form PtCl 4(Eq.(7)). Platinum
chloride (PtCl 4) is the only chloride of platinum species that is soluble
in water ( Renner et al., 2001; Gee, 1920). Other PGM chlorides that
could form during the roasting stage may include: PtCl 2, PtCl 3, PtCl 4
and PdCI 2(Chusova and Semenova, 2008 ).

However, the stable temperature ranges of Pt chlorides in the pre-
sence of Cl 2gas are reported to be lower than 382 °C for PtCl 4, 382 to
450 °C for PtCl 3, and 435 to 515 °C for PtCl 2(Horike et al., 2012 ).
Above 380 °C, Renner et al. (2001) found out that PtCl 4liberates
chlorine and forms PtCl 2(Eq. (8)), which is stable between 435 and
580 °C. According to Horike et al. (2012) , PtCl 2is produced by heating
Pt metal in Cl 2gas at 650 °C followed by cooling to 500 °C. The chlor-
ination rate of platinum chloride formation is also dependent upon
chlorine partial pressure ( Landsberg and Schaller, 1971 ).
2.4. Mineral liberation and surface exposure
Direct cyanidation of ores and concentrates has been found e ﬀective
only when precious metals were largely liberated in the earlier grindingstages ( Green et al., 2004; Robins and Jayaweera, 1992 ). PGM minerals
in chromite-rich materials such as UG-2 (Upper Group 2 reef in SouthAfrica) and the Panton Sill deposit (in Western Australia) have sig-
niﬁcantly smaller average grain sizes (3 –11 µm) and require ﬁne
grinding for full liberation. Lottering et al. (2008) attempted to di ﬀer-
entiate ore liberation and surface exposure. They pointed out that
surface exposure was a very good indicator of the leachability, because
only intrinsic kinetic inertness to leaching reagents can cause an ex-
posed mineral to remain unleached.
2.5. Kinetics analysis –selection of a model –reaction controlling
mechanism
Platinum dissolution being the rate limiting factor, the leaching
kinetics was assessed by using the classical: (1) shrinking core model
(SCM) and (2) shrinking spherical particle (SSP). According to the
shrinking model, when a process is controlled by any of the mechanisms
in Eqs. (9)–(13), its left side plotted versus time should give a straight
line –assessed by using correlation coe ﬃcient (R
2) values –where the
slope is the leaching rate constant. Using the Arrhenius Equation (Eq.
(14)) to determine the activation energy of the leaching process, the
obtained reaction rate constants (displaying high correlation coe ﬃcient
values) were plotted against the reciprocal of the absolute temperature.

Asamoah-Bekoe (1998) calculated the activation energy of
acid-soluble and chlorine soluble PGMs to be 23.05 and 42.36 kJ/mol,
respectively. The reaction mechanisms were found to be generally
chemical reaction controlled. This gives an idea of the order of
magnitude of the expected activation energy in this study. A value of Ea
over 40 kJ/mol implies charge transfer, chemical or surface-controlledprocesses (linear leaching), whereas an E
aof less than 40 kJ/mol sug-
gests that the leaching process is controlled by di ﬀusion (parabolic
leaching) ( Li et al., 2013 ). Generally, as argued by Crundwell (2013) ,
the activation energy is below 20 kJ/mol for di ﬀusion-controlled
reactions, and it is above 40 kJ/mol for chemical-controlled reactions.
3. Materials and methods
3.1. Materials3.1.1. Run-of-mine ore sample
The oxidized run-of-mine ore sample used in this study was from
Panton Sill Deposit. This is the same ore that was previously used and
described by Mpinga et al. (2017) . Its elemental and mineralogical
compositions are displayed in Table 1. Unless otherwise noted, the P
80
mean size of particles fed to the roasting processes was either 30 or

lines) ( Horike et al., 2012 ).C.N. Mpinga et al. Minerals Engineering 125 (2018) 165–175
16764μm. Prior to subsequent leaching processes, only the 64 µm calcined
material was reground to P 80of 16 µm.
3.1.2. Reagents and solutions
Analytical Reagent grade NaSCN (98%), SnCl 2(98%), KI (99%), HCl
(37%), H 2SO4(98%), CaCl 2·6H 2O (99%), MgCl 2·6H 2O (98%) and
AlCl 3·×H2O (95%) (used without further puri ﬁcation) were dissolved as
required in distilled water to make up test solutions and/or used in
mixtures fed to the roaster. In order to avoid ageing, all test solutions
were freshly prepared on a daily basis.
3.2. Methods
A set of sixty tests were conducted to develop an e ﬀective process to
extract base and precious metals from the oxidized run-of-mine ore in
Table 1. Samples were subjected to a series of exploratory roasting and
leaching tests aimed at identifying appropriate testwork parameters and
to obtain estimates of their optimum dosage conditions. The experi-
mental setup and procedures are the same as those described previously
(Mpinga et al., 2017 ). The only di ﬀerence was an increased roasting
temperature of 650 °C instead of 550 °C and a shortened sulfationroasting time of 15 min instead of 2 h.
Chlorination roasting tests were conducted in a mu ﬄe furnace with
speciﬁed amount of charge per batch, after mixing thoroughly for 5 min
in a crucible the run-of-mine ore and chloride salts in a particular massratio. The calcination was conducted at 650 °C for up to 6 h in a covered
crucible (not sealed) then cooled to room temperature inside the fur-
nace, before being leached in 6 M HCl at 95 °C and 1 to 5%w/v for 24 h
with mechanical agitation provided by an overhead sealed-shaft stirrer
driven at 600 rpm. Any changes in variables are noted in the ﬁgures
showing their e ﬀect. The in ﬂuence of roasting time, leaching time,
dosage of various chloride salts and hydrochloric acid on leaching rateof base and precious metals was investigated separately.
To prevent further reaction with the leached material which may
have been carried over from the process, aliquots of 3 mL were col-
lected at speci ﬁc timed intervals through 0.45 μm pore size syringe
ﬁlters, and analysed for dissolved metals by ICP-MS. The slurry wasﬁltered and the residue was washed thoroughly several times with
distilled water to remove any physically attached ions or any unreactedligands (reagents) and oven-dried at 110 °C for 24 h prior to chemical
and mineralogical characterisations. Assuming no metal losses due to
the formation of volatile chlorides, the percentage metal extraction
(
XM) was estimated using Eq. (16), wheremtandmfare the metal mass

4. Results and discussion
4.1. Exploratory sulfating roast-leach
Insights into the conditions needed for roasting were obtained by
Mpinga et al. (2017) . They reported sperrylite was still present in the
leach residues when sulfated roasted at 550 °C. A higher roast tem-
perature of 650 °C was investigated in this study to ensure sperrylite
would decompose. This was based on the assumption that increasing
the roast temperature above the As-Pt eutectic of 597 °C ( Okamoto,
1990 ), would enable the arsenic to be released. Its concentration in the
calcined ore was reduced from 185 to less than 0.5 g/t. Mineralogicalexamination con ﬁrmed sperrylite had decomposed (see Section 4.3).
Fig. 2 shows the extraction of base metals from the 650 °C, 15 min
sulfate calcined ore. Cu and Ni were easily leached reaching > 85% in
1 h with ﬁnal extractions of 99.0% and 92.1% respectively in 24 h. Pt
and Pd showed poor dissolution (< 0.5%) while Fe and Cr dissolutionwas 12 and 3% respectively. A secondary leach was investigated to
improve the extraction of Pt and Pd. The primary leach residue was
leached in sulfuric acid with thiocyanate at 50 and 85 °C in the presence
and absence of iodide as a catalyst ( Fig. 3 ). Pt in all cases failed to leach
(< 0.2%) and less than 40% of the Pd was extracted.
No matter the temperature, the extraction of palladium quickly
plateaued after 4 h and lower extraction were observed in the presenceof iodide. This poor performance was attributed to additional iron
dissolution in the second leach ( ∼45%) which is likely to have pre-
cipitated as a jarosite (iron hydroxide) ( Broadhurst and Du Perez, 1993 )
and would possibly passivate the surface. Jarosite-type compounds
have the ability to precipitate iron from acidic leach solutions
(Dutrizac, 1983 ). The actual reason for the mixed ligand system per-
forming poorly is unclear and requires further investigation.
Special attention should be paid to the recent complementary work
byShaik and Petersen (2017) . They investigated the e ﬀectiveness of
thiocyanate, cyanide and ferricyanide to act synergistically for ex-
tracting Pt from pure PtAs
2specimen in both acidic and alkaline solu-
tions. The use of pure mineral eliminated potential harmful inter-ferences and ideally allowed to more accurately determine ﬁrst-hand
the rate and extent of platinum extraction only, prior to examiningmethods of treating low-grade and other complex platiniferous mate-
rials.
In alkaline media, sperrylite was shown to be refractory with
leaching e ﬃciencies of < 10% under the combination of lixiviants
tested, i.e. 5.9 and 8.1% extraction were achieved respectively with
− −CN/ F e ( C N )63and−− −SCN /CN /Fe(CN)63systems within 30 h at 50 °C.
On the other hand in acidic-−SCN solution used on its own or combined
with ferricyanide as an oxidant, sperrylite remained completelyunleached, corroborating ﬁndings from this work. These results prove
just how refractory PtAs
2can be.
4.2. Exploratory molten salt chlorination roast-leach
4.2.1. E ﬀect of residence time –reacted chloride
To improve the extraction of Pt and Pd, a chlorination roast-leach
was investigated. Mixtures of CaCl 2, MgCl 2, SnCl 2and AlCl 3were addedTable 1

168to the ore and roasted at 650 °C for di ﬀerent periods of time ranging
from 15 min up to 6 h ( Figs. 4 and 5 ). After calcination, the residues
were leached in 6 M hydrochloric acid at 95 °C for 24 h. Note the cal-
cines were allowed to cool inside the furnace, to ascertain the inﬂ uence
of roasting time on the conversion and extent of base and preciousmetals into their corresponding chloride salts and if any volatile com-
ponents evolved.
Fig. 4 displays the leach results which showed increasing extraction
of Pt and Pd with increasing reaction time. Cu showed the opposite
response while Ni and Fe extraction showed little variation with roastresidence time. Notably very little Cr (< 0.4%) was extracted. In some
tests there were stains from volatile components on the crucible lid. The
loss of chlorine is expected to result in less PtCl
4(or PtCl 2) formation
and this is the reason for poorer platinum extractions shown in Fig. 4.
Testing to gain a preliminary insight into the volatile behaviours of
some species –especially chloride –involved in the roasting process,thermal tests was carried out at 650 °C to quantify the amount of re-acted chloride and its magnitude loss. In such operations, mass losses
are common. These may be assigned to: (I) the removal of physical and
perhaps chemical water, (II) sulfur dioxide emission, (III) volatilisation
of solid chlorides, or (IV) formation of intermediate products, etc.
To investigate chloride deportment, a mixture comprising 10 g
ore + (15 g CaCl
2+ 15 g MgCl 2) was split into two fractions for
roasting tests comparison. One fraction was left to dry in oven at 110 °Cfor 24 h to remove surface moisture. The other portion was thoroughly
mixed in a tared crucible. This was weighed and transferred to themuﬄe furnace heated at 650 °C for 6 h. The calcine was then allowed to
cool inside the furnace. Afterward the crucible was weighed and thepercentage “mass loss ”calculated as the ratio of weight loss to the in-
itial weight of the sample. The dried and baked materials were groundusing a mortar and pestle. Samples of both fractions were analysed by
XRF.

169At the end of 6 h heat treatment and taking into account the amount
(subtracted) of surface water, an overall mass loss of ∼20% was re-
corded. Table 2 summarizes the mass changes of some selected species
during the roasting. According to the chloride mass-balance, only 73%
of it remained in the calcine product, i.e. some reacted; while the re-
maining 27% constitutes a signi ﬁcant loss (probably through Eqs.
(3)–(5)), given the overall amount of chloride salts supplied.
4.2.2. E ﬀect of chloride salt
To obtain evidence that may support the formation of platinum
chlorides, excess amounts of chlorinating agent ranging up to 3 times
the ore mass were applied to drive the chlorination reaction (Eq. (7))t o
the right and to ensure complete metal chlorination. As can be seenfrom Fig. 5, the extent of Pt chlorination varied depending on the
chlorinating agent and the residence time. High extractions of copperand nickel and moderate percentages of iron were also extracted overthe testing regime.
A six hour roast using CaCl
2had the advantage of extracting ac-
ceptable amount of Pt (75.59%) and Pd (93.28%) while avoiding ex-
cessive iron dissolution (16.85%). The roast with CaCl 2for 3 h trans-
lated in poor platinum and palladium extractions, i.e. 9.60 and 66.86%respectively after 24 h leach. No signi ﬁcant di ﬀerence was observed
when MgCl
2was used in 3 or 6 h roast, both cases giving high iron
dissolution, and achieved platinum extraction exceeding the 95% mark.
AlCl 3proved to be an adequate chlorinating agent for palladium only,
with extractions exceeding 90% for both 3 and 6 h roast.
It was anticipated that the combination of raw ore, CaCl 2and MgCl 2
mixture roasted at 650 °C for 6 h would act synergistically for si-multaneous dissolution of both Pt and Pd. Such tests were performed
and the results are summarized in Fig. 6. The extractions of Pt and Pd
are both close to 100% (Test 1). The dissolution of chromium wasminimal (1.62%), whereas iron reported to solution in relatively high
concentration (38.6%).
At this stage there isn’ t information available to speculate on the
mechanisms taking place through the abovementioned synergy.
Thereby, further investigation in this direction would appear to be
warranted ( Mpinga and Eksteen, 2018 ). In addition, it is unclear as to
which of the speci ﬁc roasting factors (roasting time, roasting tem-
perature and chlorinating agents’ dosage), the leaching e ﬃciency of

170both copper and nickel are correlated to. Their incomplete leaching
may be attributed to the phase transformations occurring during heat
treatment of the spinel host, which ultimately determines their max-
imum attainable extractions.
4.2.3. E ﬀect of HCl concentration on platinum and palladium leaching from
calcines
The eﬀect of HCl concentration on platinum and palladium leaching
from chlorinated calcines is displayed in Fig. 6. Platinum showed a
larger decrease in extraction compared to palladium as HCl con-
centration was decreased from 6 to 1 M. The platinum extraction also
decreased signi ﬁcantly with decreasing chloride salt content in the
roast. The decrease in chloride concentration due to CaCl 2/MgCl 2
starvation, probably decreased the availability of Cl 2(g)on the basis of
Eqs. (3)–(5), which accordingly decreased platinum conversion per-
centage according to Eq. (7).
4.2.4. E ﬀect of leaching time
Simultaneous use of CaCl 2and MgCl 2played a signi ﬁcant role in
catalysing the chlorination process. The results demonstrated ( Fig. 7)
that the dissolution of palladium was fast and the endpoint was reached
within 30 min ( ﬁrst data point) as compared to platinum, which needed
slightly prolonged leaching time of 3 h to reach maximum extraction.The results also suggested that prolonging the leach time beyond 6 hwas unnecessary. Hence, 6 h was adopted as maximum recovery time to
ensure complete extraction. In all leach residues, Pt and Pd remained
well below the analytical detection limit o ﬀered by ﬁre assay.
Prior to chlorination roast, the ore was ground to P
80of 30 µm,
therefore the chlorinated calcine was leached without additional re-
grinding. In this way, an assessment of the combined e ﬀect of mineral
liberation and surface exposure was attempted.
4.2.5. E ﬀect of leaching temperature
To determine the in ﬂuence of temperature on PGMs solubilization,
leaching tests were performed at four di ﬀerent temperatures: 25, 50, 75
and 90 °C. Each dissolution experiment was conducted for 24 h at an
agitation rate of 600 rpm. The solid-to-liquid ratio was kept constant at
5%w/v. Unlike ambient temperature palladium leaching processes,
platinum dissolution rate increased with an increase in temperature.This may be due to the thermal stability of platinum chlorocomplexes
(Hernandez and Choren, 1983).
The results also showed only slight di ﬀerence between samples
leached at 75 and 90 °C. It is worth noting that a temperature of 70 °C is
industrially practiced by Impala Platinum Metal Re ﬁnery for optimal
leaching ( Asamoah-Bekoe, 1998 ), presumably as a reasonable com-
promise between acid loss through evaporation and metal dissolution.

blended with (1.5 t CaCl 2+ 1.5 t MgCl 2)/t ore and roasted at 650 °C for 6 h, then leached in 6, 3 and 1 M HCl respectively. Tests 4, 5 and 6 denote ore blended with
(500 kg CaCl 2+ 500 kg MgCl 2)/t ore and roasted at 650 °C for 6 h, then leached in 6, 3 and 1 M HCl respectively. Tests 7, 8 and 9 denote ore blended with (250 kg
CaCl 2+ 250 kg MgCl 2)/t ore and roasted at 650 °C for 6 h, then leached in 6, 3 and 1 M HCl respectively.

171Therefore, the optimum operation temperature should be decided in
industry operations.
4.2.6. E ﬀect of stirring speed
The in ﬂuence of stirring speed on PGMs leaching was studied at
140, 280, 420 and 600 rpm in solution containing 6 M HCl at 90 °C and
5%w/v pulp density. The dissolution of platinum and palladium at
these stirring speeds was almost 100% within 3 h. The leaching kinetics
did not appear sensitive to agitation speed, i.e. di ﬀusion control played
an insigni ﬁcant role in the process. However, in all subsequent ex-
periments, the stirring speed was kept at 600 rpm to be sure that mi-
neral particles were brought into adequate contact with leaching re-
agents, which eliminates internal and external mass-transfer
resistances.
4.2.7. E ﬀect of solid-to-liquid ratio
As solid-to-liquid ratio ranged from 1 to 25%w/v ( Table 3), the
dissolution of both platinum and palladium decreased from approxi-
mately 100% to 0 and 5.07%, respectively; which was due to the gra-
dual decrease of residual acid concentration. In other words, the de-
creased extraction was caused by the decrease of acid available per unit
of solid. From the results given, 5%w/v was considered as the optimal
pulp density.
The relative concentration of most relevant species in the leachate
generated in the experimental program at 5%w/v solid-to-liquid ratio is
displayed in Table 4. PGM concentrations are very low as compared to
the elevated concentrations in leach liquors from UG-2 concentrate(59.4 mg/L Pt and 37.2 mg/L Pd) reported by Green et al. (2004) or
62.5 g/L Pt and 31.85 g/L Pd from Impala plant leach tests reported byAsamoah-Bekoe (1998) . As such from an economic point of view, it is
therefore imperative to leach a concentrate instead of the raw run-of-mine ore.
4.3. Chemical and mineralogical characterization
To identify chemical-mineralogical changes brought by the molten
salt chlorination-leach tests, fresh raw ore, chlorinated calcines and
solid leach residues were analysed by means of XRF, XRD, SEM and/or
Tescan Integrated Mineral Analysis (TIMA GM Model) operated by theJohn de Laeter Centre at Curtin University.
It was shown that thermal treatment signi ﬁcantly changes the ore
structure. New phases were observed even on simply heating the ore at650 °C without any reagent addition ( Table 5). Owing to the highly
hygroscopic nature of charges (physically observed) to quantitative X-ray diﬀraction (QXRD) analysis, large numbers of unidenti ﬁed peaks
were observed, as such results in Table 5 should be regarded as in-
dicative.
SEM examination also con ﬁrmed that new phases or solid solutions
formed during the tests. Backscattered electron micrograph of the raw
ore in Fig. 8A shows light grey areas corresponding to chromite mi-
neral, whereas the dark grey are siliceous gangue.
However, the molten-like morphology of the calcine salt product in
Fig. 8 B and 8C as well as the leach residue ( Fig. 8D) showed the for-
mation of new products (new solid phases) attributable to the decom-
position and reordering of the ore spinel structure to accommodate
atoms that comprise the reaction products ( Table 5 ).
It can also be seen ( Fig. 8C) that the main reaction product formed
during the chlorination process is composed of two distinct textural
patterns (variants) with dense chromite particles removed from the
spinel structure (Light grey areas) in association with other Mg, Ca, Al,
Cl, etc. (Dark grey areas) intimately mixed in solid solutions.
4.4. Plausible reaction mechanism
In contrast to Mwase and Petersen (2017) 's assumption of the oxi-
dation states of Pt and As in PtAs
2, which they assumed to be
Pt(2+)As(3−),Bai et al. (2017) stated that the formal oxidation state of
Pt in sperrylite is 4+ and that of As is 2 −; however, the As oxidation
state in the sul ﬁde melt may be di ﬀerent. Hence based on the above
analyses and observation, a plausible reaction mechanism is that the in-
situgenerated Cl 2attacks Pt surface to form PtCl 4shown in Eq. (7).
PtCl 4is reported to dissociate on cooling to form PtCl 2and Cl 2(Eq.(8)).
Regarding chemical leaching, literature reports that−PtCl42forms
mainly in aqueous chloride solutions (Eq. (17)), while−PtCl62forms (Eq.
(18)) in chloride solutions ( Mpinga et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2015;
Pospiech, 2012 ).
PtCl 2+ 2HCl→H2PtCl 4 (17)
PtCl 2+ 2HCl + Cl 2→H2PtCl 6 (18)
The residual free chlorine content present in the roasted product is
expected to (1) provide high oxidation potential, and more importantly
(2) to saturate the leaching solution (with chlorine), thereby converting
tetrachloroplatinic(II) acid, H 2PtCl 4to hexachloroplatinic acid H 2PtCl 6
(Gulliver and Levason, 1982 ). The possibility of forming Pt-M alloys
(where M = Ca, Mg, Ba, Ni, Fe and/or Cu) during the roasting processcan be completely excluded, as the experimental conditions were not
suﬃciently reducing ( Horike et al., 2012; Yeates and Somorjai, 1983).
Thus, the hypothesized mechanism is schematically described in Fig. 9.
Since the predominant species of platinum in the leaching solution
under investigation is expected to be
−PtCl62, which is more readily
extractable by weak-base anion exchange resins as exploited by MpingaTable 3

173shrinking model (Eqs. (9)–(13)) to the kinetic data. From the slopes,
diﬀerent rate constant (k) values were calculated ( Table 6).
An Arrhenius plot was constructed to determine the activation en-
ergy of the process ( Fig. 10 ). It was found that the activation energy of
platinum dissolution at 5%w/v in 6 M HCl to be 46 kJ/mol, indicating a
surface chemical controlled mechanism.
5. Conclusions
A detailed experimental program was undertaken to solubilize Cu,
Ni, Pt and Pd from a PGM-bearing chromite ore from an oxidized
mineralization. Two treatment routes including single-stage and
two-stage leach are presented in this paper. The hybrid pyro-
hydrometallurgical and low-temperature single-stage molten salt
(CaCl 2/MgCl 2) chlorination technique proved successful for simulta-
neously and e ﬃciently enable leaching of all target metals without the
need and/or addition of further oxidizing agents. Using cheap and
readily available reagents (routinely used for snow and ice control on
roadways), the process typically entailed roasting operation at 650 °C
for 6 h residence time, resulting in almost complete chlorination with
the formation of intermediate PGM products which further react with
aqueous HCl to give chlorocomplex ions in solution.
For an optimum performance, the key success of the process resides
in roasting in a specially designed reactor (e.g. an atmospheric pressure
reactor that is at least well sealed) to enhance the dispersion of the in-
situgenerated Cl 2into the cured ore. Such reactor would need to have
the option to control the extent of chlorination achieved.
Pyrohydrolysis of chloride salts and chlorine partial pressure were both
important factors in the leaching reaction of PGMs. Using intermediate
crushed ore (P 80=3 0 μm), excellent leach bene ﬁciation was achieved
averaging 99.71% Pt and 100% Pd with relatively low co-extraction ofdeleterious chromium (0.31%). Therefore, it appears high Cr content
can be allowed in the ﬂotation concentrate without adversely a ﬀecting
PGM recovery.
Treatment of concentrates is highly recommended in preference to
raw run-of-mine ore for increasing PGMs concentration in the leachateto a level that would be more attractive for commercial applications.
Ideally the technique can use a rougher ﬂotation product at high mass
pull e.g. 10% as compared to the usual 2% –a considerable amount of
ore weight will be rejected –thus reducing separation costs and saving
valuable minerals (e.g. sperrylite) that may be lost during further
cleaner stages. Grinding ﬁner than 30 µm was not necessary. With the
development of this technique, substantial PGM recoveries from oxideand mixed oxide/sul ﬁde ores are now possible. The technique isexpected to be a direct treatment route from ﬂotation concentrate to 
PGM reﬁnery feed.
The dissolution rate of PGMs is high  enough  to be considered for 
practical implementation in agitated reactors. These can be recovered 
from the pregnant solution, preferably before copper and nickel, by 
using highly PGM selective ion-exchangers. Resin-in-pulp (RIP) would 
be an attractive option, in order to avoid the solid/liquid separation and 
the unavoidable soluble losses of PGMs. The addition of SCN− to the 
iron chloride containing leachate (ligand exchange reaction) serves as a 
preconcentration step for trace PGM components prior to their re-
covery, and enhances the formation of various ferric cationic complexes 
that are not extractable by anion exchange resins.

Platinum Group Metals (PGMs), often with associated gold, have very few occurrences where they are
present in an ore deposit at economically extractable levels. They are classiﬁed as both precious andcritical metals due to their scarcity and their wide industrial use. With deteriorating socio-political
environments in most primary PGM producing countries, PGM deposits that are smaller but in less risky
jurisdictions have to be evaluated. However, the lower PGM grades, increased mineralogical complexityof the ores, capital intensity and strict environmental regulations in other international jurisdictions,
limit the implementation of conventional metallurgical processing options, particularly smelter-based
operations. The conventional smelter-based process options are justiﬁable for high grade, low chromite,large resource and long life-of-mine operations.
In the present paper, we review some of the most recent literature on the predominantly hydrometal-
lurgical approaches
to PGM extraction. A number of metallurgical processes that generate either a PGM
rich leachate or a residue containing metal values, and the various methods in use for their recoveriesfrom pregnant rich solutions are reviewed. Sixteen process ﬂowsheet variants combining conventional
and proprietary unit process technologies are provided, and their process chemistries and key technical
operating parameters are compared. Where appropriate, the key thermodynamic and kinetic factors aregiven and compared.

1. Introduction
The members of the Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) [platinum
(Pt), palladium (Pd),
iridium (Ir), osmium (Os), rhodium (Rh),
ruthenium (Ru)] plus gold (Au) are called ‘‘precious’’ metals
(PMs). Platinum, palladium and gold are of major commercial sig-
niﬁcance. Rhodium is the next most important, while iridium and
ruthenium are traded in moderate quantities. Osmium is rarely
used ( Fact Sheet, 2012; Harjanto et al., 2006 ). The PGMs have very
high melting points, are chemically inert to a wide variety of sub-
stances (even at very high temperatures), and thus resist corrosion.
They also have excellent catalytic properties, and are widely used
in the chemical industry and in automobile catalytic converters
(Afolabi et al., 2012). According to ﬁgures published by Miezitis
(2014) , gross demand for platinum and palladium fell marginally
in 2012 to 8.05 and 9.90 Moz, respectively. Over the last ﬁve years,
between 72% and 77% of total annual platinum supply has come
from primary mining output, the rest being originated from the
recycling ( WPIC, 2014 ). The amounts and principal locations from
which PGMs have been mined as a primary product and/or recov-ered as a by-product of base–metal mining from 1995 through
2010 are shown in Fig. 1 .
The major portion of platinum and palladium produced today
from primary sources 
originates from the Bushveld Igneous
Complex in South Africa. The most important reefs mined are theMerensky, Upper Group Two (UG-2) and Platreef (Cramer, 2001 ).
Ore grades range from 3 to 8 g/t PGM, with associated nickel andcopper in the 0.1–0.2% range present mainly as sulﬁdes
(Kyriakakis, 2005 ). South Africa dominates the PGMs world pro-
duction followed by Russia with minor contributions fromCanada, Zimbabwe, the USA and Colombia. South Africa, Russia
and Canada have approximately 98% of the known global PGM
reserves.
Platinum group metals are conventionally recovered from high-
grade concentrates (typically
assay of 200 to over 2000 g/t PGM
with 0.4–2.8% Cr 2O3) by the traditional matte–smelting–reﬁning
technique depicted in Fig. 2 (Cole and Joe Ferron, 2002 ). Ore is ﬁrst
ground by conventional multistage crushing and ball milling, or bysemi-autogenous grinding (SAG), and then smelted. The matte is
hydrometallurgically treated to leach and separate Fe, Co, Ni and
Cu leaving a slime containing 10–50% of precious metals (Chen
and Huang, 2006 ). Note that ﬂotation of conventional chromite
rich ores is usually done in a mill-ﬂoat–mill-ﬂoat (MF2) open cir-
cuit, to prevent the accumulation of chromite ﬁnes derived from
overgrinding in recirculating loads.
Just to mention a few, sizeable PGM resources with more
chromite challenging mineralogi 
es have been identiﬁed in
Finland and Australia ( Wilburn, 2012 ). The Penikat and Portimo
intrusions in northern Finland have generated the most interest
(Gold Field’s Arctic Platinum project or Suhanko). Suhanko can be
described as palladium/platinum deposits (average ratio of
approximately 4–1) with some signiﬁcant base–metal by-products
(Wilburn and Bleiwas, 2004 ). Total mineral resources in the Arctic
Platinum Project, including the SK Reef, currently stand at 168.3million tons containing 12.60 million ounces (Pt + Pd + Au) at a 
grade of 2.33 g/t, and include 330,000 tons of copper and 
140,000 tons of nickel (Saari, 2005 ). The three major Australian 
PGM deposits (i.e., Munni Munni, Panton and Fiﬁeld) contain a 
total of 100,460 kg PGM, which captures at least 80–90% of 
Australia’s known resources (Koek et al., 2010 ). Fig. 3 shows vari-
ous PGM projects in ‘‘friendly’’ (i.e. low socio-political risk) mining 
jurisdictions with their resource size and PGM grade (Trickey, 
2010 ). It is quite clear that most deposits are fairly small (less than 
100 million tons of ore, with intermediate (1 g/t < grade < 5 g/t) 
grades. It highlights that most of the resources in friendly mining 
jurisdiction do not have the resource base to warrant a smelter 
complex.
The features that these deposits (Finnish and Australian) tend 
to have in common are that they are characterized by relatively 
high Cr content (Lewins, 2006; Saari, 2005 ). However, with high 
chrome levels of more than 2.8%, pyrometallurgical processes 
are not attractive  on account  of the build-up of highly refractory 
chromite spinel layers in the furnace. In addition, the combina-
tion of high chromite, high talc and ﬁneness of grind of PGM con-
centrates have led to dangerously high matte temperatures 
(Eksteen, 2011; Eksteen et al., 2011; Ritchie and Eksteen, 2011). 
Another  major problem with smelting is the environmental costs 
due to the high pollution level from this traditional technology as 
environmental standards continue to stiffen, particularly regard-
ing toxic wastes such those with cyanide compounds.
A few of these new projects outside Southern Africa (see Fig. 4) 
may contribute to further growth in platinum industry. In the pre-
sent paper, we review some of the most recent literature on the 
topic, with a view to providing the full scope of developments in 
the ﬁeld.
2. Remote PGM deposits in friendly jurisdictions: A Western 
Australian example
According to Miezitis (2014) , the total identiﬁed PGM resources 
in Australia are about 276,000 kg (shallow deposit). Of this 
amount, deposits that have only PGM resources account for about 
51%. Australia’s annual platinum and palladium production 
equates to less than 0.2% of global supply (about 700 kg a year) 
with all production being a by-product of mining nickel sulﬁde 
deposits in the Yilgarn Craton in Western Australia. Australia 
remains poorly explored with regard to PGMs. No resource is being 
exploited for PGMs as the main (economic) product. Australia can 
make a larger contribution if it can ﬁnd ways to economically 
exploit its smaller stranded deposits.
PGM ore from the Panton Sill deposit, a Bushveld-type deposit in 
the Kimberley region of Western Australia, contains 2.19 g/t Pt, 2.39 
g/t Pd associated with 0.31 g/t Au, 0.27% Ni, and 0.07%Cu – 
providing sufﬁcient tonnage: design capacity of 1500 kg/year of 
recoverable PGMs – is currently being evaluated for precious 
metals recovery. The PGMs occur as discrete phases with most 
grain diameters in the 3–11 lm range, typically at particle 
boundaries or as locked inclusions hosted by silicates, carbonates94 C.N. Mpinga et al. / Minerals Engineering 78 (2015) 93–113and chromitites. The main palladium phase is palladium anti-
monide while sperrylite (platinum di-arsenide) is the main plat-
inum phase. The predominant base metal sulﬁdes were identiﬁed
(Lewins and Greenaway, 2004 ) as pentlandite, chalcopyrite and
pyrite.
The ﬁne grained nature of the PGMs and the presence of
signiﬁcant soft,
ﬁne grained altered silicates leads to a high
ﬂotation mass pull (i.e. concentrate to ore ratio) requirement in
order to achieve acceptable PGM grade recoveries. This in turn,
results in grade dilution and poor quality concentrates which
cannot be economically processed by PGM smelters, in addition
to large transport costs should concentrate transport be consid-
ered. The resource is not sufﬁciently large to justify the building
of a smelter at site, and the area is very poorly serviced with power
and water infrastructure.
Panton ﬂotation recoveries of about 65% into a ﬁnal concentrate
ofaround
100 g/t PGM combined with high chrome levels of more
than 5% means that the product is unattractive to smelters (Lewins,2006 ).The ratio of PGMs to each other being palladium rather than
platinum
rich (compared to South African and Zimbabwean ores)
implies a
lower income than for a Southern African ore of similar
total PGMs. Note that for South African producers, the approximate
distribution of the operating costs for each stage is as follows: 72%
mining, 10% concentrating, 9% smelting and 9% reﬁning (Jones,
2005 ).
Due to its (concentrate) relatively low sulfur content, and
because the
resource is too far away from a market, sulfuric acid
manufacture tends to be uneconomic. Conversely, the sulfur con-tent is still sufﬁciently high to cause signiﬁcant environmental
impact and therefore, has to be scrubbed using fairly expensive
ﬂue gas desulfurisation technologies such as dual alkaline scrub-
bing technology to produce a mixture of CaSO
3and CaSO 4
(Bezuidenhout et al., 2012; Eksteen et al., 2011). This adds signiﬁ-
cant capital and operating costs to smelting of chromite-rich PGM
concentrates.

144 kg CO 2equivalents, 0.45 kg SO 2and consumes roughly
753 m3of water per ton of ore milled ( Anglo American, 2011 ).
Furthermore, the lengthy overall ﬂowsheet results in unavoidable
PGM losses ( Chen and Huang, 2006 ).Jones (2005) argued that
PGMs recovery is typically about 85% in the concentration stage,95–98% in smelting and 99% in reﬁning. An alternative process to
recover PGMs has been proposed by other researchers where
PGMs are leached into an aqueous cyanide solution, in which they
are solubilized as precious metal-cyanide complexes (Mwase et al.,
2014; Chen and Huang, 2006; Aguilar et al., 1997; Trexler et al.,
1990 ).
Cyanidation has been the predominant process for gold recov-
eryfrom
mineral resources for more than a century because of
its simplicity and economy (Deschenes, 2005; Staunton, 2005;
Holtum and Murray, 1994; McInnes et al., 1994 ). In some instances
– the case for many oxide ores – gold and silver are leached directlyfrom ores/concentrates ( Prasad et al., 1991 ). In other occurrences,
such as precious metals bearing sulﬁde ores, the ores are oftentoo refractory to direct cyanide leaching even after ﬁne grinding.
The refractoriness of precious metal ores/concentrates to conven-
tional cyanide leaching can be related to carbonaceous materials
presence (preg-robbing activity), precious metals association with
sulﬁde minerals, and silica encapsulation (Senanayake, 2004a;
Wan et al., 1993 ).
In such cases, it is essential to pre-treat the ore/concentrate by
roasting, pressure
oxidation, bio- or chemical oxidation, or
mechanical activation to degrade carbonaceous materials or oxi-dize sulﬁde materials ( Ellis et al., 2008; Senanayake, 2004b;
Prasad et al., 1991 ). The precious metals are thereby released for
recovery during subsequent cyanide leaching whilst destroying
potential cyanicides such as base metal sulﬁdes (Wan and LeVier,
2011; Lorenzen and van Deventer, 1992; Afenya, 1991 ).
Many recent research and development activities have focussed
onprecious
metals extraction from refractory low-grade ore/con-
centrate using predominantly hydrometallurgical technologiesdue to increasing industrial need for these metals, the cost and
infrastructure requirements associated with smelting, the smaller
resource sizes outside of South Africa and Russia, and their limited
sources ( Liddell and Adams, 2012; Dreisinger, 2012; Chen and
Huang, 2006 ). The Polokwane smelter (in South Africa) is one of
the most recently installed and has been designed to accommodate
a higher UG-2 content with 4% Cr
2O3in the feed, throughput of
650,000 tonnes per year at 85% availability (87 t/h) (Liddell et al.,2010 ).
As in the processing of copper–gold and refractory sulﬁde
hosted gold 
ores, where the base metals and sulfur have to be
removed to expose the precious metals for extraction and to limit
reagent consumption, PGMs have to be made accessible to interact
with the lixiviant by removing the Cu and Ni sulﬁdes (chalcopyrite
and pentlandite); and converting iron sulﬁdes (pyrrhotite and pyr-
ite) into a form that does not lock up PGMs. These base metal
removal technologies are reviewed below.
3. Existing technologies in the extractive metallurgy of low-
grade refractory
precious metals
There are many publications reviewing copper and/or nickel
hydrometall urgy
or the combination pyro-hydrometallurgy pro-
cesses as a pre-treatment step toward PGM recovery from
ores/concentrates (Li et al., 2013; Li and Miller, 2006; Wang,
2005; Xiao and Laplante, 2004; Fleming, 2002; Maurice and
Hawk, 1999; La Brooy et al., 1994 ). However, the exact chalcopyrite
leaching mechanism is not proven, the ﬁnal ﬂowsheet (universalprocess) for its treatment from ores/concentrates is still notdetermined. To date chalcopyrite leaching has not been widelyadopted by industry due to its extremely slow leach kinetics (Li
etal.,
2013 ).
Many authors have suggested that the leaching process is inhib-
itedby
the formation of a passivating layer that does not allow fur-
ther reaction to occur, but there is no scientiﬁc consensus on theactual layer composition neither on its formation mechanism (Li
et al., 2013; Mateos et al., 1987 ). Three possible causes for this
phenomenon have been identiﬁed: (1) adherent ﬁlm formation of
sulfur (S
0), disulﬁde (S2/C0
2) and/or polysulﬁde (S2/C0
n) on the mineral
particle surface, which reduces the diffusion of the leaching agent
to the mineral reacting surface, (2) the formation of a copper rich
polysulﬁde layer developed on the surface as a result of solid state
changes that occur in the mineral during leaching and (3)
formation of impermeable layer comprised of Fe hydroxy-oxide
compounds ( Debernardi et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013; Nazari and
Asselin, 2009 ).
Therefore discussion in the present section will be mainly
limited to
chalcopyrite ores/concentrates treatment, since chal-
copyrite is both one of the precious metals hosting minerals and
the most difﬁcult to leach (refractory). Thereby any chalcopyrite
successful process will be hopefully capable of treating pentlandite
which is also refractory (Maurice and Hawk, 1999 ). In the follow-
ing sections, processes are grouped according to whether or notPGMs and/or gold are (is) leached into solution at ﬁrst solid–
lixiviant contact (single step leaching) or remain concentrated in
the insoluble leach residue, calcine/roaster products following
the pre-oxidation step until further hydrometallurgical treatment.
3.1. Precious metal rich solution processes
Hydrometallurgical treatments – generally have greater ﬂexi-
bility during
the process scale and control – are making inroads
into the ﬁeld traditionally dominated by smelting and reﬁning.
Milbourne et al. (2003) stated that a direct hydrometallurgical
treatment route from ﬂotation concentrate to reﬁnery feed isdesired by the industry to provide the beneﬁts of reduced treat-
ment charges, lower working capital, and better metal winning
economy at mine-site scale, as well as greater marketing ﬂexibility
for the product.
3.1.1. Chloride-based atmospheric leach process: Intec Copper process
The Intec Copper process is a proven, patented hydrometallur-
gical technolo
gy for copper and precious metals extraction from
sulﬁde concentrates ( Moyes and Crescent, 1999 ). The process
involves multistage leaching (in countercurrent conﬁguration)and uses a strong mixed chloride–bromide lixiviant (280 g/L NaCl
and 28 g/L NaBr), where chalcopyrite is leached by cupric ions
and air at atmospheric pressure and temperatures below 100 /C176C
(typically 85 /C176C) forming a solution of cuprous ions. At the same
time, sulﬁde and iron are rejected into the leach residue as elemen-
tal sulfur and hematite (Eqs. (1)–(3) ) rather than an unstable jaro-
site ( Palmer and Johnson, 2005; Sammut and Welham, 2002 ). The
main basic approaches of the process are depicted in Fig. 5 .

Intec process removes copper minerals (cyanicides) prior to
cyanidation-CIP/CIL. However, sulfur is renowned for passivatingprecious metals surfaces, leading to poor subsequent leach
recoveries ( Li et al., 2013; Nazari et al., 2011; Pugaev et al., 2011;
Córdoba et al., 2008 ). Then sulfur reacts with cyanide to form96 C.N. Mpinga et al. / Minerals Engineering 78 (2015) 93–113alkaline thiocyanate, which is ineffective in alkaline leaching and
only leads to cyanide consumption. Typical Intec Copper process
leach residue would be expected to contain around 32% of elemen-
tal sulfur ( Sammut and Welham, 2002 ). Note that gold dissolution
is an integral feature of the Intec Copper process. It appears thatthe chloride–bromide mixture (oxidant) is strong enough allowing
gold extraction to a high extent even in the presence of elemental
sulfur. Nevertheless according to Milbourne et al. (2003) , redox
potential (of >650 mV) and solution pH control are required to
achieve low sulfur oxidation with high PGM dissolution.
Precious metals recovery in the Intec Copper process can be
achieved by 
ion exchange, or reduction (i.e. cementation) using
recycled metallic copper dendrites. Aylmore (2005) has suggested
gold recovery through precipitation, as the solution potential will
drop to less than 800 mV (vs. SHE) after leaching. It is worth
mentioning that the presence of chloride–bromide lixiviant, an
effective electron-transfer agent, relaxes the tight particle size
requirement (as compared with other processes) to about P 80of
40lm. Finally, according to Sammut and Welham (2002) , the
Intec Copper process is suitable for commercial application and
the process has been run at the demonstration plant scale
(Milbourne et al., 2003 ).
3.1.2. Sulfate-based pressure leach process: Platsol/C210process
Chalcopyrite does not leach effectively at temperatures below
40/C176Cdue
to passivating layer formation on the unreacted materialsurface, preventing or slowing further leaching (Mwase et al.,
2012b ). Several acid sulfate-based leach processes were developed
to overcome the slow chalcopyrite leaching rate. These include,
among others, pressure leaching at two general temperature
regimes of 150 and 220 /C176C. The former regime is called ‘‘partial oxi-
dation’’ with elemental sulfur formation and the latter is called ‘‘to-tal oxidation’’ with complete oxidation of the sulfur to sulfate
(Wang, 2005 ).
The Platsol
/C210is a single step pressure leaching process devel-
oped at SGS (formerly Société Générale de Surveillance) byInternational PGM Technologies, to recover platinum group metals,
gold and base metals such as Cu, Ni and Co from a variety of high
and low-grade ores, concentrates, mattes, auto-catalysts and other
industrial products (Fleming, 2002 ). The Platsol
/C210process is a high-
temperature (>200 /C176C) pressure oxidation ( /C24700 kPa O 2, 3200 kPa
total pressure) sulfate-based process with additions of 5–20 g/L
NaCl to promote PGM minerals dissolution (Milbourne et al.,
2003 ). The process is schematized in Fig. 6 .
Under the above conditions, base metals (Cu, Ni) and precious
metals (Au,
Pt, Pd) are co-dissolved in a single step (Liddell and
Adams, 2012; Cole and Joe Ferron, 2002 ). Note that the total
oxidation conditions are effective for base metals extraction and
chloride addition allows the simultaneous precious metals extrac-
tion. Base metal sulﬁdes are oxidized with oxygen to soluble metal
sulfate complexes and sulfuric acid, while gold and PGMs are sol-
ubilized as chloro complexes ( Fleming, 2002 ). This is illustrated

The PGMs and gold are then recovered from the pregnant rich solu-
tion using either sulﬁde precipitation, activated carbon adsorption,

The Platsol/C210process is a variant of the high temperature Total
Pressure Oxidation (TPOX) discussed later in Section 3.2.4 , point
B. The fundamental difference between the two processes is the
chloride ions addition in sulfuric medium to the autoclave feed
in the Platsol/C210process ( Fleming, 2002 ).Liddell and Adams (2012)
pointed out that the Platsol/C210process disadvantages include poten-
tial incomplete PGM leach recoveries from more refractory mineral
phases and carry-over losses of precious and base metals at the
metals separation and recovery stages, due to co-precipitation
and adsorption effects. The majority of iron present in the concen-
trate is rejected into the residue, thereby effecting the solid–liquid
separation ( Milbourne et al., 2003 ). In addition, with the Platsol/C210
process, it is difﬁcult to optimize the conditions independentlyfor each value metal species, to maximize their dissolution and
recovery.
Ferron et al. (2006) have observed
 that most PGMs and their
minerals were amenable to the Platsol/C210process with the notable
exception of cooperite (PtS). Cooperite is generally known to bemore refractory than sperrylite (PtAs
2) minerals ( Adams et al.,
2011 ).Ferron et al. (2006) also observed that concentrates amen-
able to the Platsol/C210process are those containing high sulﬁde and
iron values. Platsol/C210leaching technology on Panton concentrates,
from Platinum Australia Limited, recorded 95% PGM dissolutionbut with unacceptably high reagent consumption presumably
caused by co-leaching of other feed constituents (Lewins and
Greenaway, 2004 ). The effective Panton concentrates leaching
may be attributed to the presence of native metals and metal alloyssuch as Pt–Fe, Pd–Cu–Fe, Pt–Pd–Fe, Pt–Fe–Ni and Pd–Pb along with
other PGM sulﬁdes, antimonides, bismuth, etc.
Similar technology used at Mintek (Green et
 al., 2004 ), in an
attempt of recovering Pd (23 g/t) from a material derived from a
sulﬁdic ore, gave recoveries between 40% and 50%. The authors
concluded that successful leaching requires satisfactory PGM grain
liberation and refractory minerals conversion (sulﬁdes, arsenides,
etc.) to native metals, alloys or amenable compounds. The technol-
ogy did not decompose PGM sulﬁdes. In the Platinum Australia
Limited’s work, it is assumed that PGM minerals were well liber-
ated (less refractory) based on the high recoveries observed.
Finally, according to Dreisinger (2006) , Platsol/C210technology is
under ﬁnal feasibility study for application by PolyMet Mining atthe NorthMet deposit in Minnesota, USA. Gold Fields Ltd. hasevaluated Platsol
/C210in their prefeasibility study for their Arctic
Platinum division consisting of the Suhanko, Narkaus and Penikatprojects (Gold 
Fields, 2013 ).
3.2. Precious metal rich residue processes
The precious metals are either concentrated in the insoluble
sulfuric acid
ﬁrst campaign leach residue, calcine or roaster prod-
ucts following the pre-oxidation step. Hence the solid residue is
the primary precious metals concentrate for further hydrometal-
lurgical treatment.
3.2.1. Cyanide-based atmospheric leaching
3.2.1.1. Sequential heap leach process. A low-cost hydrometallurgi-
calprocess
depicted in Fig. 7 , an alternative to smelting, consisting
of a heap bioleach process to ﬁrst extract the base metals (BMs);
followed by a caustic rinse of the residue material and a heap
cyanidation process to subsequently extract the PGMs, has been
suggested for treating low-grade ores/concentrates (Mwase et al.,
2014, 2012a,b ). Lonmin Plc has also developed and patented a
novel integrated hydrometallurgical method suitable to treatefﬁciently and economically low-grade PGM sulﬁde concentrates
with large amounts of chromite gangue (Bax et al., 2009 ).
A problem with this approach is that the residual solids follow-
ingoxidative
pre-treatment are frequently highly acidic, while the
cyanide leach process should be conducted at an alkaline solutionpH of more than 9.31, the optimum being 10.3 (Heinen et al.,1978 ). It is often advantageous to work at solution pH above the
HCN p K
avalue of 9.31 in order to prevent the formation of HCN
and its possible release, and pH > 9.3 ensures that most of the
cyanide is in its ionic form ( Fleming, 1992 ). As a consequence, it
is necessary to neutralize the solids prior to cyanide leaching(Mwase et al., 2012a,b ). This neutralization typically requires add-
ing large quantities of alkali to the solids, signiﬁcantly adding tothe expense and complexity of the operation such as material
handling ( Wan and LeVier, 2011; Senanayake, 2004b ).
Investigative experimental work by Platinum Australia Limited
(PLA) on
Panton concentrates (P 80of 38 lm) showed that atmo-
spheric cyanide leaching could recover up to 86% Pd, 99% Au, butless than 10% Pt. Fine grinding to P
80of 14 lm provided only small
improvement. It can be speculated that the low leachingtemperature might have contributed. Green et al. (2004) recorded
less than 25% PGMs recovery while leaching UG-2 ﬂotation con-centrate, presumably because only 30% of PGM grains were liber-
ated and 60% were associated with base metal sulﬁdes, mainly
pentlandite and chalcopyrite, either on edges or locked into base
metals. No single industrial operation using the current sequential
heap leach strategy has been reported.
3.2.1.2. Panton process. Platinum Australia Limited (PLA) in con-
junction with
Lonmin Plc have developed the Panton process, in
which low-grade ﬂotation concentrates are subjected to low-tem-
perature calcination followed by cyanide leaching at elevated tem-
perature to dissolve the PGMs, gold and base metals as per the

Lewins and Greenaway, 2004 ). Cyanide dissolved base and pre-
cious metals are recovered from the pregnant solution by precipi-
tation to produce high-grade base and precious metal concentrates
suitable as direct feed to reﬁneries (Bax, 2004 ).
On Panton Sill concentrates, the process recorded signiﬁcantly
higher recoveries
of 90.8% Pt, 91.9% Pd, 94.4% Au, 69% Cu and
32% Ni ( Lewins and Greenaway, 2004 ). Although roasting is
viable at relatively low temperatures of 275–550 /C176C, it requires
high capital expenditure to ensure good heat recovery.Furthermore, Sanders (1926) has argued that roasting or smelt-
ing PtAs
2to temperatures of 450 /C176C or more, arsenic turns from
its solid into the gaseous state thereby inducing platinum to do
likewise, hence escape into the atmosphere as a total loss.
Finally, the growing concern with environmental protection
increases the restriction on building new cyanide plants. No sin-
gle industrial operation using the Panton process has been
reported.3.2.2. Cyanide-based pressure leaching: Two-stage selective pressure
leach process
Huang et al. (2006) stated that the two-step hydrometallurgical
process depicted in Fig. 9 was able to handle concentrates contain-
ing low sulfur and high MgO. It is worth mentioning two case sce-narios: (1) in acidic pressure leaching, MgO neutralizes the
released acid from sulﬁde oxidation, reducing the leach solution
acidity and allowing the ﬂotation plant to produce a high MgO con-
centrate without a huge rejection of impurity fractions. This in turn
maintains high ﬂotation yield, i.e., metal recovery as talc (main
source of magnesium) does not have to be suppressed as much
during ﬂotation. (2) In case where a pyrometallurgical route is con-
sidered, magnesium and chromium have reduced solubility in
smelting slags at conventional temperatures due to the formation
of magnesium-iron-chromite spinel minerals (Fleming, 2002 ).
According to the process, precious metals in the iron residue
from pressure
acid leach can be leached by pressure cyanidation
following a caustic wash and solution pH adjustment.

Fig. 10. Simpliﬁed block ﬂow diagram of the Kell process.C.N. Mpinga et al. / Minerals Engineering 78 (2015) 93–113 99Investigative work by Platinum Australia Limited (PLA) showed
that pressure cyanidation could achieve only 60–69% PGM recov-
ery. Once again, besides this low PGM recovery, there are still
increased regulatory restrictions placed on cyanide use for leaching
operations due to toxicity and environmental concerns (Aylmore,
2005; Senanayake, 2004a ). In order to protect aquatic life species,
the Australian Water Quality Guidelines provide a trigger value of4
lg/L of ½CN/C0/C138(Cyanide management, 2008 ).
It is pertinent to mention Mwase et al. (2012b) who stated that
cyanide is proven to be the most effective and most environmen-
tally acceptable reagent due to the fact that it undergoes natural
oxidation converting it to CO 2and N 2. Note that HCN has a half-life
of 267 days after release into the atmosphere (Korte et al., 2000 ).
Furthermore, Mwase et al. (2012b) dealt with cyanide products
without differentiating their chemistry, and were thus probably
unaware of the interesting observation which Adams et al.
(2008) had made a few years earlier, that the presence of copper
in tailings supernatant tends to stabilize weak-acid dissociable
cyanide in a form toxic to wildlife yet less amenable to natural
degradation processes. The Romanian dam disaster, on 30th
January 2000 with serious consequences, might be used as an
example ( Korte et al., 2000 ). No single industrial operation using
the two-stage selective pressure leach process has been reported.
3.2.3. Chloride-based processes
3.2.3.1. Kell process. The Kell process is a patented hydrometallur-
gical alternativ
e to PGM smelting. This process is a mixed
chloride/sulfate based technology, where base metals are removed
by sulfuric acid pressure leaching and PGMs are leached after
roasting with Cl 2/HCl as commonly used in PGM reﬁning.
However, the solution concentrations of PGMs for the Kell processtend to be lower. According to Liddell et al. (2010) andTatarnikov
et al. (2004) , the technology is insensitive to the chromite content
in the feed. As depicted in Fig. 10 , the process comprises three
major unit operations including (1) an autoclave for oxidativeand selective pressure leaching of base metals and sulfur, (2) a
roasting pre-treatment step to render PGMs and particularly Pt
amenable to leaching and (3) chlorination of precious metals
(Adams et al., 2011 ). Dissolved precious metals are recovered from
the pregnant rich solution by adsorption onto ion exchange resinsthat are then incinerated to produce a ﬁnal high-grade PGM con-
centrate containing 80–85% PGMs plus gold (Liddell and Adams,
2012 ).
Criticisms of the Kell process are that Cl
2gas is highly corrosive
requiring special materials of construction and therefore results in
both high capital and operating costs if such technology is adopted.
The same arguments prevail for any chloride-based process. Liddell
and Adams (2012) have argued that chlorination leaching has
become a standard unit process in PGM reﬁneries. It is pertinentto mention that the reﬁnery is more the size of a large pilot scale
laboratory or a small pharmaceutical plant owing to the low vol-
ume of
feeds, usually with a monthly tonnage of 4–5 tonnes as
compared to the thousands of tonnes of low-grade concentratesto be processed if such technology was adopted (Mwase, 2009 ).
Furthermore, the long-term materials performance is not as wellproven. Finally, one of the challenges for all PGM reﬁneries, when
evaluating new routes, is the introduction of more contaminants
such as S, Se, Te, Bi, Cr, Hg, Si, and Pb. These contaminants are often
not sufﬁciently well evaluated during the process development.
The Kell process has not yet been applied commercially. Pilot-scale
testing and engineering study work are in progress for several
selected sites (Liddell and Adams, 2012).
3.2.3.2. Outokumpu HydroCopper
/C210process. The HydroCopper/C210pro-
cess (chloride-based leaching process) developed by Outokumpu
Technology in Finland, involves countercurrent leaching of
chalcopyrite concentrates using air or oxygen and chlorine as
oxidants. Copper sulﬁde concentrate is leached in a strong NaCl
solution. In typical HydroCopper/C210technology, NaCl concentra-
tions are 230–280 g/L, solution pH can vary between 1.5 and2.5 and temperature between 80 and 100 /C176C, at atmospheric pres-
sure ( Lundström et al., 2005, 2009; Senanayake, 2009 ). Generally,
chalcopyrite leaching in chloride media, with Cu
2+as oxidant, is
more effective than in sulfate media with Fe3+as oxidant
(Lundström, 2009; Lundström et al., 2007 ). Cupric ion concentra-
tion should be greater than 9 g/L for successful operations(Lundström et al., 2005 ).
Copper goes into solution as Cu
+(Eq. (8)) while iron is precipi-
tated as hematite (Wang, 2005 ). According to Kowalczuk and
Chmielewski (2008) , the process is capable of leaching all kinds
of copper sulﬁde concentrates at atmospheric pressure and tem-
peratures of around 80–100 /C176C using stirred reactors, thickeners
and other conventional hydrometallurgical equipment.
CuFeS 2þCuCl 2þ3=4O2!2CuCl þ1=2Fe 2O3þ2S0ð8Þ
In this process, chlorine oxidizes Cu(I) to Cu(II) (Eq. (9)) and
copper is recovered from the puriﬁed leach solution by precipitat-ing cuprous oxide with caustic soda (Eq. (10)). Then, metallic
copper is produced by hydrogen reduction (Eq. (11)). The same
process produces and provides (Eq. (12)) all of the chlorine, sodium
hydroxide, and hydrogen needed to operate (Wang, 2005 ). Sulﬁde
sulfur is removed as elemental sulfur, chlorine and hydrogen gases
are recycled back to the process (Lundström, 2009 ). Gold is leached
at potentials of >800 mV (vs. SHE) and then recovered from thepregnant solution by precipitating it on activated carbon or
copper concentrate. Fig. 11 depicts the general HydroCopper

Chloride solutions offer the stability to monovalent copper
(cuprous ions precipitate only at solution pH > 9, cupric ions read-
ily precipitate at solution pH of 3–4) and sulfur reports to the
leaching residue in its elemental form compared with sulfuric acid
leaching, where copper and sulfur are oxidized to higher oxidation
stages of 2+ and 6+, respectively (Hyvärinen et al., 2004 ).
Nevertheless, one challenge in chloride media is the need for spe-cial construction materials due to their corrosive nature. The
HydroCopper
/C210chloride process has reached commercial maturity
scale in Mongolia and at the Morenci mine in Arizona (Turkmenand Kaya, 2009 ). However, the process has not been used to date
in conjunction with PGMs and copper–gold ores.
3.2.4. Sulfate-based leach processes3.2.4.1. Processes using partial pressure oxidation.
3.2.4.1.1. Cominco Engineering Services Ltd. process (CESL process).
The CESL process, schematized in Fig.12,
 is a hydrometallurgical
alternative to copper sulﬁde concentrates smelting. The process
was later expanded to include process development on other base
metals as well as precious metals recovery. The process is
composed of two leaching stages. The ﬁrst is a pressure oxidation
(150/C176C, 700 kPa O 2, 1100 kPa total pressure) with chloride
(12 g/L Cl/C0) as a catalyst to produce CuSO 4/C1Cu(OH) 2which is lea-
ched by sulfuric acid and, then the leaching residue is fed to the
second atmospheric leach (Eqs. (13) and (14)). Gold is recovered
from the residue by cyanidation following elemental sulfurremoval (using organic solvent: hot perchloroethylene), so that
cyanide consumption is reduced (Carneiro and Leão, 2007 ). Theprocess converts iron to hematite, and sulfur to elementalsulfur ( Wang, 2005 ).

Precious metals recovery from the residue would be complicated by
the elemental sulfur presence, which would tend to pick them up
from the pregnant rich leach solution rendering the approach
unattractive ( Milbourne et al., 2003 ). Note that this applies to a
number of processes mentioned earlier as well. According toDreisinger (2006) , the CESL technology has completed a feasibility
study for its application in copper process in Brazil.
3.2.4.1.2. The Anglo American Corporation/UBC process (AAC/
UBC). The Anglo American Corporation/University of British
Columbia (AAC/UBC)
copper process, presented in Fig. 13 , is a med-
ium temperature leach process for chalcopyrite concentrates. Theconcentrates are reground to ﬁne size (P
80of 5–20 lm) and
leached under moderate pressure (700 kPa O 2) at 150 /C176Ci na n
acid–sulfate system ( Dreisinger, 2006 ). Leaching of CuFeS 2at
150/C176C in the presence of elemental sulfur requires process
conditions that prevent coating of unreacted CuFeS 2by liquid sul-
fur and avoidance of passivation (melting point of sulfur is 125 /C176C).
The passivation is not necessarily totally removed. The problem is
addressed by either: (1) elemental sulfur removal before PGM
leaching or (2) interaction of PGM leaching reagents with
elemental sulfur.
Surfactant additives such as calcium lignosulfonate and ortho-
phenylen ediamine
can be used to disperse the molten sulfur.
However, depending on the amount of oxygen provided, sulﬁdesulfur in CuFeS
2may be oxidized to either elemental sulfur or to
sulfate according to the reactions in Eqs. (15) and (16) . High

gen consumption. A further major advantage is that a possible sale-
able by-product is produced instead of the sulfate, which requires
lime for neutralization. In addition, the cost of oxidizing the con-
centrate is only about 30% of that for the higher-oxygen demand
where sulfate is produced (Eq. (16)). Copper is recovered by con-
ventional SX-EW, while precious metals can be recovered by leach
residue cyanidation following elemental sulfur removal. The AAC/
UBC copper process has not yet been applied commercially. The
process has been evaluated in a continuous, fully integrated pilot
plant simulation test program (Dreisinger, 2006 ).

3.2.4.1.3. The Albion process. The Albion technology, schema-
tized in Fig.
14, was developed by Xstrata Plc to treat concentrates
produced from refractory base and precious metal ores. The tech-
nology is a sulfate based process employing ultraﬁne grinding
(P80of 10–15 lm) at temperatures of around 85–90 /C176C, atmo-
spheric pressure to accelerate the kinetics and increase copperrecovery level from chalcopyrite, in conventional agitated tanks
with corrosion resistant alloy steel shells (Nazari et al., 2012a;
Kowalczuk and Chmielewski, 2008; Ellis et al., 2008 ). The Albion
process is an auto-thermal operation, i.e. the leach slurry temper-ature is set by the amount of heat released in the leaching reaction.
Both the Albion and ActivOx
/C210processes make use of ultraﬁne
grinding to achieve sulﬁde dissolution (enhanced matrix attack)
at lower temperature and pressures than required by conventional
high pressure oxidation ( Ellis et al., 2008 ). Note that ﬁne grinding
produces particles with P 100of <38 lm while ultraﬁne grindingproduces particles sized within 1 and 20 lm range ( La Brooy
et al., 1994 ). Ultraﬁne grinding performs the same function as
roasting, pressure oxidation, bio- and chemical oxidation whichis to break down the sulﬁde matrix to liberate precious metals
locked in silicates or other minerals (Flatman et al., 2010 ).
According to Hourn et
 al. (2005) , ultraﬁne grinding of sulﬁde
minerals to particle size of 80% passing 8–12 lm will eliminate
mineral passivation by sulfur precipitates, as the leached mineral
will disintegrate prior to the precipitate layer becoming
thick enough to passivate it. The oxygen used for oxidation is
injected into the base of the Albion leach reactor at supersonic
velocity to achieve the required mass transfer and leaching rate.
Chalcopyrite is acid leached through ferrous ion oxidation
(Fe3+being the main oxidizing agent) by oxygen according to the
mechanism suggested by Hiroyoshi et al. (2001) in Eqs. (17) and
(18). Ferrous oxidation by oxygen takes place as in Eq. (19).

Copper is extracted via SX-EW to produce copper cathodes
(Kowalczuk and Chmielewski, 2008 ). Excess sulﬁde sulfur in chal-
copyrite leaching is present in the residue as elemental sulfur. This
makes precious metals recovery difﬁcult as S0can form a protec-
tive coating on the mineral particles. Once present, the coatingmay hinder the leaching process or even stop it completely.
Jeffrey and Anderson (2003) and Lu et al. (2000) have suggested
non-cyanide leaching methods such as sodium hydroxide toovercome elemental sulfur issues.

Fig. 15. ActivOx/C210process conceptual ﬂow schematic.102 C.N. Mpinga et al. / Minerals Engineering 78 (2015) 93–113Oraby and Eksteen (2013) have shown that one can leach cop-
per sulﬁdes (including chalcopyrite), oxides and native copper
effectively from a copper mineral–precious metal concentrate
using an alkaline glycine solution at pH of 10–11 with hydrogen
peroxide as oxidant. The copper glycinate solution can be treated
for copper recovery by a number of conventional technologies such
as precipitation using NaSH or solvent extraction. Elemental sulfur
formation is prevented by performing the oxidation in alkaline gly-
cine solution.
Hourn et al. (2005) have reported that Albion leach process can
operate under either acidic or alkaline conditions (see Fig. 14 ). In
the ﬁrst case (acid leach), base metals are extracted along with pre-cious metals as by-product, while in the second case; precious
metals encapsulated in pyrite, arsenopyrite, selenide or telluride
ores are alkaline leached with no requirement of recovering basemetals. The alkaline leach process of refractory precious metal
bearing sulﬁdes such as pyrite progresses through pyrite dissolu-
tion (Eq. (20)) to ﬁnally expose the precious metals for subsequent
cyanidation.

The Albion process is commercially operational at two plants
treating zinc sulﬁde concentrates that are located in Spain and
Germany, while a third Albion process plant operating in the
Dominican Republic is treating refractory gold/silver concentrates
(Turner and Hourn, 2013 ).
3.2.4.1.4. The ActivOx/C210process. The ActivOx/C210process (sulfate
based process), shown in Fig. 15 , is a low pressure oxidation tech-
nology developed to recover a range of base and precious metals
from sulﬁde ores and concentrates ( Palmer and Johnson, 2005 ).
The process incorporates ultraﬁne grinding – typically P 80of 5–
10lm to activate mineral surfaces – followed by a low-pressure
leach of around 1000 kPa O 2at low-temperature of 100–110 /C176C
to break down the sulﬁde matrix within a retention time of 1–
2h ( Gok and Anderson, 2013; Palmer and Johnson, 2005; La
Brooy et al., 1994 ). Matrix disintegration by high energy grinding
is also called ‘‘mechanical activation’’ ( Balaz et al., 2000; Maurice
and Hawk, 1999 ).
The total surface area increases by decreasing the initial mineral
particle size,
which leads to increasing internal and surface ener-
gies, decreasing the coherence energy of solids and ﬁnally increas-
ing copper extraction. The leaching temperature in this process is
lower than the sulfur melting point of 125 /C176C, hence surfactant
addition is not required. The oxidation reactions in the ActivOx/C210
process occur through reactions in Eqs. (21)–(23) .

Cu2SþO2þ2H2SO4!2CuSO 4þ2H2OþS0ð23Þ
Elemental sulfur formed in the process remains in the leaching
residue, which leads to difﬁculties in precious metals recovery.Base metals are recovered from the solution via solvent extraction,
while precious metals in the leach residue are recovered by
conventional cyanidation treatment following elemental sulfur
removal. Most of iron precipitates as goethite or hematite.
Problems have been noted in the prevention of magnesium and
calcium accumulation which would affect nickel solvent extraction
using versatic acid and copper electrowinning. Several researchers
(Lorenzen et al., 2009; Eksteen et al., 2008; Georgalli et al., 2008 )
have looked at partial calcium and magnesium removal usingammonium ﬂuoride to precipitated ﬂuorite (CaF
2) and sellaite
(MgF 2) with alumina based adsorption to remove excess ﬂuoride
ions. The ActivOx/C210process for copper was demonstrated at the
Tati Hydrometallurgical Demonstration Plant (THDP) in 2004(Palmer and Johnson, 2005 ).
3.2.4.1.5. The Nitrogen Species Catalyzed (NSC) process. Gok
(2010) stated that 
the basic principle underlying leaching with
oxy-nitrogen species is the recovery of valuable metals occludedwithin sulﬁde mineral grains in sub-microscopic form as inclusions
or in solid solutions, by oxidizing sulﬁde either to elemental sulfur
or sulfate with an oxidant and thereby destroying the sulﬁde lat-
tice. The NSC process is a sulfate leach system augmented with
2 g/L NaNO
2and operating under mild conditions such as 125 /C176C,
400 kPa O 2(Milbourne et al., 2003 ). The process does not require
excessively high temperatures or pressures, and has no corrosion
issues to deal with; hence commonly available stainless steel can
be used for the reactor vessel (Anderson, 2003 ).Fig. 16 illustrates
the simpliﬁed Nitrogen Species Catalyzed (NSC) process ﬂowsheet.
The complex chalcopyrite leaching chemistry in acidic nitrite
electrolyte is
shown in Eqs. (24) and (25) (Gok and Anderson,
2013 ).

From Table 1 it can be seen that NO+/NO couple is capable of an
extremely high redox potential compared to other well-known
redox couples.
During the leach process, in addition to NO (g)and NO 2(g), the
system may contain a number of other nitrogen compounds
(HNO 2,N2O4,N O/C0
2,N2O3, HNO 3,N O/C03, etc.) that have various cat-
alytic activities. Nitrous acid (HNO 2) has been predicted to be the
most kinetically reactive form (Gok et al., 2013 ). Previous work
done by Epstein et al. (1980) has indicated that the reaction
between nitric acid and nitric oxide products proceeds auto-cat-
alytically (Eq. (26)). Nitrogen species (oxidant) are continuously
regenerated in a closed vessel with an oxygen overpressure(Anderson, 2003 ).
ð26Þ
In the NSC process, precious metals can either be leached or
retained in the oxidized solids by controlling the chosen processconditions ( Milbourne et al., 2003 ). According to Anderson (2003) ,
gold leached by the alkaline sulﬁde system (this is used owing tothe elemental sulfur present in the residue solids) is readilyrecoverable by electrowinning, gaseous precipitation, chemical pre-
cipitation, cementation, solvent extraction, or ion exchange. The
Nitrogen Species
Catalyzed pressure leaching process (NSC) was
commissioned and performed successfully on an industrial scaleat Sunshine Precious Metals ( Gok and Anderson, 2013 ).
3.2.4.1.6. The ConRoast process. Mintek ( Jones, 2002 ) has
developed and piloted a patented process for the treatment ofnickel–copper–PGM sulﬁde concentrates with high chromite and
low sulfur content. The ConRoast process is based on sulfur
removal by ﬂuidized-bed roasting, followed by a reductive smelt-
ing of the dead-roasted (with low sulfur content) concentrate in
a DC arc furnace. The process uses an iron-based alloy as a collector
of nickel, copper, cobalt and PGMs rather than matte-based proce-
dure; because there is effectively no sulfur present at this stage of
the process (smelting). The smelted alloy is then atomized to
produce ﬁne particles sized between 20 and 100
lm, subjected
to hydrometallurgical acid leaching to remove the iron, extractthe base metals and leave a PGM rich ﬁnal concentrate suitable
as direct feed to PGM reﬁneries (Jones, 2009; Braemore resources
Plc., 2009; Phillips et al., 2008 ). The conceptual ﬂow schematic of
the process is depicted in Fig. 17 .
In order to avoid the commonly experienced problem of
magnetite or 
chromite spinel build-up in the furnace, this latter
is operated under quite strongly reducing conditions at high
temperatures averaging 1585 /C176C(Geldenhuys and Jones, 2009 ).
This constitutes its main disadvantage; as roasting, smelting, SO 2
gas scrubbing and neutralisation are required similar to conven-
tional smelting processes. Sulfur emissions are captured and

stream of sulfur dioxide gas, which is fed to a secondary plant to
produce sulfuric acid for use in downstream base metal leaching
operations ( Phillips et al., 2008 ). In the case of low-sulfur feed
materials, the gas is scrubbed and neutralized. Since October2007, Braemore has successfully treated low-PGM content, high-
chrome smelter feed at its ConRoast demonstration facilities using
Mintek’s DC arc furnace in Johannesburg, South Africa (Braemore
resources Plc., 2009 ).
3.2.4.2. Total Pressure Oxidation process (TPOX). The Total Pressure
Oxidation process has been developed by Placer Dome and theUniversity of
British Columbia (UBC). The process has no suitable
chelating agent. It uses water as leach medium and converts mostof the sulﬁde sulfur to copper sulfate and sulfuric acid (Milbourne
et al., 2003 ). The autoclave operates at typical conditions of 210–
220/C176C, with sparged oxygen to maintain 700 kPa overpressure
(Wang, 2005 ). Chalcopyrite oxidation occurs through the reaction
in Eq. (27), and the conceptual ﬂow schematic of the process is
shown in Fig. 18 .
CuFeS 2þ17=4O2þ1=2H2SO4!CuSO 4þ1=2Fe 2ðSO4Þ3þ1=2H2O
ð27Þ
The Total Pressure Oxidation process has the advantage of
rapid, complete copper recovery with high degree of iron
hydrolysis and impurity ﬁxation. Iron is rejected as a stable hema-
tite phase (Fe 2O3), which is one of the preferred hydrometallurgical
process residues ( Dreisinger, 2006 ). Hydronium jarosite is precipi-
tated as a co-product which will collect silver (if present) and othermonovalent cations via the reaction shown in Eq. (28) (Wang,
2005 ).

ð28Þ
Precious metals follow iron and report to the hematite residue
as an oxide or in elemental form. A secondary leach (cyanidation)is required to recover precious metals. The process is ideally suited
to copper–precious metal concentrates. This because all sulﬁdes
are oxidized to sulfate and no cyanide-consuming sulfur reports
to the residue, which would allow easy and economic precious
metals recovery. However, the process oxidizes all sulﬁde minerals
to sulfates and sulfuric acid (high oxygen consumption). Hence thecost associated with high maintenance and sulfate disposal may
become prohibitive, unless the copper/precious metals grade is
high enough 
to warrant such neutralisation expense (Nazari
et al., 2012a ).
The sulfuric acid must be used beneﬁcially for the process to be
commerc ially
viable since the cost of generating and neutralizing
this acid is prohibitively high ( Dreisinger, 2006; Marsden et al.,
2003 ). For instance the acid can be used for heap leaching
(Nazari et al., 2012c ). The Total Pressure Oxidation technology
has been implemented by Phelps Dodge at Bagdad,Arizona ( Dreisinger, 2006 ). It has also been successfully commer-
cialized at First Quantum’s Kansanshi Copper Operation inZambia ( Nazari, 2012).
3.2.5. Galvanically-assisted chalcopyrite leach process: Galvanox ™
The Galvanox™ process (galvanically-assisted atmospheric
leaching in
a ferric/ferrous sulfate medium) developed by Dixon
and Tshilombo (2005) for copper leaching from chalcopyrite, uses
galvanic contact between chalcopyrite (as both anode and cathode)and pyrite (as cathode for ferric reduction) under controlled condi-
tions (silver-activated pyrite as catalyst) to leach chalcopyrite con-
centrates at 80 /C176C(Nazari et al., 2012b,c ). The overall leaching
reaction is in Eq. (29) (Nazari et al., 2011, 2012a; Córdoba et al.,
2008; Kowalczuk and Chmielewski, 2008 ).
CuFeS 2þO2þ2H2SO4!CuSO 4þFeSO 4þ2H2Oþ2S0ð29Þ
Although ferric ion oxidizes the mineral sulﬁde, it may also be
responsible for its passivation, because high [Fe3+]/[Fe2+] ratios of
/C291 favor Fe3+precipitation and nucleation as jarosite on the chal-
copyrite surface and its later passivation (Córdoba et al., 2008 ).
Silver is preferentially incorporated into the jarosite structure to
form argentojarosite, AgFe 3(SO 4)2(OH) 6and loses its activity as cat-
alyst. This is one of the main drawbacks associated with the tech-nology (Nazari et al., 2012a ). In addition, silver is expensive and
would typically be avoided in practice as catalyst, unless the oresthemselves contained sufﬁcient silver. Finally, according to
Nazari (2012) , in this process PGM recovery is feasible through
cyanide or thiosulfate leaching of copper residues. TheGalvanox™ process has been evaluated in a continuous pilot plant
simulation test program ( Dreisinger, 2012; Nazari et al., 2012c ).

summary of existing technologies in the extractive metallurgy of
low-grade refractory precious metal sulﬁde ores and concentrates.
4. Use of unconventional lixiviants
Considerable research efforts have been made in investigating
alternatives to
cyanidation for gold. The non-cyanide systems that
have been considered include halogens, thiourea, thiosulfate,
thiocyanate and the newly developed alkaline glycine leach
(Oraby and Eksteen, 2014; Zhang et al., 2012; Li and Miller,
2006; Aylmore, 2005 ). Gold forms a large number of complexes
with these ligands such as AuCl/C0
4,A u½SCðNH 2Þ2/C138þ
2,A uðS2O3Þ3/C0
2,
AuðSCNÞ/C0
2, and Au ðNH 2CH 2COOÞ/C02. However, some of these alterna-
tive lixiviants have not been industrially tested on PGMs. It is the
aim of this part of the investigation to provide a status evaluation
of PGM leaching using the aforementioned lixiviants.
4.1. Alkaline glycine leach processes
The Western Australian School of Mines (WASM) at Curtin
University in
Perth, Western Australia has developed and patenteda hydrometallurgical method suitable to treat low-grade copper–
gold sulﬁde deposits ( Oraby and Eksteen, 2014). The amino-acid
lixiviant containing glycine and peroxide showed copper dissolu-tion of 98% within 48 h, at ambient conditions and solution pH of
10.5–11. The results also showed that 100% of chalcocite (Cu
2S),
cuprite (Cu 2O), metallic copper and about 80% of chalcopyrite
(CuFeS 2) in the concentrate were dissolved (Oraby and Eksteen,
2014 ). Pyrite (FeS 2) remained intact during the leaching time.
The alkaline glycine leach process is still in its infancy.
However ,
it does offer an attractive potential for treating low-
grade refractory ores and ﬂotation concentrates. It is an optimistic
hope that alkaline glycine leach may ﬁnd applications in the lower-
grade PGM deposits treatment by using heaps, dumps or in situ
leaching techniques similar to those practiced in the gold industry,since the leaching conditions are almost identical. Nevertheless,more work is needed to evaluate different metal recovery methods
and the possibility of regenerating and recycling the lixiviant.
4.2. Halide system (bromide, chloride and iodide) leach processes
Halide leaching includes bromide, chloride and iodide. They are
well known
lixiviants for gold, being used before the introduction
of cyanide ( Rosia, 2007 ). According to La Brooy et al. (1994) , chlo-
rination was practised in Australia as early as 1891. The halideTable 2

Dashes indicate datum not available.106 C.N. Mpinga et al. / Minerals Engineering 78 (2015) 93–113system offers high leaching rates (Zhang et al., 2012). However,
halogens have proved to be very reactive with other ore minerals,
especially sulﬁdes. Hence under typical halide-leaching conditions,
reagent consumptions would be very high if the ore contains sig-
niﬁcant sulﬁde minerals ( Aylmore, 2005 ). Halide system was lim-
ited to analytical applications and PGM reﬁneries, where thedissolution speed and capacity for simultaneous sulﬁde destruc-
tion are more important than reagent consumption.
4.2.1. Iodide leach processes of precious metals
Iodine forms the most stable gold complexes (see Table 3)
 of all
the halogens (Zhang et al., 2012 ).Prasad et al. (1991) stated that
iodine leaches gold from its ores at low concentrations and canpenetrate rocks particularly well. Solid iodine reacts with iodide
in aqueous solution to form triiodide ions (the major oxidant).
This then reacts with gold to give Au(I) rather than forming
Au(III) complex (Eqs. (30) and (31)). According to Aylmore
(2005) , Au(III) complex is not stable (E
ofor AuI/C0
2<AuI/C04), it oxi-
dizes iodide ion to iodine and Au(III) complex is reduced to Au(I).
La Brooy et al. (1994) found that gold leaching rates in iodide solu-
tions are much faster than conventional cyanidation. Typical iodidegold leaching conditions are 1 g/L I
2, 9 g/L NaI, solution pH of 4–9
and standard redox potential of about 336 mV (vs. SCE) (Sparrowand Woodcock, 1995 ).

Dawson and Kelsall (2007) have used Eh–pH diagrams to interpret
platinum and palladium dissolution behavior in halide solutions
including iodide, chloride and bromide. Selective PGM dissolution
in less acidic and aggressive conditions could be achieved by the
iodide system, as Pd(II/IV) and Pt(II/IV) stabilities regions covered a
wide solution pH range. The major platinum/palladium-iodide com-
plex ions under acidic conditions are PtI2/C0
6and PdI2/C0
4. The oxidation
and reduction reactions are presented in Eqs. (32)–(33) and (34) ,
respectively ( Jha et al., 2013; Zanjani and Baghalha, 2009 ).

No single industrial operation using iodide/iodine for PGM
leaching has been reported.
4.2.2. Chloride leach processes of precious metals
Chlorination was used extensively for pre-treating refractory
and carbonaceous
ores in several plants in the USA in the 1980s
(Aylmore, 2005 ). The leaching reaction with chlorine (oxidizing
agent) is very fast but, as with cyanide, the process is not selective
since almost all metals form very stable chloro complexes (Farinha
et al., 1992 ). According to Aylmore (2005) , the complex AuCl/C0
2is
formed initially and is rapidly oxidized to AuCl/C0
4. The general reac-
tion is described in Eq. (35). It is worth mentioning Baghalha (2012)
who observed that the gold-chloride complex was unstable and
could re-precipitated upon contact with a reducing mineral, such
as chalcopyrite. Typical chloride gold leaching conditions are 5–
10 g/L Cl 2, 5–10 g/L NaCl, solution pH of <2 and standard redox
potential of about 752 mV (vs. SCE) (Sparrow and Woodcock, 1995 ).

However, the most stable platinum and palladium chloro com-
plexes are PtCl2/C0
6and PdCl2/C0
4;respectively ( Mahmoud, 2003 ). In the
Eh–pH diagrams (not shown), PtCl2/C0
6predominates over a wide
acidic area and high potential regions; PdCl2/C0
4predominates inacidic and lower potential regions ( Harjanto et al., 2006;
Mahmoud, 2003 ). The standard electrode potentials for platinum
and palladium metal solubilization in aqueous chloride media are
expressed by the half reactions in Eqs. (36) and (37) . A standard
potential higher than 740 mV is therefore required to oxidize aPt
(s)and Pd (s)mixture.

In general, PGM dissolution is based on providing high oxida-
tion potential and effective complexing ions in solution(Mahmoud, 2003 ). Chlorination rates are favored by low pH, high
chloride and chlorine levels, increased temperature and a largeore surface area ( La Brooy et al., 1994 ). PGM chlorocomplex stabil-
ity increases at higher chloride-ion concentrations in solution, andthis increases their dissolution efﬁciency (Mahmoud, 2003 ).
Chlorine/chloride technology has been applied industrially on a
signiﬁcan t
scale ( Zhang et al., 2012 ). The addition of a chloride salt
to a moderate H 2SO4concentration stabilizes PGM ions in the
solution by forming corresponding chloro complexes and hence
improves their dissolution e.g. in the Platsol/C210process. However,
chloride leaching requires special reactors such as glass-lined ves-sels to resist its highly corrosive conditions (Zhang et al., 2012;
Lundström, 2009; Winand, 1991 ).
4.2.3. Bromide leach processes of precious metals
Bromine/bromide gold leaching from ores was reported as early
as1846
(Aylmore, 2005; Kuzugüdenli and Kantar, 1999 ). The nat-
ural advantages claimed for bromine are rapid extraction, non-tox-
icity and adaptability to a wide range of solution pH values (Prasad
et al., 1991 ). Leaching in bromine solution shows much faster gold
extraction kinetics with no worse copper dissolution compared tothe alkali systems ( Vukcevic, 1996; La Brooy et al., 1994 ).
Meersbergen et al. (1993) recorded similar gold extraction levels
for both cyanide and bromine/bromide solutions, while the leach-
ing kinetics for the bromide system were about four times faster
than those obtained with cyanide. Typical bromide gold leaching
conditions are 2–5 g/L Br
2, 0–10 g/L NaBr, solution pH of 5–6 and
standard redox potential of about 612 mV (vs. SCE) (Sparrow andWoodcock, 1995 ).
As noted earlier, Dawson and
 Kelsall (2007) have discussed the
use of Eh–pH diagrams to interpret platinum and palladium disso-
lution behavior in halide solutions including bromide. The pre-
dicted Pd and Pt behaviors in bromide media are similar to those
in chloride media, although with slightly larger stability regions
for the aqueous bromo complex species which extend to some
extent to more alkaline pH’s than in chloride media. So it may be
possible to leach PGMs selectively in bromide, but the solution
pH would need to be more acidic. Dadgar et al. (1997) have sug-
gested that gold, platinum and palladium dissolution in brominesolutions proceeds according to Eqs. (38)–(40) .

For platinum dissolution from Pt compounds such as platinum
oxide, a redox potential of about 850–1250 mV is required. The
redox potential required to dissolve Pd is about 500–750 mV
(Dadgar et al., 1997 ). Due to the high potential required to produce
precious metal-bromide complexes from the metal, the addition ofa strong oxidant such as bromine is needed. Bromide can also be
added to the leaching solution along with chlorine (e.g. in theC.N. Mpinga et al. / Minerals Engineering 78 (2015) 93–113 107Intec process) or hypochlorite (as oxidant), to generate bromine
in situ as shown in Eqs. (41) and (42) (Kuzugüdenli and Kantar,
1999 ).

Zhang et al. (2012) stated that special equipment is required for
managing the safety and health risks in bromide leaching processes,
due to the volatility of bromine which has a vapor pressure of 10
and 28 kPa at 0 and 35 /C176C, respectively. This restricts it from indus-
trial applications. However, according to Aylmore (2005) , the use of
commercially available organic bromides (e.g., N-halo hydantoins
such as Geobrome 3400) reduces problems with vapor losses.
Another disadvantage of bromine use is likely to be high reagent
consumption in the presence of reactive ore components such as
sulﬁdes ( Prasad et al., 1991 ). Finally Wan et al. (1993) found that
neutral poly-acrylic ester adsorbents such as XRD-7 and XRD-8(which are resistant to hypochlorite oxidation) can be used for pre-
cious metals recovery from halide solutions. It is believed that there
are no commercial scale operations using this technology for PGM
leaching.
4.3. Thiosystem (thiosulfate, thiocyanate and thiourea) leach processes
The thiosystem leaching includes thiourea, thiosulfate and thio-
cyanate. The
lack of information in literature on the ability to
regenerate and recycle leaching solutions (minimizing lixiviantconsumption) increases the importance of research in this ﬁeld.
However, the thiosystem forms stable complexes with precious
metals ( Table 3 ), intermediate to the chloride and cyanide com-
plexes both of which have been shown sufﬁciently stable for indus-trial use.
4.3.1. Thiourea leach processes of precious metals
Gold dissolves in acidic thiourea solutions forming cationic
complexes (anodic
half reaction in Eq. (43)). One of the important
features of thiourea [SC(NH 2)2, or Tu] gold dissolution is that the
leaching can be performed in acidic media, enabling the use of sol-
uble oxidizing agents such as ferric salts (Eq. (44))( Li and Miller,
2006; Munoz and Miller, 1999 ). The leach reaction is rapid and
according to Prasad et al. (1991) , gold extractions of up to 99%
can be achieved in acidic conditions (solution pH of about 1.4)within 10–15 min. Typical thiourea gold leaching conditions are
0.1–1% Tu, 0.2% Fe
3+and solution pH of 1–2 ( Sparrow and
Woodcock, 1995 ).

2þFe2þð44Þ
It is pertinent to note that the standard redox potential for the
reaction in Eq. (44) equals 420 mV and that of Fe3+/Fe2+is 770 mV.
Hence ferric ion may oxidize thiourea during gold leaching if it is
used as oxidant (Li and Miller, 2006 ).La Brooy et al. (1994) have
argued that Eh values of 400–600 mV are required for signiﬁcantgold dissolution rates with ferric ion in the leach system. Wan
et al. (1993) have concluded that it was necessary to maintain
the leaching potential between 420 to 450 mV (vs. SHE) in order
to limit thiourea decomposition and to optimize gold extraction.
Thiourea has long been known to form extractable complexes
(its involvem
ent in elution/stripping processes) with both
platinum and palladium (Schoeman et al., 2012; Dunne et al.,2009; Tatarnikov et al., 2004; Green et al., 2004 ). However, it
would seem that no work has been conducted on leaching PGMores/concentrates using thiourea as no literature could be found.Finally despite its low acute toxicity, thiourea is not a safe reagentat all. It is a potent thyroid poison for humans, and recognized as
potential ly
carcinogenic where chronic exposure is possible
(Rosia, 2007; Kuzugüdenli and Kantar, 1999 ). Nonetheless, Li and
Miller (2006) have an opposed view in this matter, they have
argued that thiourea has been shown to be a carcinogen for ratsand possibly for trout. They also pointed out that thiourea has been
used for years in thyroid disease treatment for humans and
thereby considered to be non-carcinogenic to humans.
4.3.2. Thiosulfate leach processes of precious metals
The use of thiosulfate (S
2O2/C0
3) for gold extraction has been
reported as early as 1880 ( Prasad et al., 1991 ). Sodium thiosulfate
and ammonium thiosulfate are the two salts commonly used ingold leaching ( Zhang et al., 2012 ). Thiosulfate is stable in alkaline
medium. Hence alkaline solutions are used to prevent its decom-position by acid although gold thiosulfate complex is quite stable
once it has formed ( La Brooy et al., 1994 ). Two patents were
assigned to Kerley (1983) for sulﬁte ions addition in order to stabi-
lize thiosulfate solutions during gold leaching reactions. Sulﬁte
ions react with any sulﬁde ions in solution, thereby preventing
metal sulﬁdes precipitation. The overall stoichiometry for gold dis-
solution in alkaline aqueous thiosulfate solutions, and in the pres-
ence of oxygen is expressed in Eq. (45) (La Brooy et al., 1994 ).
4AuþO2þ8S2O2/C0

Ammoniacal thiosulfate solution is suitable for leaching gold
ores/concentrates containing alkaline components in the presence
of copper, manganese and/or arsenic which are sensitive to cyanide
leaching ( Zhang et al., 2012 ). In contrast to thiourea and thio-
cyanate, gold dissolves slowly in alkaline thiosulfate, but the disso-lution rate is markedly enhanced by the presence of ammonia and
copper ions.
Grosse et al. (2003) observed that the activation energy
required to dissolve metallic gold in the presence of ammonia at
solution pH of 10, with excess thiosulfate and Cu(II), was
15.54 kJ/mol while in the absence of ammonia and Cu(II); the acti-
vation energy rises to 27.99 kJ/mol demonstrating the catalytic
effects of ammonia and Cu(II). La Brooy et al. (1994) found that
copper ions (catalytic oxidant) accelerated the gold dissolution ratetwenty-fold. Typical thiosulfate gold leaching conditions are 0.2 M
Na
2S2O3,2MN H 4OH, 3 g/L Cu, solution pH of P7, temperature of
50/C176C and standard redox potential of about /C089 mV (vs. SCE)
(Sparrow and Woodcock, 1995 ).
Experimental investigations by Anthony and Williams quoted
byAzaroual et
al. (2001) showed that dissolved Pt concentrations
rise sharply with S 2O2/C0
3concentration. These researchers have indi-
cated Pt ðS2O3Þ6/C0

high to guarantee platinum mobility. Pd ðS2O3Þ6/C0

complexes have aqueous solubilities above 10 ppb at solution pH
of 7 and temperature of 25 /C176C. However, observations by Grosse
et al. (2003) that the formed complexes are not thermodynamically
stable, and slowly decompose into insoluble S-bridged oligomers,
conﬂicts with conclusions reached by Mountain and Wood
(1988) and Hancock et al. (1977) who have indicated stable Pt
and Pd thiosulfate complexes do exist (see Table 3 and Fig. 20 ).
Nevertheless, no single industrial operation using thiosulfate forPGM leaching has been reported.
4.3.3. Thiocyanate leach processes of precious metals4.3.3.1. Gold thiocyanate acid leaching. Thiocyanate has been known
fora
long time to act as gold lixiviant (Adams, 2005; Broadhurst
and du Preez, 1993 ). One of the thiocyanate system’s important
features is to leach precious metals in acidic solutions, thus avoid-ing problems related to neutralisation and material handling,108 C.N. Mpinga et al. / Minerals Engineering 78 (2015) 93–113especially for slurries after sulﬁde minerals pre-oxidation (Wan
and LeVier, 2011; Li et al., 2008 ). Gold can be leached by 0.01–
0.05 M SCN/C0at potentials of around 400–450 mV and solution
pH of 1–3 in the presence of either ferric ions 2–5 g/L or peroxide
as oxidant ( Aylmore, 2005 ). Generally, ferric available from sulﬁde
mineral oxidation can be employed as oxidant for precious metalsleaching. The standard oxidation potential for ferric to ferrous cou-
ple is 770 mV (vs. SHE).
However, the published lower and upper potential ranges for
the formatio
n of tetrathiocyano-auric [or aurithiocyanate:
AuðSCNÞ/C0
4] and di-thiocyano-aurous [or aurothiocyanate:
AuðSCNÞ/C02] show considerable discrepancy in the literature. For
some authors, Au ðSCNÞ/C02forms at the upper potential range limit
of about 691 mV ( Li et al., 2012a,b,c; Senanayake, 2004b;
Kuzugüdenli and Kantar, 1999; Broadhurst and du Preez, 1993 ),
while for others it forms at the lower potential limit of around
659 mV probably as a result of thiocyanate oxidation by ferric ions
(Li et al., 2008; Adams, 2005; Sparrow and Woodcock, 1995 ). The
commonly reported and simpliﬁed reactions are written as inEqs. (46) and (47).

known to form complexes with thiocyanate ion in solution (Kriek,
2008; Oleschuk
and Chow, 1998; Al-bazi and Chow, 1984 ).
Hamacek and Havel (1999) have found that Pt and Pd thiocyanate
complexes present higher stability as compared with chloro
complexes. Table 3 shows the stability constants of selected
precious metal complex species that have been reported inliterature. As can be seen, thiocyanate forms stable complexes with
precious metals, intermediate to the chloride and cyanide
complexes both of which have been shown sufﬁciently stable for
industrial use.
Furthermore, plots of log{[Pt(II)] or [Pt(IV)]} against log[Pd(II)]
and log[Pd(II)]
against log[Ag(I)] shown in Fig. 20 A and B, sug-
gested by Hancock et al. (1977) , may be used to predict Pt and
Pd values for which no experimental data are currently available
in thiocyanate lixiviant systems. Fig. 20 shows a good linear corre-
lation of the published values for all the ligands, displaying thevalidity of these constants. It is pertinent mentioning that the lin-
ear correlation of stability constants of complex species proposed
by these authors paves the way to establish reliable thermody-
namic data for Pt(II, IV) and Pd(II) complexes in thiocyanate
solutions.
Elding (1978) hascarried
 out extensive studies on Pt and Pd
aqua complexes anation by Cl/C0;Br/C0;I/C0and SCN/C0. He observed
Fig. 20. (A) Linear free-energy relation for log ðb4;b6Þof Pt(II, IV) complexes plotted against log b4for Pd complexes, (B) log b4for Pd(II) complexes formation plotted against
logb4for Ag(I) complexes formation with the same ligand ( Hancock et al., 1977 ).C.N. Mpinga et al. / Minerals Engineering 78 (2015) 93–113 109the following kinetic trans-effect order: H 2O<Cl/C0<Br/C0<I/C0<SCN/C0.
Hence taking into account the differences in trans-effect between
palladium and platinum, the former complexes react 5 /C2105times
faster for all anation reactions and about 2 /C2106for all acid
hydrolyses than the corresponding platinum complexes.
Platinum and palladium form a number of chloro complexes
that have
labile character towards several hydrophobic ligands
such as SCN/C0. This leads to the formation of several highly extrac-
table complexes at room temperature (Fontas et al., 2009;
Oleschuk and Chow, 1998 ). The SCN/C0ligand can coordinate with
either its ‘hard’ nitrogen atom, or ‘softer’ sulfur atom. Both plat-
inum (IV) and palladium (II) form complexes coordinating with
the sulfur atom, leading to Pt ðSCNÞ2/C0
6] and Pd ðSCNÞ2/C0
4complexes
formation according to reaction mechanisms in Eqs. (48) and
(49), respectively ( Oleschuk and Chow, 1998 ).

It is worth mentioning that palladium (II) in the presence of
SCN/C0undergoes a substitution reaction almost instantaneously
in the form of Pd ðSCNÞ2/C0
4;while platinum (IV) thiocyanate complex
formation is highly dependent on SCN/C0; although its formation
can be accelerated photochemically or with heating. The rate is
also inversely proportional to pH and the reaction is completely
inhibited at solution pH of 7 ( Al-bazi and Chow, 1984 ). It would
appear that in the absence of light and heat that palladium com-plex should still be formed. This observation has shed light on
the expected differential PGM leaching rates.
4.3.3.3. Stability of SCN
/C0towards oxidation – PGM leaching
kinetics. In gold leaching processes, the stability of thiocyanate
species is
strongly dependent on oxidation potential and leaching
conditions ( Li et al., 2012c ). However, under the oxidation/leaching
potentials required for gold dissolution, thiocyanate is thermody-namically unstable and can be oxidized by ferric ion to sulfate, car-
bonate and ammonium according to the reaction in Eq. (50) (Li
et al., 2012a,c ).

It is important to note that SCN/C0oxidation occurs at a potential
(141 mV) below that of the corresponding reaction for forming the
precious metals complex, e.g. 691 mV for Au(I). Therefore, there is
a competing reaction to gold dissolution which increases reagent
consumption ( Botz et al., 2001 ).Dunne et al. (2009) have indicated
that thiocyanate is much more stable in the leaching of oxide oresthan in the leaching of sulﬁde ores. Furthermore, Li et al. (2012c)
have observed that thiocyanate oxidation by ferric ion in acidicsolutions was slow at room temperature (25 /C176C) but signiﬁcant at
50/C176C. Conversely according to Barbosa and Monhemius quoted
byKuzugüdenli and Kantar (1999) , for effective gold leaching,conditions less desirable for safety and reagent stability (HSCN,pK
aat 25 /C176C equals 0.9), like low solution pH and very high temper-
ature (85 /C176C) are required.
Besides being destroyed by oxidation during leaching, thio-
cyanate is
known to form complexes with several metal cations.
For example, a precipitate is formed with copper, probably as
Cu(SCN) 2, and the blood-red ferric-thiocyanate complexes are
formed with iron. It should be noted that the formation of suchstable compounds could reduce ferric ions oxidizing potential
and the free thiocyanate concentration required for precious met-
als dissolution ( Li et al., 2012a,b,c,d,e). While it may be possible to
recirculate SCN
/C0in the iron complexes, the SCN/C0in the precipi-
tated copper complexes would be lost from the circuit. Thus it
can be expected that this leaching system will suffer from signiﬁ-
cant reagent consumption ( Adams, 2005; Aylmore, 2005 ).
Finally SCN/C0gives a slow leaching rate. Li et al. (2012b) found
that gold dissolution rate decreases with an increase in the leach-ing time. According to the authors, the slow gold dissolution rate
which was almost insensitive to thiocyanate concentration and
slightly dependent upon ferric ion concentration could be linked
to the high anodic process overpotential for gold dissolution.
They have suggested the use of catalysts in order to accelerate
the rate and, at the same time, to reduce thiocyanate consumption
(oxidation).
Yang et al. (2011) found that
 the addition of small amounts of
thiourea to thiocyanate-ferric solutions had a synergistic effect
on gold dissolution. The dissolution rate was found to be higher
than that obtained when either ferric-thiocyanate or ferric-
thiourea solutions were used separately at similar concentrations
used in the mixture. In addition, the mixture has the advantage
of being more stable towards oxidation in comparison with thio-
cyanate alone. The optimum concentration for thiourea and thio-
cyanate was about 0.005 M and 0.05 M, respectively.
4.3.3.4. Precious metals recovery from pregnant thiocyanate
solutions. Recent research by Liet al. (2012d,e) considered and
examined the three most common process strategies for gold
recovery from pregnant thiocyanate solutions i.e., solvent extrac-
tion, cementation and activated carbon adsorption. Each method
has its own advantages and disadvantages, and may be effective
in recovering precious metals from the typical concentration of
clear solutions, but may become less efﬁcient or even inadequate
when traces of precious metal ions are to be recovered from thio-
cyanate containing pulp (e.g., solvent extraction). No single indus-
trial operation using PGM acid leaching in thiocyanate solutions
has been reported.
5. Conclusions
During the last two decades, there have been great strides in
new technology
development for PGMs recovery from low-grade
deposits. In attempting to summarize the large body of work, much
detail has been sacriﬁced. It is hoped that the information provided
will be sufﬁcient to highlight some important issues relating to this
matter and to point the reader in the direction of more detailed
information, should this be required. The review has highlighted
several areas worthy of special attention. These include the effects
of salt additives, mechanical activation and redox potential control
upon processes chemistry. Oxygen injection at supersonic velocity
to overcome ferric regeneration inefﬁciency by oxygen/air use in
atmospheric processing was also highlighted.
The apparent advantages and limitations in performance associ-
ated with
each process have been discussed. By far, only four pro-
cesses, namely Albion, Nitrogen Species Catalyzed (NSC),Outokumpu HydroCopper
/C210and Total Pressure Oxidation, have110 C.N. Mpinga et al. / Minerals Engineering 78 (2015) 93–113been commercially implemented on a large scale, basically for cop-
per recovery except for the ﬁrst two technologies which are treat-
ing precious metal containing feedstocks. However, each deposit’s
mineralogy poses its own challenges, particularly linked to mineral
associations and the unique PGM make-up of each deposit. The
complexity of PGM mineralogy (in particular when compared to
gold) and the varied interactions of PGM minerals with lixiviants
make for a complex metallurgical scenario where a-priory
prediction of feasible processes is difﬁcult.
In the Australian context, the Panton Sill deposit contains PGM
invarious
minerals including palladium antimonide (PdSb) and
platinum arsenide (PtAs 2). The presence of base metal sulﬁdes such
as pentlandite (Ni,Fe) 9S8, chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) and pyrite (FeS 2)
have to be dealt with. Methods such as roasting and pressureleaching are capital intensive and, in the case of roasting, produceenvironmentally damaging emissions requiring management. The
kinetics and acid leaching mechanisms of the above PGM-
containing minerals vary and can be enhanced by modifying the
leach conditions or by pre-treatment of the ores/concentrates
(e.g., mechanical activation).

ChromititeABSTRACT
Selective sulfation-roast-water leach process of a complex, chromite-rich Cu-Ni-PGM ore to dissolve water-
soluble base metal sulfates contained therein was investigated as an alternative process to remove base metals
prior to the extraction of precious metals. Ground run-of-mine ore (P 80<7 5 μm) was mixed with concentrated
H2SO4(sulfating agent) and Na 2SO4(dual catalyst and sulfating agent) to intensify atmospheric sulfation roast
reaction in an unvented electric furnace (static roast under reducing conditions). The acquired calcine was waterleached to extract the Ni and Cu sulfates. The roasting conditions were optimized using a Response SurfaceMethodology which included a Desirability Function Approach in order to maximize Cu and Ni extraction whilstlimiting reagent consumption and suppressing Fe and Cr co-dissolution.
It was possible to decompose the chromatic-ferritic structure and produce water-soluble metal species by
roasting the ore containing 12.80 g/t Pt, 15.20 g/t Pd, 0.0646% Cu, 0.31% Ni, 13.60% Fe and 10.40% Cr.Approximately 90% Ni and 77% Cu were recovered after roasting at 550 °C in closed atmosphere for 2 h with
462 kg/t H
2SO4, 76.9 kg/t Na 2SO4and by leaching at 80 °C with 2 wt% solid density for 24 h. The raw ore,
roasted mass and water-leach residue were characterized by ﬁre assay and Tescan Integrated Mineral Analysis
(TIMA GM Model). Pt + Pd grade has been upgraded from 28 (raw ore) to 32.38 g/t (water-leach residue).
1. Introduction
The Panton Sill is a chromite  rich ore body bearing economic grades 
of Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) and high nuisance levels of Ni and 
Cu. It is a remote deposit situated in the Kimberley region of 
Western Australia. A process was developed that used roasting and 
hydrome-tallurgical techniques to extract the metal values (Bax et al., 
2009). For the purposes of further reference this process will be 
referred to as the “Panton process” which has been described at high 
level by Lewins and Greenaway (2004). The Panton Process proposes 
a complex recovery route using a combination of Calcination 
Cyanidation — Low pH precipitation and Acid pressure oxidative 
leach.
However, the overall process suﬀers from some shortcomings such as 
long leaching time (slow leaching rate), unexplained precipitation and 
redissolution steps, large reagent consumption (due to reacting base 
metal sulﬁdes), loss of platinum to tailings, and an inherently complex 
ﬂowsheet. As a result, alternative hydrometallurgical and/or hybrid 
pyro-hydrometallurgical routes are considered. Mpinga et al. have  
reviewed various non-smelting process options and have  shown the 
potential of various hydrometallurgical option, which may or maynot include a roasting step ( Mpinga et al., 2015, 2014a,b ).
Leaching tests were performed to determine feasible means of
extracting copper and nickel values (the latter being the most valuable
base metal) and simultaneously concentrating platinum metals in a
solid residue. As these metals are also signi ﬁcant reagent consumers
during the precious metal leach stages, it is worthwhile to remove themas completely as economically possible prior to precious metals
extraction. Note that previous studies have shown the refractoriness
of the ore to direct cyanide leaching even after ﬁne grinding ( Lewins
and Greenaway, 2004). Accordingly, it is essential to pretreat the ore byroasting, pressure oxidation, bio- or chemical oxidation, or mechanical
activation to oxidize/disintegrate the sul ﬁde matrix and further remove
these reagent consuming species prior to PGM extraction ( Ellis, 2003;
Senanayake, 2004; Prasad et al., 1991).
The selection of the optimal method is based on economic evalua-
tion and depends greatly on location and legislative controls. By way of
example, within Australia, the National Health and Medical Research
Council (NHMRC) has developed a set of limits for some of the major air
pollutants based on their e ﬀect on human health, including a 10 min
sulfur dioxide goal of 0.25 ppm ( NEPC, 2004 ). The roasting pretreat-

MARKment technique was chosen as it has been proposed for the Panton
process. La Brooy et al. (1994) pointed out that roasting without sulfur
dioxide recovery (emission) is one of the most cost-e ﬀective processing
options for low sulfur orebodies in remote locations. Current environ-
mental legislation would normally require an alkaline scrubbing
system. It should be apparent that the material under investigation is
an ideal candidate for a roasting process, owing to its low total sulfur
content of 0.78%.
The objective of the present work was to determine whether the
introduction of a sulfation roast pretreatment step (instead of conven-
tional oxidation roasting) to break down the crystal lattices, thereby
rendering copper and nickel containing phases amenable to water
leaching, would result in their recoveries and simultaneously concen-
trating platinum metals in a solid residue. The e ﬀects of H 2SO4
(sulfating agent), Na 2SO4(catalyst), roasting temperature, roasting
time, leaching temperature, oxygen addition at the leaching stage and
leaching duration on the dissolution e ﬃciency of various metals
including iron, chromium and PGMs were explored with the aim ofminimizing them; keeping in mind that the ore under examination
contains a large amount (78.12%) of chromite gangue, FeCr
2O4.
2. Theoretical background
2.1. Current practice —Pyrometallurgical approaches
The ore that is best known and similar to the Panton ore in terms of
chromite content is the Upper Group 2 (UG-2) ore as found in the
Bushveld Igneous Complex in South Africa. The processing of high
chromite content ores UG-2 was pioneered by Lonmin Plc. in the 1980s
(Jones, 2005 ). Lonmin Plc. is the world ’s third largest primary platinum
producer after Anglo Platinum and Impala Platinum ( Wilburn, 2012 ).
The predominant portion of Lonmin ’s current annual PGM production is
sourced from the UG-2 ( Jones, 2005 ). As a consequence, Lonmin Plc. has
developed and patented an integrated hydrometallurgical method,suitable for economically treating low-grade PGM sul ﬁde concentrates
with large amounts of chromite gangue ( Bax et al., 2009 ). However, the
process still involves the controversial cyanide leaching technique with
its inherent health hazards, which causes a high environmental liability,
as well as additional expenses related to legal and safe disposal.
Various attempts at treating these PGM-bearing chromite ores have
also been described by other workers. These include work by Liddell and
Adams (2012) and Liddell et al. (2011) that involves the roasting of a
residue from sul ﬁdic pressure oxidation at 900 °C, and subsequent
atmospheric leaching of the precious metals in chloride media, astypically used in PGM re ﬁneries. Green et al. (2004) have proposed a
hydrometallurgical process that comprises a reductive roast at ≥800 °C,
followed by the leaching of the products in HCl/chlorine solutions.
Another alternative approach has been jointly developed between
Mintek and Falconbridge: the ConRoast process ( Jones, 2005 ). The
technology is based on a complete sulfur removal by dead-roasting ataround 950 °C, followed by the smelting of the dead-roasted concentrate
in a DC arc furnace at about 1585 °C. The ConRoast process uses an iron-
based alloy as a collector for nickel, copper, cobalt and PGMs ( Jones,
2002 ). The energy intensive nature of these processes generally limits
their application to higher grade concentrates rather than whole ores.
2.2. Potential approaches —Hybrid pyro-hydrometallurgical options
2.2.1. Panton process
The hybrid pyro-hydrometallurgical work ( Fig. 1) by Platinum
Australia Limited (PLA) on Panton concentrates (P
80of 38 μm) showed
that atmospheric cyanide leaching —following a low-temperature calci-
nation step— could only recover up to 86% Pd, 99% Au, but less than
10% Pt. Fine grinding to P 80of 14 μm provided merely small improve-
ment ( Lewins and Greenaway, 2004 ).
The retention time of a leaching circuit is important for theperformance of any plant, because longer extraction time means lower
eﬃciency of equipment utilization. The long cyanidation retention time
of 100 h ( Fig. 1 ) is uncommon in practice, especially after calcination
pretreatment stage of the concentrates. This requires much larger tanks
(capital cost). For instance in the cyanidation process of gold, the solid
matter is often treated with a diluted solution of NaCN for typical
residence times ranging from 20 to 40 h depending on the head grade
and nature of the ore ( Stange, 1999).
Even though the Panton process suggested a low temperature
cyanidation, Sibrell et al. (1994) have shown that the kinetics of PGM
leaching is signi ﬁcantly accelerated using elevated temperatures and
pressures. Furthermore, copper and nickel are strong cyanicides, as they
consume cyanide reagent potentially to the point of rendering a process
uneconomical ( Mpinga et al., 2014a; Brierley and Brierley, 2001 ).Muir
(2011) stated that copper minerals consume approximately 30 kg NaCN
per ton of ore for every 1% of reactive Cu present or about 2.3 kg of
NaCN for every kilogram of Cu leached. Sceresini (2005) stated that the
cyanidation of Cu(II) minerals with the consequent formation ofcyanogen, (CN)
2, can result in the loss of cyanide in the proportion of
0.39 kg NaCN/kg Cu(II) leached.
The presence of cupric copper in an ore results in the irreversible
loss of cyanide as cyanate according to the reaction in Eq. (1)(Breuer
et al., 2009; Sceresini, 2005 ). The calcination carried out according to
the process shown in Fig. 1 promotes the oxidation of all copper
minerals present in the feed material. This renders them more amenable
to cyanide leaching, and increases the lixiviant and oxygen consump-
tions. In addition, the generation of Cu(CN)32−is also a signi ﬁcant
problem, because its presence in tailings supernatant tends to stabilize
weak-acid dissociable cyanide in a form toxic to wildlife yet less
amenable to natural degradation processes ( Lawrence and López,
2011 ). The Panton process su ﬀers also from the discharge of slow-
dissolving platinum minerals, such as sperrylite, to tailings storage
facilities.

2.2.2. Selective sulfation roast processes
Owing to the more stringent environmental regulations, as well as
the need to reduce energy consumption, metals production by sulfation
roasting is gaining more attention as an alternative process to smelting
(Yu et al., 2012; Prasad and Pandey, 1998; Norrgran, 1985 ). The
method is advantageous as it decomposes the components of a materialat moderate temperatures, with their conversion to water-soluble
sulfates and thereby simultaneous concentrate platinum metals in a
solid residue ( Dimitrijevic et al., 2016; Kshumaneva et al., 2014).
The sulfation roast process can be carried out by a number of sulfate
promoters, such as H
2S, H 2SO4, (NH 4)2SO4,F e 2(SO 4)3·H2O, FeS 2,KOH,
NaOH, K 2SO4,N a 2SO4,N a 2CO3, etc. ( Parirenyatwa et al., 2016; Yu
et al., 2014a,b; Hunt and Kraus, 2013; Guo et al., 2012, 2009;
Frankiewicz, 1978). Frankiewicz (1978) found that the salt to concen-
trate ratio a ﬀected the conversion of both copper and nickel with the
larger e ﬀect being on nickel conversion. Generally, the mass ratio
should lie within the 0.05 –0.50 range, and the higher the ratio, the
higher the degree of conversion. The preferred reactor for sulfation
roast processes is the ﬂuidized bed roaster ( Hanf and Schmidt, 1979).
2.2.2.1. Predicting prevailing phase equilibria at the roasting
stage. Graphically, roasting thermodynamics can be expressed by
predominance area diagrams, or Kellogg diagrams. RepresentativeKellogg diagrams drawn at 550 °C using the HSC Chemistry ®7.1
software package are shown in Fig. 2. In general, the increase of both
sulfur dioxide and oxygen partial pressures enhances the formation ofsulfates at a given temperature ( Safarzadeh et al., 2014 ).
The formation of CuSO
4and NiSO 4are thermodynamically feasible
at 550 °C. The optimal conditions (partial pressures) can be estimated
by superimposing —at same scale —the above stability diagrams asC.N. Mpinga et al. Minerals Engineering 110 (2017) 153–165
154shown in Fig. 3. It is essential to be aware that the complex systems
encountered in practice involve numerous interactions (e.g., presence
of catalysts and/or sulfating agents) which may greatly alter the simple
sulfation equilibria ( Kellogg, 1964). In addition, the software package
uses pure substances to calculate thermodynamic properties.The roasting process can dramatically improve base metals leaching
rate. However, it may also form secondary wrapping (e.g. metal ferrites,
FeAsO 4, etc.) that can reduce the leaching rate of forthcoming PGMs.
Although the mechanisms that retain arsenic in calcines are compli-cated and still poorly understood ( Walker et al., 2015 ), several studies

155have revealed its tendency to be retained in calcines during the roasting
of arsenic-bearing sul ﬁdes. This may be elucidated by the two-stage
roast of arsenopyrite bearing materials ( Rumiantsev et al., 2016; Grund
et al., 2005 ). In their ﬁrst non-oxidizing stage i.e. mildly reducing
conditions, they are roasted at lower temperatures of 400 –450 °C in an
oxygen de ﬁcient environment. This produces the volatile trivalent
arsenic oxide (As 2O3) and/or arsenic sul ﬁde (As 2S3) and avoids the
formation of the harmful ferric arsenate FeAsO 4, which inhibits
precious metal solubilisation by blocking the pores of the calcine(Valenzuela, 2000; Prasad et al., 1991 ). Hence, the roasting pretreat-
ment should not only provide maximum base metals recovery, but alsoproduce a calcine with porous structure which facilitates reagent
diﬀusion through the reacting product layer improving the leaching
kinetics of PGMs.
On referring to Fig. 3,i fO
2and SO 2partial pressures are maintained
at the values corresponding to the shaded region (right upper corner),the roasting process will yield NiSO
4and CuSO 4. However, a limited
portion of Cr and Fe conversion is unavoidable. It should be observedthat the shaded region has a low oxygen partial pressure of around
10
−13to 10−12bars, as compared to the oxygen partial pressure in air
which is 0.213 bar ( Rhoades and Bell, 2012 ). This is corroborated by
the good leaching recoveries of copper and nickel from static air
roasting systems (e.g. unvented electric mu ﬄe furnace) as reported in
open literature ( Zhao et al., 2015; Ferron et al., 2006; Baglin et al.,
1985; Fursman, 1962 ).
2.2.2.2. Sulfation roast processes using sulfate compounds —Sulfation
mechanisms . The typical temperature range of conventional sulfation
roast is between 650 and 700 °C ( Güntner and Hammerschmidt, 2012 ).
The average retention time of solids in the roaster is highly dependent
upon the feed materials ’mineralogy. Generally longer roasting times
convert more sul ﬁde mineral to sulfate, but long roasting times may
also decrease the economy of the process.
According to Norrgran (1985) the preferred time is from two to six
hours. The sulfation process has also been referred to as acid baking, inparticular when applied at temperatures up to 400 °C ( Dimitrijevic
et al., 2016 ). It must be emphasized that acid baking su ﬀers from large
amounts of iron that enter the solution as indicated by Eq. (2), requiring
additional operation before copper recovery ( Prasad and Pandey, 1998;
Norrgran, 1985 ). Iron elimination remains a major operational problem
in hydrometallurgy. Furthermore, chromium (III) is generated from thedigestion of chromite ores with concentrated sulfuric acid as described
in Eq. (3)(Ustao ğlu and Geveci, 2007; Stauter and Um, 1977 ).CuFeS + 2H SO → CuSO + FeSO + 2H S 22 4 4 42 (2)

Harris et al. (2007) stated that the presence of even relatively small
concentration of ferric iron causes problems to all conventionalreagents used in solvent extraction of copper. On the other hand,
Chou (1986) has investigated the production of nickel powder using
hydrogen reduction, he suggested that iron, copper and cobalt con-centrations in the nickel sulfate solution should not exceed 100 ppm
each. Contaminants such as cadmium, boron, lead, chromium and
calcium should not exceed a total of about 400 ppm. Therefore, the
solubilisation of such impurities must be limited.
In general, the oxygen partial pressure and the temperature in the
roaster are the two important parameters controlling the ﬁnal products
(La Brooy et al., 1994 ). High SO
2contents are also favourable for the
reaction. However, its level depends on the sulfur content of the feed
material ( Güntner and Hammerschmidt, 2012). According to
Rambiyana et al. (2014) the pSO 2should be kept high at more than
1%v/v to favour the formation of sulfates during the roasting of base
metal sul ﬁdes. On the other hand, the roasting temperature is generally
dictated by the decomposition temperatures of metal sulfates to beextracted ( Hanf and Schmidt, 1979).
When a number of metals are to be extracted, as is usually the case,
Norrgran (1985) stated that the temperature will approach the lowest
decomposition temperature of the metal sulfates in question. AccordingtoHabashi (1969) , sulfation roast of chalcopyrite at about 650 °C
converts copper in water-soluble form and iron to Fe
2O3.Yu et al.
(2014a) found that nickel ferrite (NiFe 2O4), which is resistant to
sulfation, forms at temperatures of more than 700 °C.
Norrgran (1985) suggested that the energetic decomposition tem-
peratures of FeSO 4, ZnSO 4, CuSO 4, CoSO 4and NiSO 4are 480, 600, 670,
735 and 764 °C, respectively. Chromium is in its Cr(III) oxidation state
in the chromite FeCr 2O4(Hawley et al., 2004 ).Udupa (1982) found
that chromium (III) sulfate hexahydrate, Cr 2(SO 4)3·6H 2O, decomposes
in two stages: The ﬁrst begins at 100 °C and is complete at 400 °C;
whereas the anhydrous Cr 2(SO 4)3decomposes in a single step in the
550–750 °C temperature range by forming Cr 2O3in the ﬁnal residue.
Hence temperatures greater than the decomposition temperatures of
iron and chromium sulfates, approximately 500 and 550 °C respec-tively, are required to promote the conversion of signi ﬁcant proportions
of iron and chromium sulfates into their respective insoluble oxides.Note that sperrylite (PtAs

156possible melting temperature) is 597 °C ( Okamoto, 1990). Conventional
sulfation roast can be schematized by one direct reaction step (Eq. (4))
or by three sequential reaction steps (Eqs. (5)–(12)) as described
byGüntner and Hammerschmidt (2012) .
Me S +7 / 2 O →M e S O +S O +1 / 2 O22 4 2 2 (4)
MeS + 5/2O → MeO + 2SO22 2 (5)

MeS + 3/2O → MeO + SO 2 2 (7)
MeS +3 O →2 M e O+2 S O22 2 2 (8)
According to the three sequential steps mechanism, metal sul ﬁdes
areﬁrst oxidized to metal oxides (Eqs. (5)–(8)), and then sulfur dioxide
is oxidized to sulfur trioxide (Eq. (9)). The production of sulfur trioxide
(SO 3) gas is critical in the formation of sulfates ( Wilkomirsky, 2014 ). Its
reaction in Eq. (9)is catalysed by metal oxides, such as Fe 2O3(Hanf and
Schmidt, 1979 ).
SO+ 1 / 2 O⎯ → ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ SO 22Fe O
323(9)
Another way to increase SO 3(g)partial pressure in the roaster is
through the introduction of sulfuric acid that decomposes at high
temperatures to generate SO 3(g)according to the reaction in Eq. (10)
(Safarzadeh et al., 2014 ). These authors found that the maximum
amount of SO 3(g)was in the 450– 500 °C temperature range, after which
SO3(g)started to decompose into SO 2(g)and O 2(g). The temperature
dependence of the equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction is
described in Eq. (11), where K cis the equilibrium constant and T (K) the
temperature inside the reactor ( Shin et al., 2009).

Finally, metal oxides react with sulfur trioxide to form sulfates and/
or basic sulfates (Eqs. (12) and (13) ), wherein Me denotes mainly Cu,
Ni, Co, Cr and Fe but also Ca and Mg. Güntner and Hammerschmidt
(2012) stated that high water content at slurry feeding is supposed to
promote the formation of copper sulfates. Although the precise
mechanism is not yet understood, similar conclusions were reached
byGuo et al. (2009) who indicated that the addition of water was
necessary for good mixing and helped sulfation reactions.
MeO + SO → MeSO 3 4 (12)
2MeO + SO → MeO·MeSO 3 4 (13)
Prasad and Pandey (1999) have carried out studies on chalcopyrite
oxidation in static air bed conditions, they observed that its sulfationroast route with ferric oxide proceed through the formation of copper
sulfate from copper sul ﬁde (Cu
2S/CuS) generated from chalcopyrite
(Eq. (14)), rather than direct conversion of chalcopyrite to copper
sulfate. As such, the current authors believe that the sulfation roast
under investigation may proceed within the 400 –550 °C temperature
range without oxygen overpressure (see Fig. 3).

The main minerals in the ore under investigation are pentlandite
(Ni,Fe) 9S8, chalcopyrite CuFeS 2, chromite FeCr 2O4and siliceous gangue
materials. Thereby prominent species that the roasted calcine maycontain at conventional temperatures are nickel oxide (NiO), nickel
ferrite (NiFe
2O4), heazlewoodite (Ni 3S2), iron nickel monosulﬁ de solid
solutions ((Fe,Ni) 1−xS), nickel sul ﬁde (NiS), cupric oxide (CuO),
bornite (Cu 5FeS 4), chalcocite (Cu 2−xS), copper ferrite (CuFe 2O4),
copper chromite (CuCr 2O4), chromium oxide (Cr 2O3), chromium (III)
sulﬁde (Cr 2S3), hematite (Fe 2O3), magnetite (Fe 3O4), as well as the
water-soluble sulfates ( Yu et al., 2012; Geng et al., 2012; Qi et al., 2011;Hargreaves et al., 2006; Dumeignil et al., 2003; Prasad and Pandey,1998; Jacob et al., 1992 ). The simpli ﬁed decomposition reactions of
chalcopyrite and chromite can be described as in Eqs. (15) and (16) ,
respectively.
2CuFeS + 15/2O → 2CuSO + Fe O + 2SO 22 4 2 3 2 (15)
FeCr O + 1/4O → 1/2Fe O + Cr O 24 2 23 23 (16)
Yu et al. (2014b) observed that the sulfation of nickel sul ﬁde was an
extremely slow process, due to a dense nickel sulfate layer that inhibits
further sulfation. According to Sohn and Wadsworth (2013) the
sulfation of nickel in pentlandite proceeds through an oxidationroasting step to form NiO and SO
2. In the second step, NiO reacts with
SO2from the ﬁrst step and O 2to form NiSO 4. These authors emphasized
that the sulfation of pure NiO is very slow, because NiSO 4is imperme-
able to SO 2, since it forms a protective layer around unreacted NiO. The
simpliﬁed basic reactions are summarised in Eqs. (17) and (18)
(Fursman, 1962). However, NiSO 4can be made permeable to gases
by the addition of Na 2SO4which creates new sites for sulfates formation
(Prasad and Pandey, 1998; Norrgran, 1985 ).

NiO + SO + 1/2O → NiSO(s) 2(g) 2(g) 4(s) (18)
Lastly referring to sulfation roast, a loss in weight generally reveals
the formation of oxides or the decomposition of metal sulfates, whereasa gain suggests the formation of sulfates ( Basturkcu and Acarkan, 2016;
Prasad and Pandey, 1998).
2.2.2.3. Sulfuric acid consumption . Primary nickel is produced from
either nickel-iron-copper sul ﬁde ores or nickeliferous lateritic ores
typically assaying 1– 3% Ni ( Table 1)( Mihaylov, 2003 ). In high
pressure acid leaching technology (HPAL), acid consumption is
generally dictated by the magnesium and aluminium content of the
ore. Mayze (1999) stated that the low magnesium content of Cawse
required only 375 kg of acid per tonne of ore to maximize nickelrecovery. Bulong, with a high magnesium content, is a relatively high
acid consumer requiring 518 kg/t, while Murrin is moderate at 400 kg/
t. This information is useful for safeguarding H
2SO4consumption in this
project and future commercial application, albeit that sulfation roastand HPAL operate di ﬀerently to extract nickel.
2.2.2.4. Selective sulfation roast process using alkali compounds . Alkali
metal sulfates are also reported to promote the sulfation of nickel andcopper concentrates in ﬂuidised bed roasting ( Prasad and Pandey,
1998; Norrgran, 1985 ). The process can be carried out by a number of
sulfate promoters such as KOH, NaOH, K
2SO4,N a 2SO4, and Na 2CO3(Yu
et al., 2014a,b; Guo et al., 2012, 2009; Frankiewicz, 1978). Baimbetov
et al. (2015) stated that technologies of smelting sul ﬁdic materials in
molten alkali are environmentally friendly, due to zero release of sulfurcontaining gases. The reaction chemistry of copper sul ﬁde bearing ores
during alkali roasting using NaOH in the presence of atmosphericoxygen is described in Eq. (19).

It must, however, be borne in mind that the alkali roasting process is
also used worldwide for the extraction of sodium chromate from
chromite ores ( Qi et al., 2011; Tathavakar et al., 2005). Using NaOH
and KOH in the 400 –1000 °C temperature range and in oxidising
atmosphere, Parirenyatwa et al. (2016) have revealed the formation
of water-soluble Na 2CrO 4and K 2CrO 4as end products from chromite
roasting (Equations (20) and (21) ).

(22)
Likewise Antony et al. (2001) roasted FeCr 2O4and Na 2CO3at
temperatures ranging between 900 and 1200 °C in oxidative atmo-sphere to form Na
2CrO 4(Eq. (22)).Nayar et al. (2013) found that
sodium chromate may be heated to 1000 °C without decomposition.This evidences its high thermal stability. Due to environmental
concerns related to the safe disposal of Cr
6+, it is an unlikely scenario
that such a process would ever be utilized for the high chromite-bearingsource under investigation.
3. Materials and methods
3.1. Materials —Run-of-mine ore
Table 2 displays the head grade and mineralogical composition of
the supplied feed material obtained through Tescan Integrated Mineral
Analysis (TIMA GM Model), XRF and ﬁre assay analyses. Its miner-
alogical composition —serving as a guide —is essentially chromite
(78.12%) with a small amount of sperrylite representing 0.02%
(majority of the total platinum present). Although not detected by
Tescan, previous analyses would suggest that palladium antimonide
was the main palladium phase ( Lewins, 2006 ).Copper (0.0646%) was contained in the minerals cuprite (Cu
2O),
lautite (CuAsS) and bornite (Cu 5FeS 4). Pentlandite was detected to be
around 1.51%. Nickel occurs also as arsenide (0.80%) in rammelsber-gite (NiAs
2). The main nickel-bearing silicate minerals are chlorite-
clinochlore (11.16%) and olivine (3.23%). These host minerals maycontain an appreciable amount of nickel trapped inside, that may or
may not be released during the pre-processing stages.
The minerals locking sperrylite in the ore are depicted in Fig. 4.
Around thirty-eight percent occurred with an exposed face of PtAs
2and
the remainder as composite particles of chromite and various silicateminerals. Hence without a pre-processing stage, the accessibility of
lixiviant to non-liberated PGM species would be expected to cause poor
direct leachability.
Jones (2005) andVermaak (1995) noticed that the chromite-rich
UG-2 concentrate, with an average grain size of about 15 μm, required
ﬁne milling to about 80% of less than 75 μm in order to liberate PGM
minerals. On the other hand, the Merensky concentrate which is
amenable to the traditional sul ﬁde matte smelting process was milled
to around 55% of less than 75 μm (average grain size of circa 45 μm).
The average grain size of the PGM minerals in the ore under investiga-
tion was found to be around 9 μm. With regard to the leaching process,
Lottering et al. (2008) have made a distinction between liberation and
surface exposure. They suggested that the measurement of area
exposure is a very good indicator of the leachability, because only
intrinsic inertness to leaching reagents can cause an exposed mineral to
remain unleached. This is crucial as far as leaching is the key step in the
process under investigation.
The feed material for the batch leaching test programme had been
collected in relatively coarse grind size ranging from 710 μm to 2.8 mm.
It was subjected to additional particle size reduction (P
80<7 5 μm)
using a laboratory-size ring mill and afterward was kept in sealed fresh
plastic bag containers —isolated from air e ﬀect—and stored in a freezer
until used. Particle size distribution (PSD) by wet screening ( Fig. 5 )
using Malvern Mastersizer 2000 was carried out at the CSIRO Process
Science and Engineering branch, Waterford in Perth, Western Australia.
The P 80mean size of the particle fed to the sulfation roast process was
around 64 μm.
3.1.1. Analytical instruments
The head grade and mineralogical composition of the supplied feed
material were obtained through ﬁre assay, XRF and Tescan Integrated
Mineral Analysis (TIMA GM Model) operated by the John de Laeter
Centre at Curtin University. Its mineralogical features after sulfation
roast and that of the leach residue (water-insoluble fraction) wereexamined by the same means. The chemical composition of the leachate
was analysed using ICP-MS.
Note that low-grade materials have generally heterogeneous or
“spotty ”distributions of valuable metals. This often presents di ﬃculties
in sampling and assay repeatability. Accordingly, leach residues wereanalysed with TIMA and ﬁre assay to determine their residual metalsTable 2

theseﬁre assay and TIMA results and/or back-calculated from solution
assay results.
3.2. Methods
3.2.1. Methodology —Experimental design
A factorial design was employed to optimize the process. Two sets of
laboratory scale experiments were conducted using ore whose chemical
and mineralogical compositions are displayed in Table 2. The ﬁrst set
consisted of sulfation roast tests designed to generate optimal operatingconditions of the process. The second set of tests consisted of leaching
studies using distilled water as leachant. The statistical approach wasapplied to combine these two experimental designs. The individual
levels for the seven input factors are shown in Table 3. These
independent variables were selected from the literature dedicated tothe sulfation roast-leach processes of copper and/or nickel ores (con-
centrates).
The design of experiments chosen for this study was the
2IV7−3
fractional factorial design for the seven independent variables. Thedesign matrix produced twenty-four treatment combinations including
eight replicates at the centre point, to evaluate the preliminary
signiﬁcance of these variables, the experimental error and the reprodu-
cibility of the data as well as the curvature. The experimental designlayout and results are listed in Table 4. At each combination of the
process settings, the leaching percentages were recorded.
The goal was to maximize copper and nickel leaching rate while
trying to ﬁnd conditions that would minimize both reagent consump-
tion and co-leaching of PGMs and other species. Replicate experiments
were also conducted in order to quantify the reproducibility of the
sulfation roast-leach tests. Experiments were performed in randomized
order to minimize the e ﬀects of extraneous or nuisance variables.
Experimental design and statistical treatment of the results wereperformed using Design-Expert ®version 9.0.6.3.2.2. Sulfation roast procedure
The sulfation roast experiments were carried out at a laboratory
scale by mixing, on weight percent basis, known amount of raw ore (P
80
of < 75 μm, 0.78% sul ﬁde content) with concentrated H 2SO4(98%
purity, ρ= 1.84 g/cm3) and Na 2SO4(99% purity) in a porcelain
crucible. Unless otherwise indicated, the sticky paste-like materialwas relatively evenly distributed through the crucible wall and had
an approximate depth (thickness) of less than 3 mm, eliminating local
overheating (formation of ferrites) and ensuring uniform oxidation
throughout the bed. The charged and covered crucible was placed in an
unvented electric or static air roast mu ﬄe furnace equipped with a
programmable temperature controller, and was gradually heated undernormal atmospheric pressure and oxygen partial pressure conditions at
a linear heating rate ranging from 6 to 10 °C/min.
The roasted sample was allowed to cool to room temperature inside
the furnace. In order to break up formed particle aggregates, the calcine
was reground to 100% passing through a size 75 μm screen, and
weighed before leaching with distilled water. It is of interest to notethe observation made by Tshiongo et al. (2010) that calcine cooling rate
aﬀects the leaching of base metals as it changes the phase distribution
in the calcine and base metals distribution within the phases. A fast
cooling prevented the crystallization that results in the formation of
amorphous and glassy phased calcine, encapsulating metal values and
lowering their solubility.
3.2.3. Leaching procedure
Except where mentioned, leaching experiments were carried out
using 500 mL of distilled water. Once the desired temperature was
reached, the calcine from the previous step (10 g, solid density of 2%
w/v, i.e. at a solid-to-liquid ratio of 1:50) was added into the reactor,
from which point onwards the reaction time was measured. It is
pertinent to mention that the dissolved oxygen content in aqueous
solutions can be increased by the process of aeration.
The eﬃciency of oxygen transfer depends on many factors, includ-
ing bubble size and ﬂow rate ( Navisa et al., 2014; Karimi et al., 2013).
To ascertain its relative importance on the leaching performance ofsulfates (if involved then sulfation roast no successful), oxygen was
continuously fed into the slurry at 500 mL/min through a microporous
sparger located 1 cm above the impeller in order to increase the
residence time of each bubble in the solution to allow a better oxygen
transfer rate. Sulfates have fast leaching rates, due to their direct
dissolution into the leachant (water) without chemical transformation
involved ( Yu et al., 2012 ).
Agitation was provided by an overhead sealed-shaft stirrer driven at a
constant speed of 600 rpm, to ensure full suspension of solids and tominimize external mass transfer resistance. The leaching time was
extended to 48 h, in order to assess its e ﬀect on the reaction mixture
and to establish equilibrium conditions. To prevent further reaction withthe leached material which may have been carried over from the process,
aliquots of 3 mL were collected at speci ﬁc timed intervals through
Fig. 5. Particle size distribution of the chromite-rich ore after ring-mill micronization.

ICP-MS. The leach residue was washed thoroughly several times with
distilled water to remove any physically attached ions or any unreacted
ligands (reagents), and then ﬁltered under vacuum using Whatman No1
paper, oven-dried at 50 °C for 72 h, and kept until required.
3.2.4. Leaching reactor
The batch vessel used in this work was a 1500 mL (working volume)
double jacketed glass reactor provided with a tapering conical bot-
tom—100 mm interior diameter, 243 mm in height —ﬁtted with four
symmetrically ﬁxed ba ﬄes and water inlet/outlet connected to a
temperature-controlled water bath. The conical con ﬁguration facilitates
good mixing. The ﬂow pattern gives adequate solid suspension. Singh
et al. (2011) argued that reactors with conical bottoms have satisfactory
ﬂow patterns, owing to very low o ﬀbottom clearance of the impeller.
The vessel had openings in the lid to introduce a dispersion tube for
oxygen and a pH electrode, to withdraw solution samples, and a centralopening to ﬁx an anchor propeller stirrer for mixing the solution. The
reactor was also equipped with a mercury thermometer and a cooling
reﬂux condenser connected to a chilled water line that allows contin-
uous return of volatile materials to the reaction mixture, reducingevaporation losses of essential ingredients as oxygen (99% purity) was
bubbled throughout the tests. To maintain the water balance, evapora-
tion losses were compensated by adding distilled water before sam-
pling. All open ports on the lid were plugged with rubber stoppers to
seal the reactor.
4. Results and discussion
The use of resolution (IV) design prevents main factors from being
aliased with any other main e ﬀects as well as two-factor interactions.
Contrariwise main e ﬀects are aliased with third- and higher order
interactions. However, second-order interactions are aliased with each
other ( Zolgharnein and Shahmoradi, 2010 ). Thereby, current fractional
factorial design allows independent estimation of individual maineﬀect, as it is often true that high-order interactions (triple or above)tend to become negligible ( Tinoco et al., 2011 ). The ranking of the
importance of each factor and/or interaction in the overall processdepends on the numerical value of the coe ﬃcient of each factor or its
interaction in absolute value ( Passos et al., 2006 ).
4.1. Screening important factors
Main factor analysis ( Table 5) shows the e ﬀect of each individual
factor on the measured responses. It should be noted that H
2SO4
addition was the most in ﬂuential factor among all others. Nickel
dissolution apparently outpaced that of copper at a comparatively
low H 2SO4concentration ( ≈462 kg/t ore), which is probably due to
the easier decomposition of the nickel phases; pentlandite and ram-melsbergite ( Table 4).
The decrease of copper extraction with the increase of roasting
temperature is not consistent with the higher decomposition tempera-
ture of copper sulfates which is in the range of 650 –700 °C. The decline
may be attributed to the partial decomposition of corresponding coppersulfates at higher temperatures ( Guo et al., 2009 ).
The eutectic in the NiSO
4-Na 2SO4system is at approximately 670 °C
(Yu et al., 2014b ), which is above current roasting temperatures. This
may explain the non-involvement of Na 2SO4in nickel sulfation.
Basturkcu and Acarkan (2016) stated that the catalytic activity of
Na2SO4depends on its dosage and reaction temperature. In this context,
nickel extraction without Na 2SO4addition was found to be 87.1% (not
shown graphically) with a decrease in H 2SO4addition from 462 to
428.57 kg/t ore in order to preserve the weight percent calculations.
The leaching temperature and duration had a positive e ﬀect on
nickel extraction. It should be noted that increasing the temperature
makes any passivation layer less stable ( Bahamòndez et al., 2016).
However, excessive extraction time might not be e ﬀective for the
extraction process because, from an industrial point of view, longerextraction time means lower e ﬃciency of equipment utilization.
Oxygen bubbling at the leach stage was the only factor not involvedin any response. This is consistent with the leaching of sulfate
compounds.Table 4

160An advantage of the sulfation roast-leach process is that the pH of
theﬁnal leach solution was approximately 2, which is bene ﬁcial for
downstream recovery processing of base metals. Such possibility of acid
regeneration accomplished through water reacting with residual SO 3
implies low acid consumption. This signi ﬁcantly reduces neutralization
costs as currently practiced in HPAL. Lastly, because the interest regions
of factors are di ﬀerent, several variables need to be controlled, i.e.,
reagent concentrations, roasting temperature, etc., there is conse-quently a need for a practical optimization of the roast-leach process.
4.2. Multiple response optimization technique4.2.1. Desirability function approach —Setting optimization criteria
The desirability function is a popular and established technique for
simultaneous determination of optimum settings of input variables that
can determine optimum performance levels for one or more responses
(Azharul et al., 2009 ). Desirability is an objective function that ranges
from zero outside the limits, to one at the goal. The approach is basedon the idea that, when one of the quality characteristics of an industrial
process or product with many characteristics is not in the desired limits,
then the entire quality of the industrial process or the product is not
desirable ( Pasandideh and Niaki, 2006).
The desired goal was selected by adjusting the weight or importance
that might alter its characteristics. Importance ranges from 1 to 5. It is a
tool for changing relative priorities to achieve established goals for
some or all variables. The individual desirability functions d
i–
generated based upon the type of each characteristic –are calculated
as shown in Eq. (23).

where L,Tstand for lower limit of the response ( yi) and its target value,
respectively.
The main e ﬀects of each factor upon responses were ascertained
through ANOVA. The results shown in Table 5 indicate that H 2SO4
concentration was the most signi ﬁcant process factor, due to its high
percentage contribution among other process parameters.
A weight ( w) can be assigned to each goal to adjust the shape of its
particular desirability function. Weight gives added emphasis to upper
and lower bounds or emphasizes target values. The maximum weight is
10. Selecting w> 1 places more emphasis on being close to the target
value, and selecting 0 < w< 1 makes this less important. The
individual desirabilities are then combined using the geometric mean,
which gives the overall desirability D expressed in Eq. (24).
D dy dy dy=[ ( )× ( )×… ( ) ] rrr11 221(24)
with ( r) denoting the number of responses.
Design-Expert ®software has inbuilt optimization tool. Table 6
shows the settings provided to the software package and the ﬁnal
result obtained in numerical optimization is tabulated in Table 7. There
were 100 solutions found but solution with the highest desirability and/
or yield was selected as ﬁnal result.
The bar graph depicted in Fig. 6 shows how well each variable
satisﬁed the criteria and the overall combined desirability. Values near
one are recommended. A value of one represents the ideal case, while azero indicates that one or more responses fall outside desirable limits.
4.2.2. Predicted optimal conditions
Under the optimized conditions as suggested by the present study
(81% overall desirability), 90.40% Ni and 69.45% Cu could theoreti-
cally be recovered through water-leach after 2 h of sulfation roast
(Table 7). However, the actual test ( Fig. 7) resulted in 89.86% Ni and
76.83% Cu extracted using 462 kg H
2SO4/t ore.
The results in Fig. 7 shows that most of the leaching occurred in theTable 5

161ﬁrst 60 min ( ﬁrst data point) achieving 86% Ni extraction. Small
increase (4%) was attained after 24 h and then the curve plateaued at
around 90%. Such a prolonged leaching may be bene ﬁcial in increasing
nickel extraction. However, the overall capacity of the plant and itsoperating costs may also increase following an extended process.
Thereby optimal duration should be selected based on whether the
extra nickel credit compensates the production expenses. Nevertheless
for research purposes only, 24 h was selected as the e ﬀective leaching
time to ensure complete equilibration.
4.3. Experimental error —Tests reproducibility
The accuracy of ﬁt of the model was checked by correlation
coeﬃcient and/or coe ﬃcient of variation (coe ﬃcient of variability orcoeﬃcient of variance). Note that the coe ﬃcient of variation (=
100∗standard deviation/mean) is a measure of the reproducibility of
a model ( Mohammed and Ahmad, 2010; Mpinga et al., 2014a ). A model
can be considered reasonably reproducible if its coe ﬃcient of variation
is not greater than 10% ( Chowdhury et al., 2012 ). It was observed in
this study that the coe ﬃcient of variation varies from 3.83 to 9.71%. To
establish the degree of reproducibility of the ﬁndings, four simulation
tests were performed under optimum conditions in Table 7. The
experimental error related to the reproducibility of the tests was
evaluated at ± 8% i.e., the precision and accuracy of the method were
satisfactory.
4.4. Empirical predictive ANOVA model
The fundamental objective of a factorial design is to develop a
predictive model. All experiments were performed according to statis-
tical designs, in order to develop predictive regression models used foroptimization. Response surface methodology (RSM) makes it possible to
represent independent process parameters in quantitative form as in Eq.
(25).
Y fX X X X ε =(,,, …) ± n 123 (25)
where Y is the response, f is the response function, εis the experimental
error and X 1,X 2,X 3,Xn, are independent parameters. The true
relationship between Y and X nmay be complicated and, in most cases,
it is unknown. It is noteworthy that the response surface methodology
does not elucidate the mechanism of the processes studied, but only
ascertains the e ﬀects of factors upon responses. After discarding
insigni ﬁcant terms i.e. terms having a probability p-value > 0.05, the
resultant models for describing base metal copper and nickel solubilisa-
tion, can be described in term of actual factors by Eqs. (26) and (27) .
Cu = +59.10−7.05B−5.38 C+ 5.98 E Extraction (26)
Ni = +74.35 + 7.38A−4.86 D+ 12.38 E+ 6.19 F Extraction (27)
Apart from correlation coe ﬃcients (R2), the closeness of ﬁt to the
experimental data can be tested either by normal probability plot of theresidual between the response and the prediction or by comparing the
experimental data against the data predicted by the models used for the
regression analysis ( Teng et al., 2012; Sheridan et al., 2002). With
regard to copper extraction, the Predicted (Pred) R-Squared of 0.91 is inreasonable agreement with the Adjusted (Adj) R-Squared of 0.85 i.e. theTable 6

162diﬀerence is less than 0.2. Similarly for nickel extraction, the Pred R-
Squared of 0.97 is also in reasonable agreement with the Adj R-Squared
of 0.93; i.e. the di ﬀerence is less than 0.2. Therefore, the models are
signiﬁcant for the solubilisation process of base metals.
4.5. Chemical and mineralogical characterization of calcine and leach
residues
Chemical and mineralogical changes brought by the sulfation roast-
water leach were identi ﬁed by means of ﬁre assay and TIMA.
Mineralogical examination ( Table 8) has indicated that more than
one-half of the calcines consisted of chromite. This is apparent on amicroscopic scale the fairly uniform chromite composition of the ore
and does not vary signi ﬁcantly from one particle to another. The
remainder was largely a mixture of chlorite –clinochlore and olivine.
There was no pentlandite or chalcopyrite in the calcines.
Mineralogical studies have also indicated that unleached platinum
in all leach residues was sperrylite. Note that the lowest meltingtemperature in the As-Pt system (eutectic) is approximately 597 °C
(Okamoto, 1990 ), which is higher than Panton ’s roasting temperature
of 550 °C (adopted in this work). Therefore, temperatures of more thanthe eutectic point are required to accelerate the thermal decomposition
of sperrylite. However, no Pd mineral was detected (TIMA) in either
sample, although the ore head sample contained 15.20 g/t and the
residue was upgraded.5. Conclusions
A fractional factorial design investigating the levels of H
2SO4
(sulfating agent), Na 2SO4(catalyst), roasting temperature, roasting
time, leaching temperature, oxygen addition at the leaching stage and
leaching duration on the dissolution e ﬃciency of various metals
including copper, nickel, iron, chromium and PGMs was conducted.Theﬁrst and most important conclusion that can be made is that nickel
and copper can e ﬀectively be leached from a complex, chromite-rich
Cu-Ni-PGM ore using a sulfation roast-leach method. The results
demonstrated that within the parameters of the experiments, the
amount of H
2SO4addition was the most in ﬂuential factor to control,
whereas the e ﬀect of Na 2SO4addition on Ni was not statistically
signiﬁcant.
Oxygen bubbling at the leach stage was the only factor not involved
in any response. This is consistent with the leaching of sulfate
compounds. The theoretical optimum conditions found were 30 wt%
(462 kg/t) H 2SO4, 5 wt% (76.92 kg/t) Na 2SO4,roasting temperature of
550 °C, roasting time of 120 min, leaching temperature of 80 °C and
leaching time of 1440 min to achieve 69.45% copper and 90.40% nickel
recovery. Actual test resulted in 89.86% Ni and 76.83% Cu extracted
with 462 kg H 2SO4consumed /t ore. The extraction of nickel without
Na2SO4addition (not from the predictive modelling) was found to be
87.1% with a decrease in H 2SO4addition from 462 to 428.57 kg/t ore
in order to preserve the weight percent calculations. The experimentalerror related to the reproducibility of the tests was evaluated at ± 8%
i.e., the precision of the method was satisfactory.
It is foreseen that the use of low temperature leaching at atmo-
spheric pressure will save considerable amount of energy thereby
minimising operating costs. While unconcentrated ore was used in the
roasting process, ideally the technique can use a rougher ﬂotation
product —a considerable amount of ore weight will be rejected —thus
reducing separation costs and saving valuable minerals (e.g. sperrylite)
that may be lost in making cleaner concentrates. Only a low percentage
of chromium and iron (10.40 and 13.60% in the ore, respectively)
accompanies copper and nickel as water-soluble sulfates (0.80 and
1.46%, respectively). Since chromite comprises about 78.12% of the
ore, any decrease in its solubilisation is of signi ﬁcance to the overall
process. High temperatures of more than 550 °C are required in order tobreak down bonds or at least modify the arsenide lattice to align
downward platinum recovery process.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This progress  report has been prepared  to outline key progress  made during the reporting 
period from 02 April 2018 until 01 October 2018 for the Mining Research Institute of Western 
Australia (MRIWA) project M0458, sponsored by Panoramic Resources Limited and Panton 
Sill Pty Ltd.  
The research associated with this project has been undertaken b y the Gold Technology Group, 
at Curtin University, and is aimed at developing a process for treating a PGM-bearing chromite 
ore in order to recover metal values contained therein on run-o f-mine ore material in oxidized 
mineralization derived from Panoramic Resources Panton deposit.   
This project commenced in 2015 and is scheduled for completion in October 2019. 
Research presented in Progress Reports 1 to 5 explored a number of options to extract and 
recover Platinum and Palladium from a PGM-bearing chromite ore, and a novel new extraction 
method that involved a chloride salt roast was developed. The n ew method demonstrated a 
leach beneficiation on ore averaging 99.7% platinum and 100% palladium , with relatively low 
co-extraction of deleterious chromium (0.31%). Weak-base anion- exchange resin 
diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulose was also found to be success ful for quantitative batch-
scale separation of Pt(IV) and Pd(II) from a large excess of various interfering cations and 
anions in chloride solutions.   
During the reporting period, Cleophace Mpinga completed his PhD thesis and it was submitted 
for examination on 07 July 2018. Results  were  received from the examiners on 30 October 
2018 and the thesis has passed subject to addressing the revisi ons required by the examiners.   
Laboratory work conducted during the reporting period focussed on the preparation of a PGM 
concentrate  that is to be used to test the salt roast  methodology  that was developed in this 
project and tested on PGM ore. A flotation recovery of 82.25% f or PGMs was achieved, with 
15 flotation tests carried out on 1 kg sample portions in a 2 l itre floatation cell. 
Laboratory work to be conducted during the next reporting period (i.e. Reporting Period 7) will 
apply the chloride salt roast PGM extraction methodology to PGM concentrate.  MRIWA Project M0458 Progress Report 5

1. INTRODUCTION
This progress report has been prepared to outline key progress made during the 
reporting period for the Mining Research Institute of Western Australia (MRIWA) 
project M0458, sponsored by Panoramic Resources Limited and Panton Sill Pty Ltd.  
The research associated with this project was undertaken by the  Gold Technology Group at 
Curtin University and was aimed at developing a process for tre ating a PGM-bearing chromite 
ore in order to recover metal values contained therein on run-o f-mine ore material in oxidized 
mineralization derived from Panoramic Resources Panton deposit.   
Research presented in Progress Reports 1 to 6 explored a number  of options to extract and 
recover Platinum and Palladium from a PGM-bearing chromite ore,  and a novel new extraction 
method that involved a chloride salt roast has been developed. The new method demonstrated 
a leach beneficiation averaging  99.7% platinum and 100% palladi um, with relatively low co-
extraction of deleterious chromium  (0.31%).  Weak-base  anion-exc hange  resin 
diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulose  was also found to be success ful for quantitative batch-
scale separation of Pt(IV)  and Pd(II)  from a large excess of various  interfering  cations  and 
anions in chloride solutions.   
Laboratory work conducted during the reporting period focussed on the preparation of a PGM 
concentrate that is to be used to test the salt roast  PGM extraction  methodology on a PGM 
concentrate.  A flotation recovery of 82.25% for PGMs  was achieved,  with 15 flotation tests 
carried out on 1 kg sample portions in a 2 litre floatation cell operating a rotation impeller speed 
of 900 rpm.   
This project commenced in 2015 and is scheduled for completion in October 2019.

3.2 Laboratory  
research 
Laboratory research during the reporting period focused on the preparation of a PGM 
concentrate by flotation. A report documenting progress to-date  preparing a concentrate 
included in Appendix 1.  
Rougher and rougher/scavenger flotation test work was conducted  on representative samples 
of Panton Sill deposit in order to test suitability of flotation in pre-concentrating the PGMs found 
in the samples and to select the best reagent dosage suit for o ptimum recovery. Flotation pulp 
was conditioned with different dosages of Sendep 30E as depress ant, Senkol 8 as primary 
collector and SIBX as co-collector.  
15 flotation tests were carried out on 1kg sample portions in a  2 litre flotation cell operating at 
a rotational impeller speed of 900 rpm. 82.25% recovery for PGMs was demonstrated with the 
mass pull of approximately 20% and 30 g/t PGMs. 
The flotation test work results show: 
In general, the PGMs found within the sample was slow floating .
By increasing the primary and co-collector dosage to 150 g/t, the slurry became more
reducing. The pulp potential decreased by at least 100 millivolts in rougher/scavenger
flotation feed. In this condition (flotation for 5 minute cumul ative time), only around 50%
of the PGMs were recovered with a mass pull of approximately 11 %.
By increasing the flotation time to 18 minute, increasing the dosage of the primary and
co-collector collector to 250 g/t (stage addition) to the flotation test work around 82.25%
of the PGMs were recovered with the mass pull of approximately 20%.
Table 1 summarised the results to-date. Based on the results, the best reagent dosage (rougher/scavenger) suite for optimal recovery was obtained usi ng PGM13  Conditions.

The research recommended the process outlined in Figure 1 for recovery of PGMs into a 
flotation concentrate.  
Figure 1: Proposed flow sheet of flotation 
The process would require the ore to be milled to P80% -52μm followed by a 
rougher/scavenger flotation.  The rougher and scavenger concentrates would be reground to a predetermined liberation size (P80%-38μm) and then subjected to two stages of cleaner flotation to produce a final flotation concentrate.

6.CONCLUSION/SUMMARY
MRIWA project 458 is progressing well. Promising results have been demonstrated for the 
extraction and recovery of Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) from the Panoramic Resources 
Panton deposit ore.   
Flotation work undertaken during the reporting period demonstrated that the ore is a slow 
floating ore. A PGM recovery of 82.25% was demonstrated with a mass pull of approximately 
20 per cent.  
Future work will focus on the application of the PGM extraction and recovery methodology that 
has been developed as part of this project to the PGM concentrate.  MRIWA Project M0458 Progress Report 5

Sendep 30E as depressant, Senkol 8 as primary collector and SIBX as co‐collector. All the flotation 
reagents supplied from SENMIN. A set of laboratory rougher/scavenger has been conducted on the 
ore sample ground to P80 of 52  µm.  
The flotation test w ork results show: 
 In general, the PGMs found within the sample was slow floating.   
 By increasing the primary and co ‐collector dosage to 150 g/t, t he slurry became more 
reducing.  The  pulp  potential  de creased  by  at  least  100  millivol ts  in  rougher/scavenger 
flotation feed. In this condition (flotation for 5 minute cumul ative time), only around 50% of 
the PGMs were recovered with a mass pull of ~11%.  
 By increasing the flotation time to 18 minute, increasing the dosage of the primary and co‐collector collector to 250 g/t (s tage addition) to the flotatio n test work around 82.25% of the 
PGMs were recovered with the mass pull~20%.

 1. Introduction 
Flotation recovery and concentra te grade from PGM bearing ores  depend largely on the mineralogy 
of the ore and the way the deposit is formed. From the benefici ation point of view, PGM‐bearing ores 
can be classified into the follo wing categories (Bulatovic, 200 3). 
 Deposits of magmatic origin, the PGMs are associated with base  metal sulphides, typical 
deposit: Merensky Reef in South Africa 
 Chromium deposits containing PGM minerals, the relationship bet ween chromium, the PGMs 
and  the  type  of  PGM  minerals  in  these  deposits  depends  largely  o n  t h e  g e o l o g i c a l  
environment. Therefore, the processing characteristics of these  ore types are variable . 
 High chromium oxidized PGM ores, these ores are found in Brazil  and Australia (Panton Sill). 
These ores belong to a group of highly refractory ores and usua lly give poor concentrate grade 
and PGMs recovery. The PGMs are either associated with oxidized  sulphides (pyrite, nickel), 
or partly present as PGM alloys.  
There has been little data published on the flotation of PGM‐be aring minerals, because this subject 
has been kept secret by the major PGMs producers. In this study, flotation reagents including collector 
(Senkol 8) and depressants (Sendep 30E), with co‐collector (SIB X) were employed for treatment of 
Panton Sill deposit sample. Result s from laboratory scale resea rch work using this reagents are 
presented in this report. The effect of reagent dosage, flotati on time and stage addition of the 
reagents on recovery and grade o f PGMs are discussed in detail.  
 
1.1. Objectives of test work 
The objectives of the proposed t est work were to investigate the following: 
 To find the optimum reagents dosage of 
o Primary collector (Senkol 8),  
o Co‐collector (SIBX) and  
o Depressant (Sendep30E).  
 To find the best flotation time Curtin University    Investigating the flotation performance of  Platinum Group Metals from Panton  Sill deposit

 2. Material and Methods  
2.1. Sample preparation  
The ore sample was crushed and ground to P80 percent passing ap proximately 52  µm. They were 
rotary‐split into 1.0 kilogram bag. This charge weight was chos en to ensure the correct pulp density in 
the flotation cell for  rougher flotation. 
2.2. Head assay 
A representative sample was submitted for head assay for: Plati num (P t), Palladium (P d), gold (Au), 
Nickle (Ni), Chromium (Cr), Copper (Cu) and sulphur (S). Table  1 shows the chemical assay of the head 
sample.

2.3. Method  
Rougher and rougher/scavenger flotation test work were carried  out on representative sample of 
Panton Sill deposit in order to test suitability of flotation i n pre‐concentrating the PGMs found in the 
samples and to select the best r eagent dosage suit for optimum  recovery.  In total, 11 reagent scouting 
flotation tests were carried out on 1kg sample portions in a 2  litre flotation cell operating at a 
rotational impeller  speed of 900 rpm.  
It should be noted that the PGM02 to PGM08 tests were only roug her flotation. PGM09 and PGM10 
were rougher/scavenger flotation.   Four timed rougher concentrates were collected for 0.5, 1.0, 1. 5 
and 2 minutes, for a total flotation time of 5 minutes. Three s cavenger flotation concentrates collected 
for 1, 2 and 2 minutes, for a total of 5 minutes.  
Also, below shows the flotation  time for PGM11 and PGM13 tests.   
PGM11: Rougher; 1, 1, 2 and 7 min for total of 11 min, Scavenge r; 2, 3 and 5 min for total of 10 min.

 Each concentrate was collected by hand scraping the froth from  the surface of the pulp once every 10 
seconds. The pulp chemistry (Eh, pH and dissolved oxygen) was r ecorded throughout the test work. 
Tap water was added during flota tion to maintain the pulp level  in the flotation ce ll. The wet weights 
of all concentrates and tailing s amples were recorded to enable  the water recovery to be calculated. 
These samples were subsequently filtered and dried. The dry sam ples were submitted for assay. The 
flotation conditions tested are  summarised in Table 2 and 3. Th e flotation test sheets are provided in

The best results were obtained using PGM13 condition (increasin g the flotation reagents and stage 
addition). Using these conditions, ~82.25% of the PGMs were rec overed into a concentrate of mass 
pull 20.22% at a concentrate grade of 29.21 g/t PGMs. Table 5 p resents the result s obtained using 
PGM13 condition.   
In general, the PGMs found within the Panton Sill deposit sampl e was slow floating with only ~50% 
of the total PGMs recovered into a 12% mass at a concentrate gr ade of ~35 g/t PGMs within the 
first 5 minutes of cumulative flotation time. Floating for an additional 10 minutes resulted in an 
average of ~60% of the total PGMs being recovered into a ~25% c umulative mass at an average 
concentrate grade of 25 g/t PGMs. There was flotation recovery  achieved after 15 minutes of 
cumulative flotation time showing that there were significant quantities of slow floating PGMs within the samples.

platinum curves in Figure 3, it is apparent that increasing the  dosage of primary co llector (10 to 50 g/t) 
results in an improvement (around 25% increase) in recovery.

The platinum recovery curves for the rougher/scavenger flotatio n tests are shown in Figures 4. It can 
be seen that increasing the flotation time, adding scavenger an d stage addition of the reagent 
improved the recovery of platinum.

improved the PGMs recovery. 
 
4. Conclusions  
The flotation test wor k results show that: 
 In general, the PGMs found within the sample was slow floating.   
 By increasing the primary and co ‐collector dosage to 150 g/t, t he slurry became more 
reducing.  The  pulp  potential  de creased  by  at  least  100  millivol ts  in  rougher/scavenger 
flotation feed. In this condition only around 50% of the PGMs were recovered with a mass pull 
of 11%.  
 By increasing the flotation time  to 18 min and stage addition of the reagents to the flotation 
test work the PGMs recovery increased to 82.25% with the mass p ull~22%.

 5. Recommendations 
The test work results obtained indicated that the Panton Sill d eposit sample was a slow floating PGMs 
ore. Based on these results, the author recommends below proces s for recovery of PGMs into a 
flotation concentrate. Propose d flowsheet is illustrated in Fig ure 10. 
 
Figure 10.  Proposed flow sheet of flotation   
The process would require the ore to be milled to P80%‐52μm fol lowed by a rougher and rougher 
scavenger  flotation  with  a  cleaning  and  one  stage  Re‐cleaning.  It  should  be  noted  that  the 
rougher/scavenger concentrates will  be UFG to P80%‐38μm before cleaning stages.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This progress report has been prepared to outline key progress  made during the reporting period from 
02 October 2018 until 01 April 2019 for the Mining Research Institute of Western Australia (MRIWA) 
project M0458, sponsored by Panoramic Resources Limited and Panton Sill Pty Ltd.  
The research associated with this project has been undertaken b y the Gold Technology Group, at Curtin 
University, and is aimed at developing a process for treating a  PGM‐bearing chromite ore in order to 
recover metal values contained therein on run‐of‐mine ore mater ial in oxidized mineralization derived 
from Panoramic Resources Panton  deposit. Thi s  project  commenced  in  2015  and  is  scheduled  for  
completion in October 2019. 
Research  presented  in  Progress  Reports  1  to 6 expl ored  a  number  of  options  to  float,  extract  and  
recover Platinum and Palladium from a PGM‐bearing chromite ore,  and a new extraction method that 
involved  a  conventional  roasting  and  HCl/NaCl/H 2O2 leaching  was  developed. The new method  
demonstrated a leach beneficiati on on float concentrate averagi ng 97% platinum, 90% palladium and 
97% gold  with relatively low  co‐extraction of  deleterious  chromium  followed by  PGMs precipitation 
with NaSH and Cu/Ni precipitatio n with increasing the pH with C aCO3 and MgO to produce a Mixed 
Hydroxide  Precipitant  of  Nickel/Copper/Cobalt  which  also  found  to be  successful  for batch‐scal e  
separation of PGMs and base metals from a large excess of vario us interfering cations and anions in 
chloride solutions.

1. INTRODUCTION
This progress report has been prepared to outline key progress  made during the reporting period for 
the  Mining  Research  Institute  of  Western  Australia  (MRIWA)  project  M0458,  sponsored  by 
Panoramic Resources Limited and Panton Sill Pty Ltd.  
The research associated  with this project was undertaken  by the Gol d Technology Group at Curti n 
University and was aimed at developing a process for treating a PGM‐bearing chromite ore in order to 
recover metal values contained therein ore material in oxidized  mineralization derived from Panoramic 
Resources Panton deposit.  
Research presented in Progress Reports 1 to 6 explored a  number of options to extract and recover 
Platinum and Palladium from a PGM‐bearing chromite ore, and a n ew extraction method that involved 
a  conventional  roasting  followed  by  HCl/NaCl/H 2O2  has  been  developed  and  conducted  on  the  
flotation concentrate. The new method demonstrated a leach bene ficiation averaging 97% platinum 
and 90% palladium, with relatively low co‐extraction of deleter ious chromium. Precipitation method 
was also found to be successful for batch‐scale separation of P GMs and base metals from a large excess 
of various interfering cations a nd anions in chloride solutions .   
This project commenced in 2015 and is scheduled for completion  in October 2019. 
2. REPORTING PERIOD
This report presents research undertaken during the contract re porting period 2 October 2018 to 01 
April 2019, with some research u ndertaken after t hen contract p eriod of 01 April 2019.  
3. KEY PROGRESS DURING T HE REPORTING PERIOD
3.1 Laboratory research 
Laboratory research during the re porting period focused on the preparation of a PGM concentrate by 
flotation  and  applying  the  extraction  and  precipitation  process  on  the  float   concentrate.  Reports  
documenting progress to‐date included in Appendixes 1.  
3.1.1. Flotation results  
Rougher  and  rougher/scavenger  flotation  test  work  was  conducted   on  representative  samples  of  
Panton Sill deposit in order to test suitability of flotation i n pre‐concentrating the PGMs found in the MRIWA Project M0458 Progress Report 7 
Panton project           	3	
samples  and  to  select  the  best  reagent  dosage  suit  for  optimum  recovery.  Flotation  pulp  was 
conditioned with two flotat ion regimes as follows:  
1‐ Flotation with SENMIN reagents:  Different dosages of Sendep 30 E as depressant, Senkol 8 as 
primary collector and S IBX as co‐collector.  
2‐ Flotation with Cytec reagents: Sulphidisation the mill discharg e sample with Sodium dithionite 
and pulp conditioned with copper sulphate as an activator, SIPX  as primary collector, AP3477 
and A3418 as promoter and MIBC as frother. 
A series of flotation tests were carried out on Panton Sill sam ples and the flotation cell operating at a 
rotational impeller speed of 1000  rpm. The best results from ea ch of the flotation regimes summarized 
below:  
Flotation with SENMIN reagents a t P80=38 micron (SENDEP 30E as  depressant, SENKOL 8 a s
co‐collectors, SIBX as primary collector  and SENFROTH as froth er): Rougher and scavenger
flotation for 22 minute shows ~ 82% recovery with ~20% mass pull  and PGMs grade of 30 g/t.
The results from this flotation test work program filed in February 2019 progress report.
Sulphidisation with sodium dithionite and flotation with Cytec reagents at P80=30 micron
(copper sulphate as activator, AP3417, A3418 as promoter, SIPX  as primary collector  and MIBC
as frother): Rougher and scavenger flotation for 29 minute show s ~80% recovery with ~5%

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Flotation test work were carried  out on representative sample o f Panton Sill deposit in order 
to test suitability of flotation in pre‐concentrating the PGM S and to select the best reagent 
regime and dosage suit for optimum recovery.  Flotation pulp wa s conditioned with different 
dosage of SENMIN and Cytec flotation reagents (SENMIN: Sendep 3 0E as depressant, Senkol 
8 as primary collector and SIBX as co‐collector Cytec: AP3477,  A3418 as promoter, SIPX as 
collector,  MIBC  as  frother,  copper  sulphide  as  activator  and  So dium  Dithionite  as 
sulphidisation reagent). A set of laboratory rougher/scavenger  has been conducted on the 
ore sample ground from P80 of 52 µm up to 30µm.  The flotation  test work results show that 
by employing the SENMIN flotation reagents, increasing the prim ary and co‐collector dosage 
to 150 g/t, increasing the flotation time to 22 min, adding sca venger, stage addition of the 
reagents to the flotation test work most of the PGMs were recov ered and produced a 
concentrate with an overall recovery of ~82%, mass pull of ~20  % and concentrate grade of 
~30g/t PGE. However, when the flotation pulp was conditioned wi th sodium dithionate as a 
sulphidisation reagent, copper su lphide as an activator, Cytec  reagents as promoter (AP3418 
and A3477) and SIPX as primary co llector shows a better perform ance in terms of grade and 
mass pull. It was found that around ~80% of the PGE were recove red into a concentrate with 
a mass pull 5% at a concentr ate grade of 120 g/t PGE.

1. Introduction 
Flotation recovery from PGM bearing ores depend on the mineralo gy of the ore and the way 
the deposit is formed. From the beneficiation point of view, PG M‐bearing ores can be 
classified into the following categories: (1) Deposits of magma tic origin, where the PGMs are 
associated with base metal sulphides, typical deposit: Merensky  Reef in South Africa; (2) 
Chromium deposits containing PGM minerals, where the relationsh ip between chromium, the 
PGMs and the type of PGM minerals in these deposits depends lar gely on the geological 
environment. Therefore, the processing characteristics of these  ore types are quite variable; 
(3) High chromium oxidized PGM ores, these ores are found in Br azil and Australia. These ores 
belong to a group of highly refractory ores and usually give po or concentrate grade and PGMs 
recovery. The PGMs are either associated with oxidized sulphide s (pyrite, nickel), or partly 
present as PGM alloys (Bulatovic,  2003; Chapman et al., 2011). 
Apart from several publications on the Stillwater, there has be en little data published on the 
flotation of chromium‐rich oxidised PGM ore.  The objectives of  the proposed test work were 
to investigate the following: (1) To quantify the role of sulphidisation with dithionite and cytec 
promoter reagents (Ap3477 and A3418) on the flotation performan ce (2) To quantify the role 
of primary collector (Senkol 8), co‐collector (SIBX) and depres sant (Sendep30E) on the pulp 
chemistry and flotation performance; (3) To find the best flotation regimes suit for optimum 
recovery (4) to find the optimum flotation time of rougher and  scavenger. Results from 
laboratory scale research work are presented in this report. The effect of sulphidisation, 
reagent dosage (Cytec and SENMIN), flotation time and stage add ition of the reagents on 
recovery and grade of PGMs are discussed in detail. 
 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Head assay  A representative sample of Panton Sill ore was submitted for he ad assay for: Platinum (P
t), 
Palladium (P d), gold (Au), Nickle (Ni), Chromium (Cr), Copper (Cu) and sulphur (S). Table 1 
shows the chemical assay of the head sample.  PGMs: The sum of the assays of 3 PGMs (P

2.2. Method  Rougher/scavenger flotation test  work were carried out with two  flotation regimes (SENMIN 
and Cytec) on representative sample of Panton Sill deposit in order to test suitability of 
flotation in concentrating the PGMs found in the samples and to  select the best reagent 
regimes and dosage suit for opti mum recovery. A number of reage nt scouting flotation tests 
were carried out on the Panton  Sill deposit samples. Each conce ntrate was collected by hand 
scraping the froth from the surface of the pulp. The pulp chemistry (Eh, pH and dissolved oxygen) was recorded throughout the test work. Tap water was ad ded during flotation to 
maintain the pulp level in the flotation cell. The wet weights  of all concentrates and tailing 
samples were recorded to enable  the water recovery to be calculated. These samples were 
subsequently filtered and dried. The dry samples were submitted  for assay. The flotation 
conditions tested are summari sed in Table 2 and 3.

3.1.1. SEMIN reagents  
The flotation results when the SENMIN reagents used show that t he PGMs found within the 
samples  were  slow  floating.  The  best  results  were  obtained  usin g  PGM13  condition 
(increasing the flotation reagents and stage addition). Using t hese conditions, ~82.25% of the 
PGMs were recovered into a concentrate of mass pull 20.22% at a concentrate grade of 29.21 g/t PGMs. Table 5 and 6 presents  the test condition and the res ults obtained using PGM13 
condition. In these conditions, only ~50% of the total PGMs rec overed into a 12% mass at a 
concentrate grade of ~35 g/t PGMs within the first 5 minutes of  cumulative flotation time. 
Floating for an additional 10 minutes resulted in an average of  ~60% of the total PGMs being 
recovered into a ~25% cumulative mass at an average concentrate  grade of 25 g/t PGMs. 
There was flotation recovery achieved after 15 minutes of cumul ative flotation time showing 
that there were significant quantities of slow floating PGMs wi thin the samples.

 3.1.2. Sulphidisation and Cytec reagents  
The effects of sulphidisation with sodium dithionite and using Cytec flotation reagent (A3477 
and Ap3418) on flotation performance of PGMs have been investigated. The best results obtained when the ore ground to P80=30µm and the pulp condition ed with 1970 g/t sodium 
dithionate (adjust potential to ‐400mV), 50 g/t copper sulphate , 36 g/t AP3418, 36 g/t A3477 
and 200 g/t SIPX. In this condition, ~80% of the PGMs were reco vered into a concentrate with 
a mass pull of 5% at a concentrate grade of 120 g/t PGMs. Table  7 and 8 present the flotation 
condition and the results obtained using FDP07 condition.  
In general, with this condition the PGMs were fast floating wit h ~70% of the total PGMs

 3.2. Platinum Recovery  
The platinum recovery curves for the rougher/scavenger flotatio n tests are shown in Fig. 1. 
(1) When the flotation pulp were conditioned with the SENMIN re agents and (2) when the 
flotation pulp were conditioned with sodium dithionite (as sulp hidisation reagent) and Cytec 
reagents. It can be seen when the SENMIN reagents employed, the platinum found within the 
samples were slow floating which by increasing the flotation ti me, adding scavenger and stage 
addition of the reagent improved the platinum recovery. However, when the flotation pulp were conditioned with sodium dithionite (as sulphidisation reag ent) and the Cytec flotation 
reagents used the platinum recovery improved and slow floating  platinum changed to fast 
floating material. As it can be seen in the optimum condition a lmost 72% of the platinum 
recovered in the first six minute of cumulative flotation time  and in a mass pull of ~3% with 
80g/t Pt. However, when the SENMIN reagents used and without su lphidisation in the 
optimum condition the flotation produce a concentrate with a  m ass pull of ~20% and 10 g/t

 3.3. Palladium Recovery   
The palladium recovery curves for the rougher/scavenger flotati on test is shown in Fig. 2. It 
can be seen when the SENMIN reagent employed, the Palladium fou nd within the samples 
were slow floating which by increasing the flotation time, addi ng scavenger and stage 
addition of the reagent improved the palladium recovery. However, when the flotation pulp 
were conditioned with sodium dithionite (as a sulphidisation re agent) and the Cytec flotation 
reagents used the flotation performance improved and slow float ing palladium changed to 
fast floating material. As it can be seen in the optimum condition almost 70% of the palladium recovered in the first six minut e of cumulative flotation time  with a mass pull of ~3% and 
82g/t P
d. However, when the SENMIN reagents used and without sulphidisa tion in the 
optimum condition the flotation produce a concentrate with a ma ss pull of ~20% and 12 g/t

 3.4. Gold Recovery   
The gold recovery curves for the rougher/scavenger flotation test is shown in Fig. 3. It can be 
seen when the SENMIN reagent emp loyed, the gold found within the samples were slow 
floating which by increasing the flotation time, adding scaveng er and stage addition of the 
reagents improved the gold recov ery. However, when the flotatio n pulp sulphidised with 
sodium dithionite and Cytec flotation reagents used the flotati on performance improved and 
slow floating gold changed to fast floating material. As it can  be seen in the optimum condition 
almost 62% of the gold recovered in the first six minute of flo tation time in a mass pull of ~3% 
and 10g/t Au. However, when the SENMIN reagents employed and wi thout sulphidisation in 
the optimum condition the flotati on produce a concentrate with  a  mass pull of ~20% and 
1.25 g/t Au.

 4. Recommendations 
The test work results obtained indicated that the sulphidisation process can improve the 
flotation performance of the slow floating PGMs.  Based on thes e results, recommends below 
process for recovery of PGMs into a flotation concentrate. Prop osed flowsheet is illustrated 
in Fig. 4.  
 
 
     Fig. 4. Proposed flow sheet of flotation   
The process would require the o re to be milled to P80%~30μm fol lowed by a rougher and two 
stages of scavenger flotation.
