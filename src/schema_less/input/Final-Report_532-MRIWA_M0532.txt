iiiExecutive Summary
Western Australia currently contributes around 55% of the world’s lithium (Li) production (USGS, 2022). With 
increasing use in the production of Li-ion batteries (LIBs) used to power electric vehicles, the projected global demand for Li is expected to exceed supply by about 2025. Moreover, the transition to increased renewable energy 
production and utilization will require significant LIB storage capabilities to balance regional electricity grids.
While there are some research publications available on individual LCT (Li, Cs, Ta) pegmatite deposits, there 
has been no systematic comparative study on Li-ore systems across Western Australia to date. The aim of this work was to develop a geometallurgical framework for Western Australia Li-pegmatite deposits for the purpose of providing fundamental knowledge of Li-orebodies and improving exploration targeting, mineral processing 
and chemical refining techniques. 
The main deliverables and key outcomes from this project were to:
1/ Develop a geological catalogue and database of all LCT pegmatite mineral systems in Western Australia, 
and compare and contrast these with global equivalents
The geology of LCT pegmatites in Western Australia was assessed in terms of their formation, texture and 
deposition. Field studies and a sample acquisition program targeted 10, state-wide LCT pegmatites from the Southern Yilgarn (Greenbushes and Mt Cattlin), Eastern Yilgarn (Bald Hill, Mt Marion, Sinclair Caesium Deposit, 
Dome North, Londonderry, Dalgaranga and Kathleen Valley) and Pilbara Cratons (Pilgangoora).
Mineral mapping established mineral–textural relationships to identify the principal Li host to aid pegmatite 
classification and aid in understanding the emplacement history, mineral crystallization pathways and genetic associations. All Li deposits investigated in this study form part of the LCT pegmatite family, with sub- types 
classified as follows:
 • Spodumene sub-type (Greenbushes, Kathleen Valley, Dome North and Mt Marion)
 •Petalite sub-type (Londonderry)
 •Lepidolite sub-type (Sinclair Caesium)
 •Albite–spodumene type (Mt Cattlin, Bald Hill and Pilgangoora) 
 •Albite-type (Dalgaranga) pegmatites.
Geochronology studies provided new zircon U–Pb ages and established that all Western Australian (WA) LCT pegmatites were emplaced during a relatively narrow window in time from 2643 to 2629 Ma. However, the relatively low U content (usually <100 ppm but also <<500 ppm) and relatively small grain size (predominantly 
<100 µm) of zircon analysed in the current study suggest they are inherited and did not crystallize in the 
pegmatite. Thus, zircon U–Pb ages place a maximum age constraint on the timing of pegmatite crystallization (i.e. pegmatites must be younger than the rock into which they intrude).
These ages support previous work pointing to a major period of global pegmatite emplacement from 2650 
to 2600 Ma. A significant new finding was a revised zircon U–Pb age of 2645 ± 4 Ma for the Greenbushes 
Deposit,  which is much older than earlier work indicating an age of 2527 Ma. 
40Ar/39Ar dating of spodumene 
was attempted without success. However, musc ovite plateau ages indicate that it took up to 40 million years 
for the pegmatite to cool to temperatures around 300 °C suggesting that they were originally emplaced at mid-crustal levels.iv2/ Produce a quantitative understanding of the mineralogical deportment of both economic (e.g. Li, Ta, Nb) 
and deleterious (e.g. Fe, Mn, F) elements in WA-pegmatitic deposits, and identify factors that may improve or inhibit the economic recovery of Li.
A combination of analytical techniques (SEM-EDS automated mineralogy, laser-ablation inductively coupled 
plasma–mass spectrometry, focused ion beam-scanning electron microscope/time-of-flight secondary 
ion mass spectrometry) was used in mineralogical and geochemical assessment of pegmatite samples. The megacrystic nature of spodumene at Mt Cattlin and Bald Hill suggests these pegmatites crystallized from a melt relatively enriched in fluxing agents (H
2O, B, F, P , Be) relative to the other deposits studied, where 
spodumene was less coarsely crystalline. Compositional trends (K, Rb, Cs, F, Ta) in muscovite–lepidolite–mica are controlled by the degree of magmatic fractional crystallization, and the use of mica chemistry as an 
exploration targeting tool looks promising. 
Two key types of spodumene alteration were observed with the potential to negatively impact ore quality and 
processing efficiency as follows:
 •Dark-green to black, pseudo-morphic replacement of spodumene by massive muscovite (sericite) ± chlorite assemblages are common in zones of post-emplacement hydrothermal alteration. This alteration leads to loss of Li in spodumene and concomitant increases in K, Fe, Mg, Rb and Mn.
 •Spodumene–quartz–alkali–feldspar symplectites are quite common across all pegmatite types.  
This alteration also leads to the loss of Li.
3/ Provide industry with independent verification of the suitability of field portable devices (e.g. laser-
induced breakdown spectroscopy) for determining Li abundance and distribution at exploration sites and 
during drilling operations. 
A laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) study of well-characterized Li-bearing samples was undertaken 
to determine if the technology could be applied in exploration and mining. Using partial least squares analysis , 
a multi-variate statistical approach of a LIBS analysis was found to produce semi-quantitative results. 
Quantitative analysis of Li ores is hampered by the fine-scale nature of spodumene alteration products,  
surface heterogeneities and chemical matrix effects.
4/ Develop a practical geometallurgical model that optimizes the development of Li deposits.
Test work on liberation characteristics, calcination and sulphate leach tests were carried out. The data 
was then used to develop an understanding of metallurgical properties of different pegmatites to aid in the geometallurgical assessment.
(a) Miner al liberation studies 
A systematic study of the liberation characteristics of four LCT pegmatites (Mt Cattlin, Bald Hill, Greenbushes and Pilgangoora) found that Li is predominantly bound within spodumene, and to a lesser extent within Li–mica (lepidolite and zinnwaldite) and petalite. Generally, the coarse nature of spodumene 
within a quartz–feldspar–muscovite matrix allows for >90% spodumene recovery, with expected Li grades 
above 3 wt%. Factors that limit recovery and grade include:
 •poorly liberated gangue minerals in spodumene in the form of graphic-textured spodumene–quartz–feldspar alteration intergrowth, or partially altered spodumene containing disseminated mica and mica veinlets.
 •gangue minerals with specific gravity similar to spodumene diluting the concentrate in dense media and gravity circuits (as high as 20 wt% gangue minerals in concentrates).
Improved spodumene recovery could be achieved by separation of middlings containing high mica and/or 
quartz–feldspar contents and subjecting them to finer grinding. Techniques such as ore sorting can also be 
used to reduce mineral impurities to the beneficiation circuit.
Tantalum minerals are mainly associated with gangue minerals and can be concentrated separately from 
spodumene, whereas cassiterite (SnO
2) is associated with both spodumene and gangue requiring treatment 
in two separate process streams.v(b) Calcination a nd acid-bake studies
A two-stage calcination – sulphate-roast testing procedure was used to simulate and assess the Li 
extraction process. The α–β conversion of spodumene for all ore types was found to occur between 1050 and 1100 °C. The oxidation of Fe and Mn within spodumene during calcination can reduce the calcination 
transformation temperature. These temperatures exceed the melting point of micaceous and feldspathic 
gangue minerals, which are commonly present in spodumene concentrates. During calcination, silicate melt products can potentially:
 •contribute to glass clinker formation in the calcine roaster leading to production delays and increased maintenance costs 
 •form glassy coatings around spodumene that can impede β-spodumene conversion and render-coated spodumene refractory to chemical leaching.
Other issues recognized include:
 •the exothermic oxidation of Fe and Mn contaminants in spodumene can potentially lead to the uncontrolled production of fine particulates, which can potentially affect the refinery operations
 •mineral contaminants, such as quartz gangue, can act as a thermal insulator, which can affect heat transfer to spodumene.
Incomplete Li extraction during the acid-bake and water-leach stage can be attributed to:
 •incomplete conversion of α-spodumene to β-spodumene during calcination. 
 •reduced percolation rate of acid into β-spodumene containing fine particle agglomerates.
Industrial efficiencies can be achieved by minimizing gangue content in Li feedstocks, and the optimization of particle size and roasting time during the calcining process.
(c) Geometallur gical model development
A practical geometallurgical model was developed as a benchmarking tool to identify factors that favour or limit full recoveries in different ore types identified in the 10 pegmatite fields studied in Western Australia. The major issues and impediments for treating pegmatite orebodies and solutions provided cover the 
effects of mineralogy and specific details of equipment used to treat Li ores. The key factors important in 
selecting a processing option for treating ores are:
 •Lithium mineral host 
 •grain size of the Li-host 
 •impurities (Fe, Mn)
 •mineral textures, associations and alteration products.
5/ Aid in establishing a multi-institutional ‘Centre of Excellence’ to foster capability and capacity of Western Australian research institutions to conduct eMaterials-relevant research and provide new opportunities for student involvement in a rapidly developing high technology sector.
The mineralogical understanding and geochemical nature of many of the pegmatite ores presented in this 
report forms the basis for at least two follow-on applied research activities: 1) A geometallurgical research consultancy will be made available in the John de Laeter Centre to undertake work with industry linking ore body knowledge with improvements in the beneficiation and chemical processing efficiency of lithium minerals; 2) A ‘Trusted Supply Chain’ project underway in the Future Battery Industries CRC will test whether geochemical 
fingerprinting techniques can discriminate batteries produced from Australian ores.viAcknowledgements

EV materials deposits in Western Australia

Introduction
Lithium is an important commodity used in glass and ceramics (35%), rechargeable batteries (29%), 
lubricating grease (9%), air treatment by CO2 capture (5%), continuous casting mould flux powders (6%) and 
polymer production (5%). The demand for Li has increased significantly in recent years and is forecast to grow by 350% by 2030 because of its increasing use in the production of Li-ion batteries (LIBs) used to power 
electric vehicles (EVs), and grid storage (Tarascon, 2010; Grosjean et al., 2012; Mohr et al., 2012; Cano et al., 
2018; Wietelmann and Klett, 2018). Government incentives, designed to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, are helping to drive the increasing demand for lithium.
The largest concentrations of Li minerals (spodumene, petalite, lepidolite and zinnwaldite) are found in 
granitic pegmatites in Australia, Canada, Zimbabwe and China (Fig. 1). Tantalum–niobium phases (e.g. 
columbite and tantalite) and rare earth minerals often associated with these deposits are potential industrial 
byproducts. A large lepidolite resource in Yichun, Jiangxi province of China, is currently obtained as flotation tailings of Ta and Nb (Guo et al., 2019). Other important sources of Li come from low-grade brine solutions found in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, China and the United States. Other Li-bearing minerals found in secondary mineral deposits (e.g. hectorite and jadarite) are also being investigated for commercial production (e.g. 
Jadar Li-borate deposit in Serbia), although Li-bearing clays, such as found in volcano-sedimentary rocks, 
are often of lower grade and are difficult to process. Pegmatites have a wider geographic distribution than brines, are less susceptible to supply disruptions and have high-grade Li compositions, which make them more flexible to market changes (Kesler et al., 2012).

Wells et al.Nature and types of pegmatites
Granitic pegmatites are well known and important 
sources of rare metals including Li, Sn, Ta, Nb, Be, Cs, Rb, Sc, Th, U and rare earths (London, 2008). Although 
granitic pegmatites are common and widespread, only 
approximately 0.1% are rare-element pegmatites, with Li-rich pegmatites only making up a fraction of rare-metal pegmatites (Laznicka, 2006). Almost all Li-rich pegmatites 
contain other rare metals such as Sn, Be, Ta and Nb (Kesler 
et al., 2012). Pegmatites have been categorized into five groups of which the rare-element pegmatite group can be further classified into the NYF(niobium, yttrium, fluorine)  and LCT(lithium, caesium, tantalum) pegmatite families, 
based on different mineral assemblages and textures as 
illustrated in Figure 2.
Pegmatites are igneous rocks that form during the final 
stage of magma crystallization under conditions that favour large crystals of felsic minerals. They either form 
concentric-zoned or alternating coarse-grained and fine-
grained layer-structured deposits. Fluorine, Li, Ta, Cs, Rb and rare earths, which are incompatible in minerals formed in the early-stage magma crystallization, can be concentrated and crystallized in such deposits (Bradley 
and McCauley, 2013). LCT pegmatites are usually related 
to fractionated (termed fertile or specialized) granites and may occur sporadically within less evolved S-type granite pegmatite bodies. The identification of mineral 
fractionation trends within granitic rocks is an important 
step in evaluating LCT pegmatite potential on a regional scale. For example, the use of Rb:K and Cs:K ratios of pegmatitic K-feldspars and muscovite can provide a measure of the degree of fractionation of a pegmatite 
(Selway et al., 2005; Linnen et al., 2012), as well as the 
Ta:Nb ratio of columbite–tantalite oxides (e.g. Shaw et al., 2016). The colour and geochemistry of garnets (Mn vs Fe), tourmaline (Li, Mn), muscovite (Sn) and beryl minerals that 
may also be present in pegmatites has also been used to 
establish fractionation of pegmatites (Selway et al., 2005).Lithium deposits in Western 
Australia
Lithium deposits and prospects (and Ta-ores containing 
Li) are known to occur at six major locations in Western Australia as shown in Figure 3. The main documented 
lithium deposits occur at: 
Rare-element group of pegmatites 
NYF (Nb, Y, F, rare earth) pegmatites LCT (Li, Cs, Ta) pegmatites 
LCT complex pegmatites
Heterogenous, distinctly zoned pegmatites in 
which the diﬀerent zones have diﬀerent and distinct mineral compositions and textures. A 
range of lithium minerals are usually present but are often found in separate zonesLCT albite–spodumene pegmatites
Homogenous and unzoned pegmatites 
comprised of ~25% randomly oriented 
spodumene crystals in a quartz–albite matrix, 
with minor micaLCT albite pegmatites
Heterogenous, zoned pegmatites with a 
central zone comprised of albite. They contain 
some spodumene, lithium phosphate minerals and some lithian muscovite, lepidolite, 
zinnwaldite or all three 
ŸAmblygonite pegmatites : abundant in amblygonite or 
montebrassite, associated by triphyllite/lithiophyllite, all 
varieties of lithium phosphates, with minor micas present 
ŸLepidolite pegmatites: abundant in lepidolite, occurring mainly 
as distinct zones bordering a quartz core. Zinnwaldite may be 
locally abundant. Usually contains high concentrations of boron 
associated with tourmaline formation, including elbaite. Minor 
amounts of petalite or spodumene may be present ŸSpodumene pegmatites: distinct spodumene-rich zones with 
some lepidolite or amblygonite/montebrassite associations. Separate lepidolite-rich zones may be present 
ŸPetalite pegmatites: distinct petalite-rich zones with some alteration mineral associations which can include spodumene. Qualities of lepidolite are always present and commonly existing 
in separate zones

Australia’s economically defined lithium resources 
(estimated at 15.2  M tonnes) occur exclusively within hard-rock pegmatite deposits, within the Archean Yilgarn and Pilbara Cratons of Western Australia. Rare-element 
pegmatites are known in other districts in Proterozoic 
terrains throughout Australia, such as the Curnamona, Arunta and Pine Creek provinces (e.g. Pollard, 2017) but all current Li production to date is from WA LCT pegmatites. The JORC defined resource estimates, as collated by the 
Geological Survey of Western Australia (GSWA) for the 
different pegmatite deposits, are shown in Table 1.
A comparison of the Li grade and size of resources in 
Australia compared with other major hard-rock Li-bearing deposits is shown in Figure 4. The Greenbushes lithium 
mine is the world’s largest and highest grade spodumene

Wells et al.project in Democratic Republic of Congo in Africa (AVZ 
minerals), where Li occurs as spodumene. Both deposits are undertaking feasibility studies and are not operational.
The pegmatite fields of Western Australia were known 
to mineralogists from the early 1900s as a source of 
gem-quality beryl, tourmaline, petalite and other lithium minerals (Jacobson et al., 2007). Most pegmatites in Western Australia are hosted by Archean mafic–ultramafic 
greenstone belts that have experienced upper greenschist 
to lower amphibolite metamorphism (e.g. Greenbushes, Kathleen Valley, Mt Marion and Londonderry). However, other deposits, such as Bald Hill and Dome North, intrude metasedimentary sequences. Regardless, as pegmatite 
emplacement post-dates the host rock, the depth in the crust 
at which emplacement occurred and the P–T conditions to 
which the pegmatite was subjected does not necessarily correspond to the conditions under which the host rocks 
were metamorphosed (e.g. Bradley et al., 2017). The 
exception of the Western Australian pegmatites examined in this work is the giant Greenbushes pegmatite swarm, which is interpreted to have intruded synchronous with regional deformation associated with the Donnybrook–Bridgetown 
shear zone under conditions of medium to high temperature 
and medium-pressure metamorphism (e.g. Partington et al., 
1995). Further details of the geological setting of each of 
the pegmatites examined in the current study are discussed 
in detail in the section Classification and geological 
assessment methodology.
Resource geology and deposit 
assessment implications
Overall:
•	While the deposits in Western Australia can be classified 
as LCT pegmatites, there is limited detail on mineralogy and deportment of lithium and other rare elements 
associated with many of the Western Australian 
deposits. 
•	Conventional X-ray based techniques do not have the ability to detect Li and other low atomic number elements (Be, B, C). Only with advanced analytical 
techniques coupled with mass spectrometry can the 
deportment of Li-minerals and its complexity with other associated minerals be evaluated (e.g. Aylmore et al., 2017; Aylmore et al., 2018a,b).
•	The documentation of the geochemistry of mineral 
constituents (e.g. rutile or feldspars) within pegmatites 
as an exploration tool is limited. Further work is required to identify mineral fractionation trends, which can aid in identifying Li and rare-metal minerals during the early stages of exploration.
In recent times, hand-held X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) devices (e.g. produced by Bruker, Hitachi and SciApps) have been produced which allow the geologist in the field to determine grade and some elemental associations in pegmatite 
deposits. However, these portable techniques are matrix 
dependent and need to be calibrated using laboratory-based analytical techniques (e.g. X-ray diffraction [XRD] analysis) before they can be used quantitatively. Process implications
Various processes have been developed and reported in the literature to recover Li from silicate  minerals and some 
approaches are dependent on the ore mineralogy (Brandt 
and Haus, 2010; Meshram, et al., 2014; Choubey, et al., 2016; 
Li et al., 2019). An outline of the conventional processing route for treatment of spodumene ores is illustrated in Figure 5.
Processing of hard-rock material requires physical 
beneficiation (grinding, sizing, flotation, gravity, reflux 
classifier and/or heavy media/magnetic separation) to liberate and concentrate the Li-bearing minerals and to remove gangue minerals, which are made up mainly of quartz, feldspars and micas. Processes involved in crushing 
and liberating Li-bearing minerals from gangue minerals 
have been reviewed and published by others (Gibson et al., 2017; Tadesse et al., 2019). 
Lithium is extracted from silicate concentrates usually 
by a combination of elevated temperature and chemical 
treatment processes (e.g. sulphation, carbonation or 
chlorination roasting). The treatment of spodumene concentrate conventionally involves a calcination step (~1100  °C) to convert the natural low-temperature, 
monoclinic α-spodumene into the tetragonal β-spodumene 
form, which is a more open crystalline structure where the Li ion can be more readily extracted through reaction with acid or alkali reagents (Ellestad and Leute, 1950; Salakjani et al., 2017; Aylmore et al., 2018b). The structural transformation 
of spodumene is illustrated in Figure 6.

GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western AustraliaThe thermal transformation of α-spodumene to β-spodumene 
has been studied in detail and involves different pathways. Formation of intermediate transformation phases has been 
attributed to the nature of the grain size, concentration of 
impurities and amorphous material formed in grinding as well as different heating rates and techniques (Peltosaari et al., 2015; Salakjani et al., 2016, 2017, 2019; Moore et al., 2018; 
Abdullah et al., 2019). 
Conventional roasting with chemical reagents has been 
used for treating micaceous minerals, such as lepidolite and zinnwaldite, prior to leaching the lithium into aqueous solutions. The sulphation process has been the most 
prominent leaching approach. Other processes such as 
chlorination requires corrosion-resistant plant equipment, although chlorination has the advantage of forming more highly soluble species (LiCl) than the carbonation and sulphation of minerals. 
Recovery of Li from pregnant liquors can be a challenge and 
is dependent upon the amount of other dissolved species (e.g. 
Na, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, F, Si, Al) that occur through the dissolution of silicate minerals.
Operations in Western Australia
In Western Australia, spodumene concentrates produced from Talison Lithium’s Greenbushes mine, Galaxy Resources’ Mt Cattlin mine, Mineral Resources’ Mt Marion mine and Pilbara 
Minerals’ Pilgangoora mines are currently shipped to Chinese 
converter plants for processing. Pilbara Minerals’ current 2  million tonne per annum (tpa) mining and processing operations produce ~330 000 tpa of ~6 wt% Li
2O spodumene 
concentrate. Pilbara Minerals has acquired the Ngungaju plant (formally Altura Lithium Operations) and is expecting these 
operations to increase production by ~180 000 to 200 000 
dry metric tonnes (dmt) by mid-2022, resulting in a combined production capacity of ~580  000  tpa. Mining operations at Wodinga and Bald Hill were shut down when the lithium price 
decreased but are expected to recommence production in 
the future.In 2017, Australian production of spodumene concentrate was 
worth $1 billion. With the expected rise in demand for lithium, 
the value of Australia concentrate production is predicted to increase to $10  billion by 2025. Globally, projected lithium demand is expected to exceed supply in about 2025 (Fig. 7).
A key issue for the Western Australian spodumene industry 
is that many of the existing beneficiation plants have 
struggled to meet design recovery rates. In order to meet converter specifications, spodumene miners often sacrifice recovery for grade, culminating in loss of spodumene to 
waste and poor overall resource utilization. It is estimated 
that $713  million worth of spodumene production is reporting to waste every year, mainly in the form of fines, which otherwise could potentially be recovered through improvements in processing technology (Harman, 2019). rapid heating

Wells et al.• The depor tment and management of deleterious 
elements such as F and Mn from mica can be 
problematic and important in considering process paths for treatment.
•
 L ithium products must meet a certain quality standard to 
be used in producing Li-batteries. The high-purity product 
yield of Li2CO3 and LiOH are in demand for battery 
production (Meshram et al., 2014; Choubey et al., 2016). 
Hence, knowledge of elemental impurities within the host Li-bearing minerals is important.
•
 Continued work is still r equired on developing novel, 
environmentally friendly processes to minimize harmful byproducts (e.g. HF and SO
2 gas emissions and energy 
for roasting process). Other process issues such as scaling (e.g. gypsum precipitation), water usage and 
minimization of power costs remain important.
To facilitate further process development, a comprehensive 
understanding of the deportment of Li and associated minerals in potential orebodies and linking the mineralogy to the fundamental processes of mineral liberation, thermal 
alteration and chemical dissolution is essential to allow the industry to predict the response of ore reserves to 
metallurgical treatment options.
Project objectives
The aim of this work was to develop a geometallurgical 
framework for Western Australian Li-pegmatite deposits 
that will lead to improved efficiencies in exploration, mineral 
beneficiation and processing techniques. 
The whole project was divided into three integrated 
modules of geology, mineralogy and metallurgy as outlined in Figure 8.
The Geology module  focused on assessing the geology 
of LCT pegmatites in Western Australia in terms of 
the formation, texture and deposition. Field studies to 
collect samples from mine sites and the acquisition 
of drillcore samples were carried out and targeted the main LCT pegmatites and regions in Western Australia. 
Minerals commonly found in pegmatites (e.g. feldspars, 
rutile, zircons, garnets and beryl muscovite) and their 
geochemistry signature were examined to identify pegmatite associations that can assist in targeting LCT 
pegmatites. Although granitic pegmatites are common 
and widespread, less than 0.1% are Li-enriched and can be considered as a legitimate eMaterial resource. In addition, 
work was carried out to produce a petrochronological 
and geochemical synthesis of LCT pegmatite mineral 
systems in Western Australia. The work looked to produce 
a classification scheme useful in both exploration targeting for economic LCT pegmatites and grade control in mining 
operations.
The Mineralogy module  focused on understanding 
the deportment of Li and other elements of interest in 
pegmatite deposits and improving the accuracy and 
precision of analytical techniques used to measure mineral components in pegmatites. Samples from mine sites taken 
from field studies and drillcore samples were examined as well as specimens from the Western Australian Boola 
Bardip museum. In 2017, the Li refinery global market was worth around 
$2 billion, and the refinery industry is expected to balloon in 
value to $65 billion by 2025 (Talbot and Watts, 2020). The 
first Li refinery in Australia run by a joint venture between IGO Ltd (49%) and Tianqi Lithium Corporation (51%) has 
been commissioned at Kwinana. The commissioned first 
train is expected to reach 24 000 tpa capacity by the end 
of 2022. A second production train is under construction 
and scheduled for commissioning in 2024 to enable a total 
of 48  000  tpa of battery grade lithium hydroxide. Further 
expansion to 96 000 tpa is expected in the following years. The Kwinana plant will produce lithium hydroxide from 
spodumene concentrate trucked from the Greenbushes 
mine. Early commissioning of the plant was stalled in 2020 
due to process engineering problems and the drop in lithium 
hydroxide price.
The approval by the Western Australia’s Environmental 
Protection Authority for construction and operation of Covalent Lithium’s 45  000  tpa lithium hydroxide 
refinery in Kwinana has been granted enabling the early 
commencement of construction works at the site, with production expected to start in the second half of 2024 
(www.australianmining.com.au/news/covalent-lithium-
begins-mt-holland-construction). 
Development of a processing plant by Liontown (Kathleen 
Valley) progressed through to the definitive feasibility study 
(DFS) in November 2021 with the final investment decision confirmed in June 2022. Production of battery grade lithium 
hydroxide is not expected until the second quarter of 2025 
(Liontown, 2022).
The processing of Li-rich micaceous deposits has yet to 
be developed on a commercial scale in Australia. These 
have previously been considered as uneconomic. For 
the treatment and extraction of lithium from Li–mica ores, sulphate roasting is best undertaken with CaSO
4 
and Ca(OH)2, followed by water leaching. In this process 
F present in the Li–mica is fixed by the formation of F-containing compounds to prevent HF formation. Other 
process options (e.g. halide based SiLeach process, L-Max 
Technology) have been developed that may allow treatment of more complex Li-feedstock and utilize the HF generated 
during acid leaching breakdown and recovery of lithium 
from mica. Lithium Australia has reported on testing of 
the Lepidolite Hill ore in Western Australia using their 
atmospheric halogen-based SiLeach process. 
Overall, the key impediments to the economic processing of 
Li-mineral ores are considered as follows:
•	It is important during the beneficiation stage that high-
grade Li concentrates are produced with little or no 
gangue material. Li-bearing minerals can be interlocked 
within gangue minerals requiring a finer grind to liberate. The thermal decomposition or dissolution of gangue 
material in the downstream process can reduce Li 
recovery.
•
 Existing technology for refining lithium is not suitable 
for treating the variability in some Li-bearing pegmatite 
ores. Mineral and elemental impurities (e.g. K, Na, Fe, Mn) 
associated with concentrates can lead to clinker formation and agglomeration of particles within the calcine 
convertor kilns, which leads to frequent shut-downs for maintenance and reduction in lithium recoveries.7
GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western AustraliaIn addition, the work assessed the accuracy and precision of 
novel, hand-held field portable analytical devices employing laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) techniques 
to measure Li concentrations in outcrop and hand samples. 
Emphasis was on assessment of the effectiveness of techniques and the correlations that can be made with the mineralogy of pegmatites.
From this work, assessment of the deportment of Li and 
other elements of interest and associated minerals in 
pegmatite deposits was obtained, and an independent assessment on the practical application of LIBS technology for exploration and mining operations was carried out.
For the Metallurgy module, the physical liberation 
characteristics of Li-bearing mineral particles and chemical 
processing behaviour of LCT pegmatites were correlated to the mineralogy data collated in the geology and mineralogy studies. Processing of hard-rock material is highly operating-expenditure intensive, involving beneficiation to liberate and 
concentrate the Li-bearing minerals and a combination of 
elevated temperature and chemical treatment processing (e.g. sulphation, carbonation or chlorination roasting) to recover Li from silicate minerals. Mineral liberation characteristics 
provide information about the required particle size to liberate 
and concentrate minerals of interest in the different pegmatite ores for grade control. A suite of samples representing different lithologies in the orebodies were examined. 
A study on the thermal decomposition of different pegmatite 
constituents under conventional calcination treatment 
conditions was undertaken to link the mineralogical 
properties to the metallurgical response of different pegmatite ores. Further studies examined the whole calcination and acid-bake process to correlate lithium 
extraction parameters to lithology. A comparison between pegmatite ore types and processing 
options that are either currently used or are reported as suitable for processing Western Australian pegmatite 
type ores were examined. A summary of the issues and 
impediments of processing Western Australian lithium ores, which identified factors that favour or limit full recoveries in different ore deposits, is provided.

Wells et al.Sample acquisition 
Sampling targeted the four main LCT pegmatite regions 
in Western Australia (Pilbara, Murchison, Goldfield and Southern regions) as outlined in Table 3.
Pegmatite material for analysis was sourced from either 
drillcore and/or from pit wall exposures at various deposits. The team worked with geological and metallurgical personnel on site to ensure representative samples were collected from the different regions. Sampling details of 
drillcore from the Greenbushes, Sinclair Caesium Deposit, 
Dome North, Kathleen Valley, Pilgangoora, Londonderry and Dalgaranga pegmatites are provided in Appendix 1.
Sampling of Greenbushes drillcore C3DD024 was 
undertaken at the GSWA Carlisle Core Library Facilities, 
whereas drillcore from the Sinclair, Londonderry and 
Dalgaranga pegmatites was sampled at the GSWA Joe Lord Core Library Kalgoorlie. Pit sampling from the Bald Hill (while still in operation) and Mt Cattlin pegmatite deposits was undertaken during a site visit in May 2019, whereas pit 
sampling at Greenbushes was undertaken during a site visit 
in August 2020. Samples were categorized and classified using the classifying scheme of Ċerný (1991). Industry and Curtin protocols for occupational health and safety were 
adhered to for fieldwork in remote locations and mine visits, 
classification and geology of LCT pegmatites in Western Australia.Classification and geology of LCT 
pegmatites in Western Australia
The geology of LCT pegmatites in Western Australia were assessed in terms of their formation, texture and deposition characteristics. The range of LCT pegmatites examined in 
the current study includes those that have been in operation 
for a prolonged period (e.g. Greenbushes for 120+ years and Mt Cattlin since mid-1900s), those that are now historical deposits (e.g. Dalgaranga/Mt Farmer and Londonderry), those 
that have only recently begun production (e.g. Pilgangoora), 
those that are now being evaluated as prospective (e.g. Dome North and Kathleen Valley), those that have, for economic reasons, recently been exhausted (e.g. Sinclair Caesium Deposit), and those that have recently been shut-
down or are under care and maintenance (e.g. Bald Hill). 
Consequently, there are limited publicly available, geological descriptions for some deposits (e.g. Dalgaranga and Bald Hill), while other deposits have been extensively investigated 
(e.g. Greenbushes). Hence, the following section provides a 
summary of the geological setting of each of the 10 pegmatite deposits, located in the Archean Yilgarn and Pilbara Cratons of Western Australia, examined in the current study. For reasons previously outlined, geological descriptions for some deposits 
will be less comprehensive compared to those deposits that 
have been more extensively investigated.
This section describes:
•	the methodology used for characterizing drillcore and 
representative examples of LCT pegmatites
•	the geological setting of the deposits examined in 
this work, which includes most of the significant (e.g. 
Greenbushes, Kathleen Valley and Pilgangoora) LCT pegmatites in Western Australia
•	the mineralogy and textures of the samples collected.

GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western Australia•	Preliminary bulk chemical and mineralogical analyses  
– a full elemental suite analyses (Appendix 2) and 
quantitative X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) analyses 
(Appendix 3) was carried out to characterize sub-samples 
of pegmatite from all sites.
•	Mineralogy and textural evaluation  – polished sections or 
thin sections of suitable rock specimens were produced at the John de Laeter Centre (JdLC), Curtin University.  
The identification of tourmaline, garnet, Ta–Nb-oxide, beryl and other minerals associated with fractionated pegmatites was carried out within the mineralogy module.
•	A combination of optical and electron microscopy  
instruments at the JdLC were utilized, including the: 
o Tescan Integrated Mineral Analyser (TIMA)  which 
uses a scanning electron microscopy – energy 
dispersive X-ray system (SEM–EDS) to generate mineral maps and characterize textural features and mineral associations. Detailed TIMA mineral mapping 
of all pegmatite drillcore and pit samples is provided 
in Appendix 4.
o focused ion beam-scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM) which uses a time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) to produce light element (Li and B) maps.
•	Geochemical signature of pegmatites  – minerals 
commonly found in pegmatites and their geochemical 
signatures were examined to assist in targeting LCT pegmatites. Major element compositions were determined using electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) measurements of an 11-element suite (Si, Al, Fe, Mn, 
K, Ca, Mg, Na, F, Rb, Cs) at the Centre for Microscopy, 
Characterisation and Analysis (CMCA), University of Western Australia. The trace geochemical analysis of a 40-element suite of selected mineral grains was then 
quantified by laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma–
mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) at the JdLC for both geochronology and the assessment of the degree of fractionation of pegmatites in this study. In particular, the following investigations were undertaken to determine 
whether it is possible that geochemical trends can 
be used to determine the degree of fractionational crystallization experienced by the pegmatite which might be applied as a ‘fertility’ or ‘prospectively’ indicator:o The K:Rb and K:Cs ratios of pegmatitic mica.
o Lithium, K, Rb, Cs, and Ta in muscovite.
o Elemental composition of Ta–Nb-oxide minerals.
•	Dating techniques – several geochronological techniques were applied to place temporal constraints regarding the timing of emplacement or crystallization 
of the host pegmatite:
o Zircon U–Pb geochronology using JdLC GeoHistory 
Facility (LA-ICP-MS)
o Spodumene and muscovite Ar–Ar geochronology using the 
40Ar/39Ar geochronological technique using 
the JdLC Western Australian Argon Isotope Facility.
•	Lithium isotope analysis  – the isotopic homogeneity 
of selected spodumene crystals was determined to 
assess if a Li-isotope standard could be developed that 
may have application as a provenance indicator of the material source of mined spodumene ore concentrates:
o 6Li/7Li analysis was undertaken using the JdLC 
GeoHistory Facility (LA-ICP-MS).
Details of all analytical procedures are outlined in Appendix 3.
Testing of field portable analytical devices 
Application of a field portable analytical device for quantitative compositional analysis was tested using LIBS of well-characterized, pressed-powder discs of pulped samples 
with known composition. Details of the technique is given in

Wells et al.Geological setting of LCT pegmatite of 
the southern region
Pegmatites hosted in the southern region of Western 
Australia, along the southwestern margin of the Yilgarn Craton, included in this study were from the Greenbushes and 
Mt Cattlin Deposits.
Greenbushes
Setting
The Greenbushes pegmatite swarm is located approximately 
350 km south of Perth, and about 80 km southeast of Bunbury (Fig. 3), occurring within the Archean South West Terrane 
(Partington et al., 1995; Quentin de Gromard et al., 2021). 
Mining for Sn began in 1888 and has since been in continuous production, making Greenbushes the longest operating mine in Western Australia (Partington et al., 1995). Jacobson et 
al. (2007) provide a detailed account of the mining history 
of the deposit. Work by Partington et al. (1995) provide a detailed account of the geological setting of the Greenbushes pegmatite, which is summarized here.
The pegmatite swarm at Greenbushes consists of north-
trending pegmatites, the largest trending north-northwest 
for up to 2500 m, emplaced into dioritic gneiss, amphibolite, 
granofels, ultramafic schist and banded iron formation of the Archean South West Terrane greenstones (Quentin de Gromard et al., 2021), informally referred to as the ‘Balingup 
metamorphic belt’ (Wilde, 1996; Fig. 10). The pegmatite 
swarm intruded close to, and parallel with, the north to north-northeasterly trending Donnybrook–Bridgetown shear zone (Partington et al., 1995; Fetherston, 2004; Partington, 2017). The Donnybrook–Bridgetown shear zone is a 150-km long 
regional lineament that trends northerly, subparallel to the 
Darling Fault in the north of the Balingup metamorphic belt and northwest–southeast oblique to the Darling Fault in the south (Partington et al., 1995). U–Pb zircon age of 2641 ± 
4 Ma, undertaken in the present study of grains, interpreted 
to be inherited in origin (refer to the section (U–Pb) dating), updates the earlier U–Pb zircon age of 2527 ± 2 Ma of the Greenbushes pegmatite as reported by Partington et al. (1995) and Kendall-Langley et al. (2020). While our findings reduce 
the age disparity between the older Greenbushes pegmatite 
and the younger Logue Brook granite at 2612 ± 5  Ma (Fetherston, 2004), the age difference may dispel previous proposals for a genetic link between the Logue Brook granite 
and the Greenbushes pegmatite (Partington et al., 1995).
Emplacement and crystallization of the Greenbushes 
pegmatite is considered pre- or near synchronous with 
regional deformation within the Donnybrook–Bridgetown shear zone as evidenced by heterogeneous deformation, recrystallization and mylonitization of parts of the pegmatite 
(Partington et al., 1995; Fetherston, 2004). Despite the fine-
grained and sheared nature of the pegmatite, four layered, major mineralogical zones are identified (Fig. 10) consisting of a contact zone (mainly albite–quartz), a K-feldspar zone 
(microcline–quartz), a Na-feldspar zone (albite–quartz) 
containing the main Ta mineralization, and a Li-zone (spodumene–quartz) as the main source of Li mineralization (Partington et al., 1995; Fetherston, 2004; Partington, 2017). Ta-bearing ore consists of tantalite, tantalite-enriched 
cassiterite, stibiotantalite and minor Ta minerals (e.g. 
wodginite, tapiolite and microlite).The highly evolved or fractionated nature of the layered pegmatite units has resulted in the development of discrete Ta–Sn and Li-rich spodumene lodes. This is evident at 
Greenbushes with major Sn–Ta mineralization occurring in 
the Cornwall and Hanging Walls lodes mined in the Cornwall pit, and Li mineralization (spodumene) occurring mainly in the Lithium pit (C3 pit) (Fetherston, 2004). The Central or C1 pit has discrete occurrences of both mineralization 
types (Fetherston, 2004). The C3 pit contains the main Li 
deposit, occurring in the upper part of a 250-m wide Li-enriched pegmatite. The pegmatite ore zone comprises a quartz–spodumene body up to 100 m wide and 600 m long, 
dipping at 30–80° west to southwest (Porter Geo, 2019: www.
portergeo.com.au/database/mineinfo.asp?mineid=mn508, viewed 13-06-2021). Lithium mineralization within the C1 pit is hosted by an approximately 500-m long by 150-m wide ore zone in the pegmatite (Porter Geo, 2019). A third pit, C2, is 
situated between C3 and C1 but only limited mining has been 
undertaken and is currently not in production.
Sampling and characterization
Greenbushes samples for this study included drillcore 
materials obtained from the GSWA Carlisle core library 
(C3DD024) and during a visit to site in August 2020. The 
location of the drillcore and pit samples are shown in Figure 
11. For drillhole C3DD024, downhole logging records show changes in bulk rock; weight percent Li
2O and Na2O contents 
and hyper-spectral data were used to aid the selection of core intervals for mineralogical and geochemical investigation 
(Fig. 12). A montage of TIMA mineral mapping results 
referenced to the compositional downhole logging is useful in characterizing the mineralogical and textural evolution of the Greenbushes pegmatite. The Li-zone, approximately 120  m 
thick (0–120  m), consists mainly of spodumene–quartz 
mineralization, with spodumene occurring as both tabular laths 3–4  cm in length and as smaller poikiloblastic blebs (Fig. 12). Minor albite occurs sporadically in the Li-zone and lepidolite is present as an additional, late-stage Li-bearing 
phase (e.g. #241170), as evidenced by crosscutting textures 
with spodumene (Appendix 4).
At depths >120  m, the Li-zone grades sharply into the Na-
zone that continues to end of hole (EOH), associated with the more common occurrence of albite (Fig. 12). This zone is also 
marked by the variable occurrence of K-feldspar as supported 
by a variable K
2O content of approximately 4–6 wt% (Fig. 12). 
TIMA mineral mapping highlights a distinct textural change within the Na-zone as evidenced by a decrease in spodumene 
crystal size to 1-cm long laths at the top of the Na-zone to 
granular, ‘ovoid’ 1-mm sized spodumene grains that form raft-like aggregates or show deformation in the form of grain elongation and grain wrapping (e.g. #241174 and #241175; 
Appendix 3). This imparts a distinct foliation, with segregation 
of apatite, in the Na-zone towards the base of the hole (Fig. 12). These mylonitic-like textures are consistent with and support the heterogenous deformation and recrystallization of the pegmatite synchronous with the regional deformation 
and metamorphic events within the Donnybrook–Bridgetown 
shear zone (Partington et al., 1995; Fetherston, 2004).
Pit sampling at Greenbushes was restricted to the C3 
(Lithium pit) and C1 (Central lode) openpits (Fig. 11); access to the Cornwall pit farther to the north was not possible. 
Anecdotally, mine geologists note a difference in spodumene 
crystal size, with spodumene crystals in the C1 pit generally larger than spodumene in the C3 pit (Husein Al Shakarji, 11
GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western Australiawritten com., August 2020). Representative examples of bulk 
material collected from the C3 and C1 pits are shown in Figure 13, with a detailed description of the pit samples provided in 
Appendix 1.
TIMA mineral mapping results, as detailed in Appendix 4, 
confirmed the dominant quartz–spodumene mineralogy of the C3-300 series and C1-100 series samples (Fig. 13). These are representative of high-grade, Li-zone pegmatite 
that display a similarly dominant spodumene–quartz 
textural intergrowth as mapped for Li-zone samples in C3DD024 drillcore (Appendix 4; Fig. 12 in TIMA mineral maps for selected samples). The similar foliated texture of the low-grade, Na-zone, albite–pegmatite example, C3-100, is 
texturally comparable to the inferred zone of mylonization in 
drillcore C3DD024 as exemplified by sample #241175 (e.g. Appendix 4) and supports localized re-crystallization and pegmatite deformation in the C3 pit.
A feature of the C1, high-grade, Na- and Li-zone samples 
is the occurrence of megacrystic (+10-cm sized), tabular 
spodumene as white, pale-grey and pink crystals (Fig. 13). The poikiloblastic nature (i.e. symplectic texture) and smaller size of spodumene in samples collected from the C3 pit suggests 
the relatively rapid and synchronous crystallization of 
spodumene and quartz (Fig. 13). The similarity of the graphic spodumene–quartz texture mapped in samples collected from the high-grade zone in the C3 pit to that mapped in the upper part of drillcore C3DD024 (Fig. 12) is discussed further in section, Pegmatite mineral fractionation. In contrast, the tabular nature of spodumene at C1 indicates that spodumene 
formed first prior to final cooling of the pegmatite.
Mt Cattlin
Setting
The Mt Cattlin pegmatite, also known as the Cattlin Creek 
pegmatite, is situated about 2 km north of Ravensthorpe and 400 km southeast of Perth (Fig. 3). The deposit occurs at the 
southeast margin of the Yilgarn Craton within the Southern 
Cross Domain of the Youanmi Terrane (Blewett et al., 2010; see Fig. 14).
The pegmatite at Mt Cattlin is a spodumene-rich, Ta-bearing 
body, hosted by the Ravensthorpe quartz diorite and 
greenstone belt (Fig. 14), where the granitic rocks are dated 
at about 3.0  –  2.95  Ga (Myers, 1993). The Ravensthorpe greenstone belt is restricted to the north-closing, south-plunging Beulah synform (Witt, 1999; Porter, 2017). The 
eastern and western limbs of the Beulah synform define 
the Carlingup and Cocanarup domains, respectively (Porter, 2017). Both are composed of quartzo–feldspathic gneiss, schist, iron formation of metasedimentary origin and 2.96 Ga felsic and ultramafic volcanic rocks (Porter, 2017).

GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western AustraliaThe main mineralized body occurs as a 1–20-m thick, 
shallow-dipping to flat-lying pegmatite dyke (Area =  
1 x 1.5 km; Fig. 14) near the Beulah synform axis. Multiple,  
flat-lying Li–Ta pegmatites occur below the main pegmatite (Porter, 2017). Tantalum mineralization is mainly confined to a high-grade zone of Ta-rich lenses and pods  
(Fetherston, 2004).
All dykes are hosted by the Archean Annabelle Volcanics, 
a sequence of metamorphosed ultramafic, mafic and 
felsic rocks (Porter, 2017), with dating of rhyolite in the Annabelle Volcanics at 2989 ± 11 Ma (Witt, 1999). To the east, another swarm of north-trending pegmatites intrude 
both the Annabelle Volcanics and the adjoining Archean, calc–alkaline Manyutup Tonalite (Fetherston, 2004).  
At Kundip, approximately 18  km southwest of 
Ravensthorpe, coarse-grained tonalite was dated at 2965 
± 12  Ma (U–Pb zircon) (Witt, 1999). In the same area, a 
tonalite porphyry dyke was dated at 2989 ± 7 Ma (zircon U–Pb) identical to the reported age of the Annabelle Volcanics (Witt, 1999). The Ravensthorpe pegmatite swarm may 
be related to a late-phase, Archean (Sapkota and Wyche, 
2022) granite (quartz-monzonite) located about 7 km to the northeast (Fetherston, 2004).

GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western Australianorthwest (e.g. Stage 1F) and to the southeast (2SE Stage 
1) as denoted by Galaxy Resources (e.g. Fig. 14; Urgine, 2016). These authors describe important mineralogical 
and textural differences between the Western and Eastern 
Pegmatite Sheets. Primary spodumene mineralization in the Western Pegmatite Sheet is hosted by two zones that comprise nearly 75% by volume of the deposit, with an 
extremely coarse-grained (megacrystic) spodumene zone 
that comprises about 80% of mineralization overlying a medium-coarse grained spodumene zone (Urgine, 2016). In both units, green spodumene (i.e. partially altered) predominates over white–grey (i.e. unaltered) spodumene. 
Spodumene alteration is largely restricted to the western 
edge of the sheet, where the pegmatite sheet abruptly terminates against a north-northwesterly trending fault (Urgine, 2016).
Though uncommon to rare in the Mt Cattlin pegmatite 
types examined in the present study, the main Ta-bearing 
phases identified were columbite–tantalite (e.g. MC750 and MC1900) and microlite (e.g. MC1600_B1/B4) (Appendix 3). In addition, a single, large (500 µm), complex, Nb-depleted, Ta–(U?)-oxide phase was mapped in MC1500 (Appendix 
4). A conspicuous feature of the main albite–spodumene 
pegmatite is the extensive alteration of spodumene, which 
is described in more detail in section, Spodumene–cookeite 
alteration.
The megacrystic spodumene–albite pegmatite is laterally 
extensive and is the main pegmatite type occurring in 
the Eastern Pegmatite Sheet (Urgine, 2016). Spodumene alteration is less well developed with about 60% white to pale-grey spodumene and 40% green spodumene. In 
addition, Urgine (2016) describes locally variable lepidolite 
mineralization, which is more important in the central eastern pegmatite sheet (e.g. Stage 1F), and a locally developed K-feldspar zone that occurs mainly in the Western Pegmatite Sheet. This contrasts to the occurrence 
of a coarsely crystalline, basement albitic zone, which is 
more uniformly developed across both pegmatite sheets (Urgine, 2016).
Sampling and characterization
Sampling at Mt Cattlin was mainly from two central pit locations as shown in Figure 15. Additional samples were also collected from the Dowling pit to the west and from 
the ROM pad (Appendix 1). Samples from the ROM pad 
consisted mainly of fragments of tabular, pale-grey and green spodumene megacrysts (+20 cm long) (Appendix 1). Pegmatite material collected across the Mt Cattlin Deposit 
hosts spodumene as fragments of acicular, or more 
typically lath-like, megacrysts, with pegmatite material collected from the Dowling pit and the SE pit (2SE Stage 1) representative of the megacrystic, spodumene–albite pegmatite zone (Fig. 16). Pegmatite collected from the 
Stage 1F pit is also representative of the spodumene–albite 
pegmatite with locally developed lepidolite mineralization (Fig. 16).
Megacrystic spodumene exhibits marked differences in 
colour and various alteration textures (Fig. 16). Unaltered 
spodumene is generally pale-grey, whereas partially altered 
spodumene is green–grey and may display a darker green alteration rim along crystal margins (Fig. 16). As pseudo-morphic alteration progresses to completion, spodumene displays a massive dull, green–black or waxy-mottled appearance (Fig. 16). Unaltered or partially altered spodumene is mainly hosted by a highly fractured, pale-blue albite–quartz matrix (with minor Li-mica/muscovite and accessory tourmaline) compared to the massive, 
milky white (secondary?) albite matrix where spodumene 
alteration has gone to completion (Fig. 16).
Such alteration is consistent with previous descriptions 
of altered pegmatite mineralogy at Mt Cattlin, where Grigson (2011) and Urgine (2016) described the alteration 
mineralogy as (secondary) finely crystalline muscovite. 
Less commonly, spodumene may be replaced by finely crystalline lepidolite, evidenced as pink spodumene (e.g. Grigson, 2011); examples of such altered spodumene were not collected in the present study.
However, TIMA mineral mapping of examples  
of megacrystic spodumene–albite pegmatite (e.g. Appendix 4) demonstrate that spodumene alteration is mineralogically complex (Appendix 4; Fig. 16), where replacement is predominantly a fine-grained mixture 
of secondary micaeous phases (e.g. MC1200; Fig. 16). 
In comparison, where spodumene replacement is near completion, pseudo-morphic alteration by intimately associated, secondary albite+lepidolite/polylithionite (e.g. 
as for MC1600, Appendix 4) or by patchy albite–quartz–
lepidolite/polylithionite replacement, which produces the distinctive waxy-mottled texture, may occur (e.g. MC1900; Fig. 16). Element distribution mapping clearly shows that alteration is associated with coincidentally elevated K and 
Mg contents (Appendix 4). A more detailed discussion 
of spodumene alteration, across all LCT pegmatites investigated in the current study, is provided in section, Spodumene morphology and alteration: indicators of 
pegmatite crystallization evolution.
LCT pegmatites of the goldfields
Due to the proximity of several rare-element pegmatites to 
the major regional centre of Kalgoorlie–Boulder and their occurrence in the eastern Yilgarn, the regional geology 
and location of the Sinclair Caesium, Dome North, Bald 
Hill, Mt Marion and Londonderry pegmatites are shown together in Figure 17. The Sinclair Caesium, Dome North, Mt Marion, Londonderry and Lepidolite Hill pegmatites 
occur within the Coolgardie Domain of the Norseman–
Wiluna greenstone belt in the Kalgoorlie Terrane (Fig. 17). The Bald Hill pegmatite occurs near the western margin of the Kurnalpi Terrane in proximity to the Ockerburry Fault hosted within the Belches Basin (Fig. 17). Kathleen Valley 
occurs to the north and along the western margin of the 
Kalgoorlie Terrane, within the Yakabindie Domain of the Norseman–Wiluna greenstone belt, in proximity to the Ida Fault (Fig. 17).
The Goldfields LCT pegmatites occur within the central-
western portion of the Eastern Goldfields Superterrane 
(EGST), which comprises the Kalgoorlie, Gindalbie and Kurnalpi Terranes (Fig. 17), and the Burtville and Yamarna Terranes to the east (Cassidy et al., 2006; Witt 
et al., 2020). The EGST is highlighted by the Sm–Nd 
isotope model age map, where the Ida Fault separates the older crustal domain in the west from the younger crustal domains in the east (Champion and Huston, 2016; Witt et al., 2020). The Kalgoorlie Terrane forms 
a north-northwesterly to south-southeasterly trending 16

GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western Australiastrip varying in width from 50 to 120  km and a length 
of ~800 km. Representing the westernmost structural 
element of the Eastern Goldfields Superterrane, the Kalgoorlie Terrane abuts the Youanmi Terrane across the east-dipping Ida Fault and is adjacent to the Kurnalpi 
Terrane across the east-dipping Ockerburry Fault (Fig. 
17). The Kalgoorlie Terrane is interpreted as a basinal 
formation initiated by a rifting event at ~2810 Ma into 
which the younger sequences of the terrane were deposited (e.g. Wyche and Wyche, 2017; PorterGeo 
Database, 2019).
The Kurnalpi Terrane is considered to have formed as 
part of the same rift complex as the Kalgoorlie Terrane 
but with a different suite of supracrustal formations, 
related to calc-alkaline volcanism (e.g. Witt et al., 2020). 
Exposed over a strike length of 650  km and varying in 
width from ~50 to 150  km, the Kurnalpi Terrane abuts 
the older Burtville Terrane to the east and its eastern 
margin is interpreted to define the eastern extent of the 
Kalgoorlie–Kurnalpi rift (Witt et al., 2020). The similarity 
of crystallization ages and Nd signatures of the oldest 
rocks in the Kalgoorlie and Kurnalpi Terranes to granites 
and greenstones of the Youanmi Terrane is interpreted to indicate that attenuated crust of the Youanmi Terrane 
forms the basement to supracrustal rocks of the 
Kalgoorlie and Kurnalpi Terranes (Czarnota et al., 2010).
Sinclair Caesium Deposit
Setting
The history and geology of the Sinclair Caesium Deposit is described in detail by Crook et al. (2019). The deposit is 
situated 125 km south-southeast of Kalgoorlie or 35 km 
north-northwest of Norseman, within the Coolgardie 
Domain of the Norseman–Wiluna greenstone belt. The southern extent of the Coolgardie Domain is marked by the occurrence of two granitoid bodies, the 2690–
2664 Ma Pioneer Monzogranite (formerly referred to as 
the Pioneer Dome) and the 2687 Ma Burra Monzogranite 
(formerly referred to as the Widgiemooltha Dome) (Hall, 
2022a). The east–west trending Proterozoic Binneringie 
Dyke (c.  1258 Ma) transects the sequence between 
the Pioneer and Burra Monzogranites. The Pioneer 
Monzogranite is inferred to be younger than the Burra Monzogranite as the porphyritic Pioneer Monzogranite 
Monzogranite lacks the foliation evident in the Burra 
Monzogranite (Griffin, 1989). The Pioneer Dome core 
intrudes the 2664 ± 5 Ma Fifty Mile Tank Gneiss (Nelson, 
1997), Archean and a younger sedimentary sequence 
(Crook et al., 2019).
Pegmatites have preferentially intruded the Kalgoorlie 
Group greenstone sequence along a 20-km long strike 
length, faulted on the eastern margin of the Pioneer Dome 
(Fig. 18). With at least 13 pegmatite clusters identified, including LCT-types, the pegmatite dykes form a narrow 
(<1  km wide) north–south trending corridor along the 
eastern flank of the Pioneer Dome (Crook et al., 2019). 
Evidence for several episodes of pegmatite intrusion is 
shown by less deformed pegmatites crosscutting more deformed pegmatites (Crook et al., 2019).
The pegmatites are zoned mineralogically with cores 
containing quartz, microcline, Li–micas lepidolite and zinnwaldite, and petalite and pollucite and contact zones 
limited to quartz, K/Na-feldspar and muscovite (Fig. 18; Crook et al., 2019). Massive mono-mineralic lenses of pollucite ranging from 2 to 10 m in length typically occur adjacent to quartz and are nearly always rimmed by  
Cs-bearing clays. Lithium mineralization also occurs in the 
pegmatite cores, hosted by massive lepidolite, petalite, 
eucryptite, zinnwaldite and rarer amblygonite (Crook et al., 
2019).
Discovered in 2016, the Sinclair Caesium Deposit at the 
time represented only the third known, commercially viable source of Cs along with the Tanco Mine in Manitoba, 
Canada and the Bikita Mine, Zimbabwe (Crook et al., 
2019). Now exhausted, Essential Metals (formally own by 
Pioneer Resources) are exploring the potential for further 
Cs mineralization in the area.
Sampling and characterization
As access to the Sinclair Caesium Deposit was not possible, a request was submitted (November 2020) to 
view drillcores PDD162, PDD174 and PDD179 at the Joe 
Lord Core library facilities, Kalgoorlie. The location of hole 
PDD162 is shown in Figure 18 and intersects the main Cs mineralization. The associated lithological logging 
(121412_135034_M63_665_WADL4_Lithology) and 
assay (121412_13509_M63_665_WADL4_XRD) reports, 
initially prepared by Pioneer Resources Ltd., were used 
to aid drillcore sampling to target selected intervals of 
interest for follow-up study. Drillcore imagery from recent 
HyLogging line scans (completed in May 2020) for holes 
PDD162 PDD174 and PDD179 are presented in Figures 
19, 21 and 23, respectively, with core intervals selected for 
analysis also shown (Figs 20, 22, 23). A brief description 
of the core intervals selected for sampling from PDD162, 
PDD174 and PDD179 is listed in Appendix 1.
Holes PDD162 and PDD174 intersect Cs mineralization as 
shown in depth plots of the Cs-assay data for both holes (Figs 19, 21), whereas PDD179 intersected the pegmatite 
wall zone (Fig. 23). It must be noted that for PDD162 
and PDD174 prior sampling for assay analysis did not 
leave sufficient core to enable material for other analysis, particularly for PPD162, where only ¼-core remained. 
Hence, sampling of the Cs-mineralized zone in PDD162 
was not possible. In addition, with few exceptions, for those 
core intervals that were selected across all three holes, only 25-mm diameter, polished rounds were prepared for study 
(e.g. refer to Appendix 4).
The pegmatite sequence intersected by PDD162 and 
PDD174 are representative of the complete pegmatite mineral zonation as described in the cross-section of the Sinclair pegmatite (Crook et al., 2019). In PDD162, 
fractured, blocky, perthitic microcline occurs over the  
0 – 37.55-m depth interval, hosting two prominent 
muscovite bands, as an upper thinner band (0.55 m thick) and a deeper, nearly 2-m thick band (e.g. sample #3;  
Figs 19, 20; Appendix 4). This overlies and grades sharply to an 11-m thick zone of high-grade pollucite (Fig. 19; Appendix 1). Zones of pollucite–amblygonite–albite interspersed within the pollucite zone account for the varied Cs
2O content in the mineralized zone (Fig. 19). 
The pollucite zone transitions sharply to the underlying, 
approximately 12-m thick (from 49.35 to 63 m) lepidolite-bearing zone, as an albite–lepidolite–quartz pegmatite type  20

Wells et al.(e.g. samples #9 and #10; Appendix 4) with lepidolite-free, 
quartz–albite zones hosting blocky muscovite books  
(e.g. sample #12; Fig. 19; Appendix 4).
The same mineralized sequence is intersected by PDD174 
(Appendix 1) but the mineralized Cs-zone is hosted above 
and below by lepidolite-bearing zones, which in turn host  
Li mineralization as petalite, with the hanging wall lepidolite–petalite units comparatively thinner than the 
footwall units (Appendix 1).
The sequence intersected by PDD179 consists of the 
lower portion of an upper weathered ultramafic unit and an unaltered, 12-m thick, highly foliated footwall greenstone (metasediment – refer to slide #14; Appendix 4) hosting 
an approximately 43-m thick pegmatite unit (Appendix 
1). Metasedimentary rocks are strongly foliated with amphibole, albite, biotite, zinnwaldite and minor sulphides (Appendix 4). The pegmatite consists of a highly fractured and mixed albite–quartz–microcline wall zone with variable 
muscovite that can be coarsely crystalline (e.g. sample 
#5; Fig. 23). The mixed wall zone continues below the greenstone unit (Appendix 1).
Semi-quantitative EDS analysis of the mica (muscovite, 
lepidolite and zinnwaldite) composition (F, Cs, Mn and Fe 
contents) in TIMA mineral maps of the Sinclair pegmatite 
(Appendix 4) are summarized in Table 4. Although the trace element compositions are similar, there are some important differences. Muscovite contains a moderate F content (2–3  wt%), comparable to zinnwaldite (3.3  wt%), whereas lepidolite/polylithionite has a tendency to contain the 
highest F content of about 6 wt% (Table 4). The Fe content 
in muscovite and lepidolite/polylithionite was variably low to moderate, in contrast to the very high Fe content of zinnwaldite at about 13 wt% (Table 4). Caesium was not detected in muscovite, whereas all other micas showed 
consistently low contents in the range 0.4 – 0.7 wt% (Table 
4). The significance of the observed distribution of Cs and how it relates to the mineral evolution at Sinclair is discussed in more detail in the section Caesium mineralization.

Wells et al.Dome North
Setting
The Dome North Lithium Project is situated approximately 
48  km north-northwest of Norseman in the Coolgardie Domain of the Norseman–Wiluna greenstone belt (Figs 
17, 18). Discovered in June 2019 by Essential Metals, 
the Dome North Lithium Project represents one of the newest pegmatite discoveries in Western Australia, with a current defined mineral resource of 11.2 Mt @ 1.21% Li
2O 
(Essential Metals, 2021).
Felsic–metasedimentary rocks of the 2692–2655  Ma 
Black Flag Group (Hall et al., 2022a), interfingered 
with greenstone units of the 2706 ± 36 Ma Kambalda 
Kommatiite (Foster et al., 1996), wrap around the northern margin of the Pioneer Monzogranite (Fig. 18), and define a regional, deformation fabric (Fig. 24). Multiple north-
northeasterly trending faults are inferred in the northern 
host rocks, and this observation is consistent with a dominant north-northeasterly oriented fabric recorded in metasedimentary and greenstone units exposed along the eastern margin of the granitoid (Griffin, 1989).
The Dome North Lithium Project currently comprises three, 
subparallel, north-northwesterly striking, rare-element 
pegmatites located ~2  km north of the northern margin of the Pioneer Monzogranite (Fig. 24). The westernmost Heller pegmatite and the central Davy pegmatite, hosted 
by greenstone units of the Kalgoorlie Group, crosscut the 
regional fabric (Fig. 24). The largest, eastern Cade Deposit has intruded, en echelon style, subparallel to the regional fabric developed in the Black Flag group (Fig. 24; Jessica Booth, Essential Metals geologist, written com, December 
2020). The north-northwesterly trending, steeply dipping 
(near vertical) Cade pegmatite has a strike length of 860 m and is up to 20 m in width (Fig. 25).
Sampling and characterization
Core sections from two drillholes were kindly provided by Essential Metals for inclusion in the present study. Holes PDRCD318 and PDRCD319 were drilled at the 
north-northeast extent of the main Cade pegmatite 
body with collars at local grid references X = 367588m, Y = 6486236m (#318) and X = 367966m, Y = 6486236m (#319). The holes are declined to the west and intersect 
the approximately 20-m thick pegmatite at relative levels 
of 220 m (#318) and 160 m (#319), approximately 60 m apart (Fig. 26).
Drillcore for each of the pegmatite sections intersected by 
PDRCD318 and PDRCD319 are shown in Figures 27 and 28, respectively, with sampling locations of core intervals 
examined also shown; an accompanying core description 
for each interval is provided in Appendix 1.
Hanging wall metasedimentary rocks (within 10 m of the 
pegmatite contact) in PDRCD318 are weakly foliated and mainly comprise quartz–biotite–albite(cleavelandite)–
siderophyllite with minor almandine garnet and pyrrhotite 
detected by TIMA mineral mapping (Appendix 4). Footwall metasediments in PDRCD319 are more strongly foliated, with the foliation defined by intimately associated lobate 
and elongate grains of quartz and pyrrhotite, 200 x 
1000 µm (e.g. Appendix 4).The pegmatite intersection within PDRCD318 contains a 
1-m thick petalite-rich zone consisting of massive petalite 
that grades into a predominantly muscovite–quartz–albite pegmatite, with subparallel bands of muscovite and coarsely crystalline (3–4  cm) green tourmaline (Appendix 1; Appendix 4). Textural evidence in the form 
of poikiloblastic intergrowths of quartz–spodumene–
petalite provide an example of the formation of symplectic SQI (spodumene–quartz intergrowth, e.g. Bradley et al., 2017) where the intrusion crystallized along the 
spodumene–petalite-phase equilibrium line (Fig. 28). 
This is discussed in more detail in the section Pegmatite mineral fractionation.
For the Cade pegmatite intersected at depth by 
PDRCD319, the hanging wall contact zone consists of an equigranular spodumene-free quartz–muscovite, with 
subhedral, 1–2 mm sized, fractured garnet (almandine–
spessartine) as the main accessory phase (Appendix 4). This grades into the main pegmatite body consisting of a quasi-homogeneous, quartz–spodumene–albite 
mineralogy with rare muscovite (Appendix 4.). Subparallel 
alignment of acicular, white spodumene imparts a conspicuous lineation as evident in the drillcore imagery (Fig. 29); in cross-section spodumene displays a mottled texture (Appendix 4). Albite is present as randomly 
distributed, uncommon blocky laths ranging from 2 to 
5 cm in size (Appendix 1; Appendix 4).
Spodumene displays a distinct change in size in relation 
to proximity to the hanging wall and footwall contacts compared to the centre of the pegmatite body. Below the 
hanging wall contact zone, spodumene occurs as acicular 
crystals 3 x 0.5 cm in size, increasing to 5 x 0.5 cm in the central portion of the Cade pegmatite (e.g. sample #15; Appendix 3). Proximal to the footwall contact, spodumene 
again decreases in size (e.g. 2.5 x 0.5 cm; sample #19) 
becoming more lath-like, occurring as rare, stunted laths approximately 5–6 mm long at the top of the wall zone (e.g. sample #20; Appendix 1; Appendix 4).27

Bald Hill was commissioned in March 2018 with initial 
production of 155  000  tpa of spodumene concentrate. 
In early 2019, Bald Hill was reported to contain a total 
Li resource of 26.5 Mt at 1.0 wt% Li2O and Ta resource 
of 4.4  Mt at 336  ppm Ta2O5 at a combined cut-off of 
0.3 wt% Li2O and 149 ppm Ta2O5, respectively (Source: www.
allianceminerals.com.au/projects/, viewed 21–02–2019). In July 2019, Alliance Minerals changed its name to Alita 
Resources. However, Bald Hill was placed under care and 
maintenance in August 2019.
Sampling and characterization
Sampling at Bald Hill was from the northern section of the main pit, with bulk material collected from low-grade (samples denoted as BH2 series) and high-grade zones 
(samples denoted as BH1 series), the locations of which 
are shown in Figures 30 and 31. Representative examples of low-grade pegmatite are shown in Figure 32. Randomly oriented, prismatic, lath-like spodumene megacrysts 
(+10–15 cm in length), as fragments of larger crystals, are Bald Hill
Setting
The Bald Hill Deposit is located about 50  km southeast 
of Kambalda within the Kurnalpi Terrane of the Eastern Goldfields (see Fig. 17). The Ta-rich pegmatite is typically 
1–8  m thick in the vicinity of the mine and varies from 
horizontal to gently west-dipping to a depth of about 30 m (Fetherston, 2004).
The main pegmatite unit strikes north–south and is 
surrounded by several, smaller subparallel pegmatites with 
a total strike length of 1245  m and width of 990  m with 
an overall depth interval of ~195 m (Tawana Resources NL and Alliance Mineral Assets Ltd, 2018). The Bald Hill pegmatites intrude into and crosscut foliation in metasedimentary host rocks of the 2666 ± 5  Ma (zircon 
U–Pb) Mt Belchers Formation (MBF) (https://asud.ga.gov.au/search-stratigraphic-units/results/35605), which are best exposed in the vicinity of the Randall Dome, a regional feature up to 30  km wide that incorporates units of the MBF 
and granitoid intrusions (Painter and Groenewald, 2001). The MBF is comprised of a distinct package of multiply deformed

Figure 32.  R epresentative examples of bulk pegmatite from the low-grade zone at Bald Hill. Laths of megacrystic (+10 cm sized) 
green–grey spodumene, as fragments of larger crystals hosted within an albite–quartz–musovite matrix, are pseudo-
morphically altered to dark-green–black, fine-grained Li–mica (muscovite/lepidolite)–chloritic mixture. Alteration occurs 
congruently from the crystal margin and proceeds inwards along fractures and spodumene cleavage planes as illustrated 
in the TIMA mineral map for #BH2250-A (also refer to Appendix 4). The TIMA mineral map is for the cross-section (yellow 
dashed line) through the single, large spodumene megacryst, BH2250-A34
Wells et al.hosted in a quartz–albite–muscovite (silvery–white) matrix 
(Fig. 32). Primary spodumene is pseudo-morphed by a dark-green–black, fine-grained, Li–mica/chlorite assemblage 
that imparts a waxy lustre to the altered crystal. Alteration 
may either completely replace primary spodumene or be preserved as a ‘reaction rim’ about the crystal margin enveloping a residual, green–grey spodumene core (Fig. 
33). Though not obvious in hand specimens, TIMA mineral 
mapping clearly shows that alteration proceeds congruently from the margin to the interior of the crystal along cracks and cleavage planes (e.g. Appendix 4).
In examples of high-grade pegmatite, megacrystic 
spodumene is highly fractured and displays a pronounced 
tabular habit (Fig. 33). Spodumene that is visibly unaltered is 
pale-grey or green–grey (e.g. BH1300 and BH1400), whereas where alteration is more obvious, spodumene is a darker grey–green (e.g. BH2700; Fig. 33). High-grade pegmatite 
examples BH1300 and BH2700 were included for detailed 
liberation analysis (refer to section, Assessment of physical and chemical processing behaviour of LCT pegmatites).
Mt Marion
Setting
The Mt Marion pegmatite suite is located approximately 40 km south of Kalgoorlie at 31°04'41"S and 121°28'00"E (Fig. 17; Smith and Ross, 2017). Jacobson et al. (2007) 
provide a detailed account of the history of the deposit 
with a more recent account by Smith and Ross (2017). Pegmatite bodies are located within the northwest–north-northwesterly striking Archean Saddle Hills greenstone 
belt. The Mt Marion pegmatite field comprises eight 
subparallel, northeast–southwesterly striking pegmatites, seven of which are mineralized with the westernmost pegmatite as unmineralized aplite (Fig. 34a). The pegmatites appear to be associated with fault splays conjugate to 
the north–northwesterly trending Karramindie shear zone 
on the eastern side of the Coolgardie Domain (PorterGeo Database, 2019, www.portergeo.com.au/database/mineinfo.asp?mineid=mn1543).
The pegmatites intrude Archean, high-Mg basalts such as 
the 2753–2692 Ma Lunnon Basalt (Hall and Wyche, 2020b), 
including komatiitic basalt, amphibole–chlorite, talc–carbonate and serpentinite rocks, separated by interflow sediments including sulphidic black shale (Smith and Ross, 
2017). A more formal description of the associated rock 
units is shown in Figure 34. The pegmatite swarm at Mt Marion occurs over a strike length of approximately 10 km in a series of gently dipping (15–30° west) subparallel sills with thickness of 2–30 m (Fig. 34a). The largest pegmatite, the 
No. 1 deposit, crops out over a strike length of approximately 
400 m, with a typical cross-section through the pegmatite shown in Figure 34b (Smith and Ross, 2017).
All but one of the pegmatite bodies are unzoned, with 
limited textural inhomogeneity and a relatively uniform 
mineralogy, consisting of spodumene (as the only Li-bearing 
phase), quartz, albite, with lesser amounts of microcline and muscovite (Smith and Ross, 2017). The exception, pegmatite body No. 3, occurs to the north of pegmatite No. 2 (not shown in Fig. 34a). The No. 3 pegmatite is 
zoned and is significantly more coarse-grained than the 
southern pegmatites, with core mineralogy consisting

Figure 33.  Repr esentative examples of bulk pegmatite (a, b and c) from the 
high-grade zone sampled at Bald Hill. Megacrystic spodumene 
displays a pronounced tabular habit and is generally less altered 
(dark green–black) than spodumene sampled in the low-grade 
zone. The large, tabular, pale-green–grey crystal in BH1300 
(a) was used in subsequent, liberation analysis and chemical 
processing work (refer to the section Assessment of physical 
and chemical processing behaviour of LCT pegmatites)35
GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western Australiaof quartz–spodumene–albite±muscovite and an outer 
wall zone of microcline–quartz–plagioclase–muscovite (Jacobson et al., 2007).
The Mt Marion pegmatites are considered by Jacobson 
et al. (2007) as representative of (predominantly) unzoned quartz–spodumene pegmatites, whereas Smith and Ross (2017) classify the pegmatites as albite–spodumene type. Textural evidence and the decrease in spodumene content 
with proximity to the 2689 ± 3  Ma (zircon U–Pb) Depot 
Granodiorite (Lu et al., 2016) suggests a potential genetic link between pegmatite intrusion and the Depot Granodiorite.
Sampling and characterization
The project team was unable to arrange for a site visit to the Mt Marion Deposit. However, Mineral Resources kindly provided a 10 kg sub-sample of their coarse ore concentrate. The concentrate has an average Li
2O grade of 5.41 wt% 
(±  0.45%), with an average P80 size of 4.69  mm (Ervins Ozolins, Laboratory Supervisor, Mineral Resources, written 
com., December 2020).
TIMA mineral mapping results (Appendix 4) reveal that 
>95% of the ore concentrate consists of five mineral phases. In decreasing order of abundance these are spodumene, quartz, muscovite, albite and microcline, and they contain 
a few, residual grains of country rock (greenstone) with a 
mineralogy consisting of actinolite–siderophyllite–biotite–cleavelandite (Appendix 4). Of the more common accessory phases carried over into the concentrate, large (2 mm-sized), Mn-bearing (F)–apatite and rare, large (2 mm-sized), 
highly fractured garnet (spessartine–almandine) grains 
were mapped (e.g. Appendix 4). Some grains occur as compound forms, mapped as an aggregate of K-feldspar–quartz–spodumene–albite (Appendix 4). Coarsely granular 
spodumene is commonly included with quartz and to a 
lesser extent muscovite. Mapping of the Si distribution highlights these inclusions and the graphic textured, alkali alteration along margins of spodumene in contact with K-/Na-feldspars (e.g. Appendix 4).
Based on the mapped phase abundance, the bulk 
composition of the concentrate can be calculated. From the averaged mineral content for two aliquots of the ore concentrate scanned using the TIMA, an equally weighted average Li
2O content of 6.12 wt% was close to the measured 
Li2O grade of 5.41%, as provided by Mineral Resources. A 
single polished round mount of hand-picked spodumene grains and muscovite books was prepared for EPMA and 
LA-ICP-MS analysis (Appendix 4).
Londonderry
Setting
The Londonderry pegmatite field is situated in the Coolgardie 
Domain (refer to Fig. 17), located approximately 25  km southwest of Coolgardie (Dittrich et al., 2019). The 
Londonderry pegmatite field is hosted by the Archean 
Kangaroo Hills greenstone belt, a northeast–southwest striking structure about 20 km in length (Dittrich et al., 2019), confined to the west and south by granitic and gneissic 
rocks of unknown affinity (Fig. 35). Both the greenstone 
terrane and post-collisional granites, related to D2 deformation during a tectonic regime with a prevalent north-  
northwest contraction (Dittrich et al., 2019), are cross-cut by an east–northeast to west–southwest striking Proterozoic 
mafic/ultramafic dyke that may be related to either the 
2420–2400 Ma Randalls or the 2420 ± 30 Ma Celebration dyke systems (Turek, 1966 as cited by Dittrich et al., 2019), which are both part of the Widgiemooltha Dolerite (Wingate 
and Romano, 2022b).
The Londonderry pegmatite field consists of four known 
pegmatites (Fig. 35): Londonderry Feldspar Quarry, Lepidolite Hill, Tantalite Hill and the Bon Ami pegmatite (Dittrich et al., 2019), of which Londonderry is the most prominent pegmatite in the field. The pegmatite at Londonderry is approximately 
1000  m long, 200–280  m wide and 15–66  m thick. It is 
described as tadpole in shape, with a northern bulbous end (Jacobson et al., 2007). The pegmatite is asymmetrically zoned from the hanging wall to the footwall, but lateral 
zonation is also reported (Jacobson et al., 2007). The principal

Sampling and characterization
As access to the Londonderry pegmatite was not possible, a request was submitted to view drillcores LHD07 and LHD19 at the Joe Lord Core library facilities. From the core logging 
description in the historical Western Mining Corporation 
(WMC) logging report (Report A126, M267/6 Item 10717) as summarized in Appendix 1, only LHD07 was sampled, with 16 intervals sampled (Fig. 36) of which eight intervals 
were selected for analysis (Fig. 37; Appendix 1 – selected 
intervals outlined in red in core tray images). It is noted that the selected core intervals were not large enough to prepare polished slabs, so only polished rounds (25 mm diameter) were prepared for study.
The pegmatite has sharp contacts with hanging wall and 
footwall greenstone units, with aplitic-chilled margins about 20 cm thick (Fig. 36; Appendix 1). The hanging wall aplite grades into an albite–quartz–muscovite pegmatite before the main quartz–petalite/petalite-ore zone (Appendix 1). 
The main petalite-ore zone is highlighted in Figure 36, with 
petalite-bearing intervals selected for analysis shown in more detail in Figure 37. The albite–quartz–muscovite zone

Kathleen Valley
Setting
The Kathleen Valley Lithium–Tantalum Project is located approximately 50 km north of Leinster or 680 km northeast of Perth (Jacobson et al., 2007), on the western edge of 
the Kalgoorlie Terrane in the Yakabindie Domain of the 
Norseman–Wiluna greenstone belt (see Fig. 17). The belt consists predominantly of mafic (2817–2736  Ma Mt Goode Basalt) and ultramafic volcanics as well as 
considerable volumes of clastic sediments (2665–2640 Ma 
Jones Creek Conglomerate), minor felsic volcanics and the 2735 ± 3 Ma Kathleen Valley Gabbro (e.g. Bunting and 
Williams, 1979: Wyche, 2021). In the Kathleen Valley area 
greenstones have been metamorphosed to upper greenschist 
– lower amphibolite facies metamorphic grade (Liontown 
Resources, 2021).
The Kathleen Valley pegmatite was previously reported as one 
of nine pegmatite occurrences trending north–south along a 
strike length of approximately 10 km (Jacobson et al., 2007). 
However, new work by Liontown Resources has delineated 
twenty mineralized pegmatites occurring as two, northwest–
southeast trending pegmatite swarms defined by the Mt Mann pegmatite (Jacobson et al., 2007) and the Kathleen’s 
Corner pegmatite swarm situated about 1.7 km to the north 
(Fig. 38a; Liontown Resources, https://www.ltresources.com.
au/kathleen-valley-lithium-project, viewed 11–06–21). The 
shallow dipping Kathleen’s Corner swarm, which contains 
about 90% of the project pegmatites, and the steeper 
dipping, southwestern Mt Mann pegmatite are interpreted 
to merge at depth to form a single, thick and moderately 
dipping mineralized body (Fig. 38b). Currently, the Kathleen 
Valley project has a mineral resource estimate of 156 Mt @ 
1.4% Li
2O and 130 ppm Ta2O5 (Liontown Resources, https://
www.ltresources.com.au/kathleen-valley-lithium-project , viewed 11–06–21). Currently, there is limited description available for the pegmatite mineralogy or textural relationships of the host pegmatites.
The Mt Mann and Kathleen’s Corner pegmatite swarms are 
hosted by the 2735 ± 3 Ma Kathleen Valley Gabbro (Jacobson 
et al., 2007). This is an overturned, composite, layered 
intrusion of predominantly gabbroic nature with anorthosite to 
amphibolitized pyroxenite, formed from at least two episodes of magma emplacement (Bunting and Williams, 1979). The gabbro was intruded by dolerite dykes, presumably related to the 2400 Ma Widgiemooltha dyke suite, prior to the onset of regional metamorphism (Bunting and Williams, 1979). Textural evidence is consistent with a younger age for granite to the north of the gabbro (Bunting and Williams, 1979), such as the 2689 ± 17  Ma Mt Keith Granodiorite (Roddick et al., 1976 – whole rock Rb–Sr age) in the area between the Jones Creek and Mount Keith Homestead.
Sampling and characterization
Access to drillcores at the Kathleen Valley Deposit was 
kindly made available by Liontown Resources (Jamie Day, 
Exploration Manager, written com., February 2021). Four drillcores were made available for sampling: KVDD0018, 
KVDD0049, KVDD0076 and KVGT008, with their locations 
at the Kathleen Valley Deposit shown in Figure 39. Of these, 
holes KVDD0018 (local grid coordinates X = 256623m; Y 
= 6958310m) and KVDD0076 (local grid coordinates X = 
257865m; Y = 6959337m) were selected for inclusion in the present study. KVDD0018 intersects the southern extent of 
the Mt Mann pegmatite (Fig. 38) and is lepidolite-bearing, whereas KVDD0076 is lepidolite-free and intersects high-grade 
Li and is tentatively interpreted by Liontown Resources as the merged zone of the Mt Mann and Kathleen’s Corner pegmatite 
swarms (e.g. Fig. 38).
Core tray imagery for KVDD0018 is shown in Figure 40, with 
sampling locations highlighted and shown in more detail in Figure 41. Core intervals sampled from KVDD0076 are presented in Figure 42. The single, thickest portion of the Mt Mann pegmatite intersected by KVDD0018, as exposed in the 
core trays presented, is first encountered at approximately

Wells et al.42.0 m and continues to a depth of approximately 62 m (Fig. 
40). Close to the upper pegmatite–greenstone contact, the pegmatite consists of a 2-m thick zone, with the middle, 1-m thick portion comprising fine-grained lepidolite in a granular quartz matrix, with fine, acicular (4–5 cm long x 1–2 mm 
wide), pink–lilac spodumene. The fine-grained lepidolite 
imparts a strong purple colour to the pegmatite. Either side of this first lepidolite zone, the pegmatite consists of a variably coloured, granular textured albite–quartz zone, free 
of spodumene (e.g. sample #2; Fig. 41; Appendix 4).
The main pegmatite body, over a depth of 46–62 m, consists 
of quartz–spodumene with variably distributed albite, as 
massive, blocky crystals to +10 cm in size, and fine-grained lepidolite. Spodumene occurs as randomly oriented, pale-grey–lilac, acicular crystals generally 4–5  cm long and

Wells et al.3–4 mm wide that display as an inter-woven, mesh texture 
(e.g. samples #4 and #5; Fig. 41) but can develop an extreme acicular habit with crystals +10 cm in length and 3 mm wide, 
grading towards the middle of this zone (Fig. 41).
Fine-grained (primary) lepidolite imparts a purple colour to 
the pegmatite, particularly for the upper and lower margins of the ‘meshed’ spodumene zone. Spodumene in the upper ‘mesh’ zone has been altered, pseudo-morphically replaced 
by a secondary ‘quartz–elbaite–cleavelandite–beryl’ mixture 
with minor, residual spodumene as detected by TIMA mineral mapping (e.g. sample #3; Appendix 4).
Below the main pegmatite body, comparatively thin 
pegmatite units interfinger with thicker greenstone units 
(e.g. 66.7 – 79.6 m and 81.5 – 91.0 m; Fig. 42; Appendix 1). 
In underlying, intersected pegmatite units (e.g. #10 @ 80 m), spodumene is very coarsely crystalline with a lath-like habit to +10 cm long x 10 mm wide (Appendix 1). In the deepest units, pegmatite consists of fine-grained, spodumene-free, 
quartz–albite–lepidolite hosting elevated Ta mineralization 
(e.g. sample #12; Fig. 42).
On the basis of the drillcore available for examination, 
KVDD0076 intersected two main pegmatite bodies 
(Appendix 1; Fig. 42). Greenstone at 189.3  m (base) and 
238.8  m (top) constrains a quartz–spodumene pegmatite 
type, with white, coarsely crystalline, acicular (+10 cm long x 10 mm wide) spodumene (Fig. 42; Appendix 3). Pegmatite within the wall contact zone displays the classic quartz–albite, graphic texture (Appendix 1). Spodumene can be 
crosscut by albite–muscovite veins (e.g. Fig. 42; Appendix 3), 
which can make up a significant proportion of the pegmatite composition (e.g. sample #2, Fig. 42; Appendix 4).
The deeper pegmatite body intersected in KVDD0076, 
over the depth range 258.26 – 293.5  m (Appendix 1), is 
mineralogically monotonous, consisting of quartz–albite–
muscovite–spodumene in varying proportions, but is texturally highly variable (Fig. 42). Towards the top of this pegmatite unit, bi-coloured megacrysts of spodumene are 
randomly distributed within a massive quartz matrix (e.g. 
sample #4; Fig. 42) with zones of granular textured quartz–albite hosting few muscovite booklets and smaller, acicular (3  cm x 1  mm) spodumene (Appendix 1). With depth, the white–tan coloured pegmatite displays a predominantly 
granular texture consisting of white, randomly oriented, 
acicular spodumene with quartz–albite and less commonly muscovite (Fig. 42; Appendix 1).41

GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western AustraliaDalgaranga
Setting
The Dalgaranga pegmatite is located approximately 70 km 
northwest of Mount Magnet (Fig. 17) and forms part of the Dalgaranga pegmatite field, which also includes the 
Niobe (formerly Mount Farmer) and Breakaway pegmatites 
(Jacobson et al., 2007). The Dalgaranga pegmatite is the most significant pegmatite in the field and is hosted in gabbroic rocks of the 2735–2711 Ma Yalgowra Suite (Ivanic, 
2019) and peltitic schist of the 2670–2635 Ma Greensleeves 
Formation (Van Kranendonk et al., 2013) that forms part of the Dalgaranga greenstone belt in the western Youanmi Terrane. Greenstones are intruded by granitic rocks of the c. 2790 Ma Big Bell Suite to the southeast, northwest and 
northeast and the 2787–2733  Ma Cullculli Suite (Zibra, 
2022) to the southwest. It is typical for greenstones to be in sheared contacts with these granitic suites (Fig. 43).Striking northeast, the pegmatite outcrops for about 137 m in length, is 12 m wide and shows a moderate dip (20–40°) to the southeast (Jacobson et al., 2007). Compositional 
zoning is expressed downwards from the hanging wall as 
consisting of a 0.5-m thick zinnwaldite zone, a 1-m thick albite–zinnwaldite zone and a 2–3-m thick core of grey quartz (Fig. 43). The albite–zinnwaldite and zinnwaldite 
sequence repeats to the footwall (Jacobson et al., 2007). 
The deposit has been mined for beryl and tantalite for nearly 80 years, with Ta mineralization occurring mainly as tapiolite and tantalite, with lesser microlite (Fetherston, 2004).
Sampling and characterization
Site access to the Dalgaranga pegmatite was not possible, although drillcore DD1 was available to the project via the Joe Lord Core Library. Based on details provided by 
Pancontinental Mining Ltd, Annual Mining Report (Hall, 
1988), DD1 is located approximately 10 m north of the quartz core of the Dalgaranga pegmatite, at the gabbro–pegmatite hanging wall contact (local grid E = 9993m, N = 10195.5m). 
DD1 is declined to the south and intersects the quartz–
albite zone and quartz–albite–zinnwaldite footwall zone, underlying the quartz core (Hall, 1988). An approximately  
1.3-m thick zone of Ta mineralization, occurring within mainly massive albite towards the base of the quartz–albite 
zone (e.g. Appendix 3), is intersected by DD1 at a depth of 
≈18.5 m with a Ta-grade of 2000 ppm (Hall, 1988).

(#241442) (Fig. 45; Appendix 3).
Localized occurrences of massive albite were detected in 
the underlying quartz–albite–muscovite zone (e.g. #241437; Fig. 45), which also hosts minor Ta mineralization (Appendix 13). Fetherston (2004) reports that Ta mineralization occurs 
mainly as tapiolite, (Fe
2+,Mn2+)(Ta,Nb)2O6 and tantalite, 
(Mn, Fe)Ta2O6, with lesser microlite, (Na,Ca)2Ta2O6(O,OH,F). 
However, Hall (1988) considers that microlite is the principal 
source of Ta at Dalgaranga. Characterization of the Ta 
mineralogy at Dalgaranga is discussed in more detail in 
Tantalum–niobium geochemistry.

GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western AustraliaLCT pegmatite of the Pilbara region 
Pilgangoora
Setting
Pilgangoora is located about 97  km south-southeast of 
Porth Hedland (Fig. 3), situated on the western side of the McPhee Range (Fetherston, 2004). The geological setting 
of the Pilgangoora pegmatites was only briefly summarized 
by Fetherston (2004) in relation to Sn–Ta mineralization but was recently described in more detail by Sweetapple (2017). Pegmatites are hosted by the north-trending, 
East Strelley greenstone belt, as part of the east Pilbara 
terrane, in a sequence of highly deformed, fault bounded, mafic-dominated rocks that protrude into the Carlindi Batholith (Sweetapple, 2017). Rock units assigned to the Euro Basalt (dated at 3350–3335 Ma) form the lower part 
of the Kelly group (Fig. 19). Schistose and sheared talc–
chlorite–carbonate ultramafics (Dalton Suite at 3185 Ma) occur along the eastern boundary, which also hosts the abandoned Iron Stirrup Au Deposit (Baker et al., 2002, as 
cited by Sweetapple, 2017).
In the project area, tholeiitic basalt is the dominant lithology 
with a thin, interflow sequence of metasediments (e.g. lithic wacke/siltstone+quartz, greywacke and conglomerate). In the centre of the project area a 500-m thick, intrusive 
sequence of layered ultramafics (peridotite, pyroxenite and 
Mg–Fe–dolerite) occurs (Sweetapple, 2017; Fig. 46). The Pilgangoora pegmatites are moderately dipping (20–60°) to the east, occurring as en echelon dykes and sills (Sweetapple, 2017). Columbite–tantalite at Pilgangoora 
was dated by secondary ion mass spectrometry Pb–Pb 
analysis to yield a date of 2879 ± 5 Ma (Kinny, 2000).
The Pilgangoora pegmatites occur as three main groups 
(Sweetapple, 2017) in the central project area (Western, Centre and Eastern groups), with the Southern and 
north Monster pegmatites as outlying groups (Fig. 46). 
Pegmatites at Pilgangoora are quasi-homogeneous, although anisotropic mineral assemblages are noted and include very coarse or megacrystic spodumene, aplitic layering (fined-grained, quartz–feldspar granite-type) and 
locally distinct border units (Sweetapple, 2017). Compared 
to pegmatites of the Western and Central units, the Eastern group pegmatite is texturally and mineralogically distinct and contains more lepidolite, (grey) spodumene and 
discrete albitic units (Sweetapple, 2017).

Selected intervals of drillcore (PD001 to PD008) from the 
Western Pegmatite group (Fig. 46; Appendix 4) were kindly provided by Altura Mining (Stephen Barber) for inclusion in 
the present study. LCT pegmatite hosted in both mafic and 
ultramafic units were provided to enable a comparative evaluation of the host rock on pegmatite formation (Appendix 4). Photographs of Pilgangoora drillcore hosted 
in either mafic or ultramafic are shown in Figures 46 and 
47, respectively. Several of the core intervals provided are comparatively short (≈10 cm in length), with the thickness of the pegmatite unit and relative position of the core section within each pegmatite unit unknown.However, interrogation of the optical imaging (Figs 47, 48) and TIMA mineral mapping results (Appendix 4) have been useful in determining the source pegmatite lithology in each 
case. As reported by Jacobson et al. (2007), Pilgangoora 
pegmatites are classified into three main compositional groups: quartz–spodumene–albite–microcline, quartz–microcline–albite (acc. muscovite) and quartz–muscovite–
microcline (+accessory cassiterite and plagioclase) 
pegmatites. All pegmatite examples occurring in mafic host rocks (Fig. 46) can be classified as belonging to the quartz–spodumene–albite–microcline lithology, which can be considered as high-grade according to Sweetapple 
(2017). Of the pegmatite examples hosted in ultramafic 
units, spodumene-free PD002 (@29.95  m) is classified as low-grade, quartz–muscovite–microcline pegmatite, and the deeper interval (@192.8 m) in drillhole PD004 as 
an aplite (low-grade, albite–quartz) pegmatite (Fig. 48). 
The remaining pegmatite intervals can also be classified as examples of high-grade, quartz–spodumene–albite–microcline pegmatite (Fig. 48).
Fluorapatite is uncommon in the quartz–spodumene–
feldspar-type pegmatite and in the quartz–muscovite 
pegmatite lithology. Where present, (F)–apatite occurs 
as large, subhedral grains to ≈600  µm, with variable Mn contents of 1.6 – 5.1 wt% (e.g. PD004-67.8 m, PD001-36 m; PD005-83.9 m). Manganiferous, (F)–apatite containing 
about 3 wt% Mn is more common in the aplite pegmatite 
types and exhibits well-developed lobate and poikiloblastic forms (e.g. PD004-191.8 m). TIMA mineral mapping also detected several accessory phases, such as garnet (PD002-29 m, PD004-67 m, PD004-191 m in skeletal form), PD006-
66 m, PD008-66 m fractured/altered large 3-mm zoned 
grain. A single, 500-µm sized, fractured (Ce)-monazite grain was mapped in PD005-46.5 m (refer to Appendix 4).
Discrete Ta–Nb mineralization was uncommon in the 
pegmatite examined from Pilgangoora, occurring mainly 
as rare, columbite–tantalite typically 20–50 µm in size, 
occasionally to 100–150  µm in size and rarely as larger prismatic grains to about 1  mm in size (#PD005-84  m, Appendix 4). Columbite–tantalite detected at Pilgangoora 
exhibits a variable Ta:Nb ratio and no consistent trend in 
the Ta:Nb ratio could be attributed to the host rock type (i.e. mafic vs ultramafic).
TIMA mineral mapping also identified extensive 
development of graphic-textured alteration of spodumene along crystal margins in contact with Na/K-feldspars, 
particularly where spodumene contacts albite (e g. PD003-
33  m, Appendix 4). In addition, extensive Fe–chlorite alteration of spodumene was detected, mapped as veins crosscutting crystals and developed along cleavage planes 
(e.g. PD008-66.5 m, Appendix 4). This is discussed in more 
detail in section, Spodumene morphology and alteration: indicators of pegmatite crystallization evolution.46

Figure 47.  D rillcore intervals of pegmatite at Pilgangoora in mafic host rocks. A brief mineralogical description, based on TIMA mineral mapping 
results (refer to Appendix 3), is provided for each core interval. All pegmatite examples can be classified as belonging to the high-grade, 
quartz–spodumene–albite–microcline compositional group (Jacobson et al., 2007)48
Wells et al.Geochemical analysis and 
mineral characterization
Initial geochemical characterization was undertaken to 
enable the comparative analysis of pegmatite deposits using bulk-rock compositional data. However, due to the 
coarsely crystalline and heterogeneous nature of the study 
samples, only those samples (pit and drillcore) where sufficient volumes of represented material were collected and submitted for bulk geochemical analysis.
To further aid the assessment and geological classification of 
the LCT pegmatites examined in this study, their mineralogical associations and textural features were characterized by extensive application of TIMA mineral mapping. TIMA mineral-mapping results and interpretations for each rare-element 
pegmatite deposit examined in this study are summarized 
in Appendix 3. These results were used to aid mineral identification, provide textural information through mineral–mineral associations, inform the geochemical and phase 
compositional analysis of phases of interest at each deposit, 
and aid in interpretation of their crystallization sequence and characterization of alteration styles and associated mineralogy.
Initial TIMA mineral mapping was used to identify regions 
of interest, specifically minerals suitable for follow-
up compositional analysis by LA-ICP-MS and EPMA 
measurement (refer to Appendix 2). This section first describes the bulk-rock chemical composition of pegmatite before discussion of more detailed compositional analysis.
Though typically present in pegmatites, minerals such as 
beryl, garnet, rutile and zircon occurred sporadically as accessory phases in the LCT pegmatites examined. Thus, quantitative mineral compositional analysis focused on the mineral chemistry of spodumene, feldspar and mica (as 
muscovite and lepidolite) to identify compositional trends 
with potential application as exploration tools or as indicators of pegmatite provenance. Established mineral compositional trends were compared to other global LCT deposits, 
where possible, to place a comparative ranking of WA LCT 
pegmatites on a global scale. In addition, semi-quantitative SEM–EDS analysis of the Ta–Nb-bearing mineralogy was used to characterize trends in the fractionation evolution of the pegmatites as expressed in changes in the Ta:Nb and 
Fe:Mn ratios.
The main objectives and key findings of the work undertaken 
in this section are summarized below: 
1 Geochemistr y signature of minerals to identify pegmatite 
associations, which can assist in targeting LCT pegmatites:
•
 Cha nges in mica (muscovite/lepidolite) composition 
followed well-correlated and highly predictable trends in relation to their Li and F contents, Li:Al and Li:Si, and K:Rb ratios.
•
 Cha nges in mica composition described may provide 
a useful tool in greenfields/brownfields exploration in assessing pegmatite mineralization potential (Li, Ta) based on mica composition as in the field:
o Mica (muscovite/lepidolite) is more easily identified 
compared to the typically white, Li-bearing and barren 
(feldspar, quartz) phases that also occur
o Mica  is typically present as coarsely crystalline ‘books’ 
of well-defined crystalso M ica highly amenable to compositional analysis using 
field portable instruments (e.g. XRF, LIBS).
• Changes in the Ta–Nb mineralogy (e.g. Ta:Nb and Mn:Fe 
ratios) may provide an additional exploration tool useful 
for assessing pegmatite fractionation and mineralization style (i.e. Ta vs Nb content).
2 A ssessment of the deportment of Li and other elements 
of interest and associated minerals in pegmatite deposits, through a quantitative understanding of the mineralogical deportment of both economically important (Li, Nb, Ta) 
and environmentally deleterious (F, Mn) elements within 
minerals associated with pegmatite ores:
•
 Spodumene typically has Li– Al–Si contents close to 
stoichiometric LiAlSi2O6:
o Alteration systematically removes Li from spodumene 
(at 8.03 wt% for the pure pyroxene), with lowest Li2O 
content of 5.15 wt% for spodumene at Mt Cattlin
o Iron and Mn (max. 1.2 wt% combined) were the main impurities
o Sodium, at 500–1200 ppm, was the other main trace impurity.
•
 B ased on their textural characteristics, two main 
pegmatite-alteration styles that preferentially impact 
spodumene were defined:
1. Comple te/near-complete, pseudo-morphic 
replacement of spodumene by a massive, dark-green–
black, Li-mica/cookeite assemblage
o Associated with thermal overprinting event/s, possibly related to dyke intrusion
o Alteration introduces significant K (+Fe, Mg, Rb and Mn) with near-complete loss of Li.
2. Symplectic (graphic-textured), in-situ alteration where 
spodumene is in contact with Na/K-feldspar
o Forms microscopic, graphic-textured, quartz–spodumene intergrowth (SQI-type)
o Affects nearly all LCT pegmatites examined.
3 D erive a classification scheme that is useful in exploration 
targeting for economic LCT pegmatites and grade control 
in mining operations:
•	The majority of pegmatites belong to one of three main complex sub-types:
o Spodumene — Greenbushes, Kathleen Valley, Dome 
North, Mt Marion
o Petalite — Londonderry
o Lepidolite — Sinclair Caesium.
•	Exceptions are Mt Cattlin, Bald Hill and Pilgangoora, 
classed as albite–spodumene types, and the Dalgaranga 
pegmatite, which is classed as an albite-type.49
GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western Australia•	Pegmatite classification is important to informing the 
most appropriate processing route that accommodates differences in the main Li host and associated mineralogy.
4 P etrochronological and geochemical synthesis of LCT 
pegmatite mineral systems in Western Australia:
•	Geochronological characterization of the Greenbushes, Pilgangoora, Dalgaranga, Bald Hill and Londonderry LCT pegmatites was undertaken by:
o U–Pb dating of zircon
o 40Ar/39Ar dating of spodumene
o 40Ar/39Ar dating of muscovite.
•	Zircon U–Pb ages of 2643–2629  Ma obtained for project 
samples, consistent with other WA LCT pegmatites:
o Coincides with a major period of global pegmatite 
emplacement from 2650–2600 Ma
o A revised, older age for Greenbushes pegmatite at 2631 ± 4 Ma is a significant new finding
o The relatively low U content (usually <100  ppm but also <<500  ppm) and relatively small grain size (predominantly <100  µm) of zircon analysed in the current study suggest they are inherited and not of pegmatitic origin
o Thus, zircon U–Pb ages place a maximum age constraint on the timing of pegmatite crystallization.
•	
40Ar/39Ar dating determined a robust, plateau age of 
c. 2605  Ma for muscovite from Bald Hill:
o Compares to 2643 ± 10 Ma zircon U–Pb age for Bald Hill, indicating that cooling took place deep in the crust over a period of ≈40 Ma
o Similar interpretation made for Londonderry LCT pegmatite.
•	
40Ar/39Ar dating of Mt Cattlin spodumene established a 
robust plateau age of c.  1100  Ma:
o Possibly related to spodumene alteration by a hydrothermal resetting event, from fluid flow associated with localized, mafic dyke emplacement.
Bulk-rock composition
Bulk compositional results indicate that the majority of 
pegmatite samples have SiO2 contents >65 wt% and plot in 
the granite and granodiorite fields in the total alkali–silica diagram (Fig. 49). The sample plotting in the ‘Diorite’ field is 
sample BH1480, whereas gabbroic and doleritic samples 
from Mt Cattlin plot near the ‘Gabbro’ field (Fig. 49). Shand index plots, A/NK vs A/CNK (molar Al
2O3/(Na2O+K2O) vs Al2O3/
(CaO+Na2O+K2O), confirm that all examined pegmatites are 
strongly per-aluminous (A/CNK>>1), while a few samples (Pilgangoora, Greenbushes — Partington et al., 1995 and 
GSWA) are mildly per-aluminous with A/CNK values of 
1.0–1.2 (Fig. 50). The per-aluminous nature is suggestive of 
S-type granitic melts as the parent source of the pegmatite (e.g. Bradley et al., 2017). Sample data points that plot on or 
close to a line of unit slope attest to the very low Ca content of 
the pegmatites examined in this study (Appendix 3).MAW62 29.03.22syenitegranite

Wells et al.Spodumene composition
While spodumene compositions do not show any significant 
deviation from the ideal formula, LiAlSi2O6, they can contain 
minor contents of Fe, Mn, Na, K, Mg and Ca in the structure (Deer et al., 1980; London and Burt, 1982). A slight excess of 
SiO
2 is also reported for some spodumene analyses for Si 
atoms per formula unit (apfu) values slightly greater than 2 
for stoichiometric spodumene (Deer et al., 1980). This may 
represent small amounts of SiO2 originally in solid-solution 
with the high-temperature polymorph, β-spodumene (Deer 
et al., 1980). Discussion of the phase-stability relationships 
of Li–alumino–silicates is given in the section Pegmatite 
mineral fractionation. Alternatively, the common occurrence of small-phase inclusions, such as mica (as described in detail in section, Trace element associations: vein in-filling), 
may also account for the slight excess in silica.
A plot of the Li:Si vs Li:Al ratio, as derived from a combination 
of LA-ICP-MS analysis of Li (refer to Appendix 3) and EPMA 
analysis of Al and Si (e.g. Appendix 3), enables an evaluation 
of the relative enrichment or depletion of Li in spodumene (Fig. 51). Spodumene Li:Si and Li:Al (apfu) ratios are strongly 
correlated, with the majority of the spodumene analysed 
close to or slightly depleted compared to stoichiometric spodumene (Fig. 51). Some spodumene from Bald Hill,  
Mt Marion and Dome North are slightly enriched in Li compared to stoichiometric spodumene (Fig. 51). In 
contrast, Pilgangoora spodumene is either slightly enriched 
(mafic host) or depleted (ultramafic host) in silicon. Spodumene from the Greenbushes C3 and C1 pits has a Li content very close to that expected for pure spodumene, 
while spodumene in drillcore C3DD024 is moderately 
depleted in Li ( Fig. 51 ). Spodumene from Mt Cattlin displays 
the greatest variation in Li content, with spodumene being slightly enriched in Li to spodumene being the most severely depleted at a Li content of 0.7191  apfu (equivalent to 
2.55 wt% Li — LA-ICP-MS analysis) (Fig. 51), compared to a Li content of  3.73% for stoichiometric spodumene.
The change in spodumene composition follows a highly predictable (r
2 = 0.992) and consistent trend (i.e. decrease), 
with the relative change ( ∆) in apfu following the trend 
Li>Al>Si (e.g. Li ∆apfu ≈ 28%; Al ∆apfu ≈ 4%; Si ∆apfu ≈ 2.8%). 
Images of the Mt Cattlin spodumene samples analysed in Figure 51 show a progressive darkening from pink–white

Figure 51.  Li: Si vs Li:Al ratio of spodumene from selected LCT pegmatites. The black data point at Li:Si = 0.5 and Li:Al = 1.0 is for stoichiometric 
spodumene and was not included in the regression analysis. Al and Si apfu values were calculated from EPMA data, whereas Li apfu values 
are from LA-ICP-MS analyses. Decrease in the Li:Al and Li:Si values is mostly related to the leaching of Li with increasing alteration of  
Mt Cattlin spodumene. Examples of Mt Cattlin spodumene, as indicated in the plot, are presented below and show a progressive change 
in colour from pink–white to green to grey in response to increasing spodumene alteration, and finally to black–green ‘spodumene’ that is 
completely pseudo-morphically replaced by secondary, low Li-bearing mica51
GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western Australiapseudo-morphically replaced by black–green secondary 
Li-bearing micas (MC600) in response to increasing 
spodumene alteration with almost the complete loss of Li 
(Fig. 51).
A ternary, Li–Si–Al plot more clearly demonstrates the 
change in spodumene composition in response to the effect 
of alteration, particularly for Mt Cattlin spodumene (Fig. 52). 
The structural formulae of the majority of spodumene in 
WA LCT pegmatites included in this study plot close to that 
expected for stoichiometric spodumene (Fig. 51). However, the composition of spodumene in the Greenbushes drillcore and, in particular, from Mt Cattlin shows a consistent loss of Li (i.e. leaching) and concomitant increase in the Si (apfu) 
content (Fig. 52) as the severity of alteration increases 
(refer to Fig. 52). In contrast, Al apfu values are relatively unchanged; that is, they are unaffected by alteration (Fig. 52).
Spodumene element impurities
The most significant impurities in spodumene are Fe and Mn with contents ranging from 500 to 1200  ppm. Figure 
53 shows the variation in Fe and Mn content, expressed as 
apfu, observed in the structure of spodumene in samples 
collected in this study. 
At Kathleen Valley, spodumene from Kathleen’s Corner is 
markedly enriched in Fe and Mn compared to spodumene 
from Mt Mann (Fig. 53). In the drillcore samples examined 
at Pilgangoora, there was no obvious difference between 
Fe and Mn content in spodumene for pegmatites hosted in ultramafic or mafic rocks. For spodumenes from other 
deposits there were no obvious trends in the Fe and Mn compositions with host-rock type. High Fe and Mn spodumene in Mt Cattlin can be attributed to spodumene which has undergone late-stage alteration.
The (Fe+Mn) impurities appear unrelated to changes in 
the Li:Al (apfu), which for stoichiometric spodumene has 
a value of 1 (Fig. 53). A slight depletion in the Li content 
for spodumene in the Greenbushes core decreases the 
Li:Al ratio (to about 0.9), whereas alteration of spodumene and the associated loss of Li results in the altered 
spodumene from Bald Hill (concentrate) and Mt Cattlin, with a near-constant Li:Al apfu value of 0.72. (Fig. 53 ). 
Comparable (Fe+Mn) apfu values (0.02 – 0.034) were 
reported for spodumene from the Kolmozero pegmatite field, in the Kola region, Russia (Morozova et al., 2020), 
and for spodumene (0.006 – 0.035, up to 0.088  apfu) from 
predominantly Canadian and US pegmatites (Filip et al., 
2006). Incorporation within spodumene is considered to be accommodated by a portion of Fe
2+ substituting for 
Al3+ on the M1 site, with minor replacement of Li+ by Fe 
and Mn on the M2 site (Morozova et al., 2020). Although Fe is generally assigned to the ferrous state, Mössbauer’s spectroscopic analysis of spodumene confirmed that both 
Fe
2+ and Fe3+ can be hosted by spodumene (e.g. Filip et al., 
2006). The partitioning of Fe across the M1 and M2 sites 
within spodumene may account for the relatively constant behaviour of the Li:Al ratio with increasing impurity content 
(Fig. 53). The presence of element impurities, particularly 
elevated contents of Fe and Mn has implications for the 
calcination processing of spodumene, where exsolution 
of Fe and Mn from spodumene, as oxides associated 
with ‘blow-out’ structures, may promote spodumene decrepitation, as discussed in section, Partial melting of mica in calcined spodumene.Si AlLi

Wells et al.The other major element impurity of significance measured 
in spodumene was Na, which showed comparable and consistent contents ranging from 500 to 1200 ppm across 
all pegmatite deposits (Fig. 54). Similar Na contents were 
reported for spodumene (1039–1558  ppm Na) from the Kolmozero pegmatite (Morozova et al., 2020); in the Leviäkangas, Syväjärvi and Rapasaaret pegmatites (668–
1261 ppm Na), Finland (Ahtola et al., 2015); and in spodumene 
(from 668 ppm up to 5267  ppm) examined by Filip et al. (2006). At the Tanco pegmatite, Na can occur as the dominant trace element impurity, particularly in secondary spodumene formed by the replacement of petalite (e.g. Černý et al., 1996; 
Stilling et al., 2006). The presence of Na likely occurs via 
the replacement of small amounts of Li on the M2 site of spodumene (Deer et al., 1980; Filip et al., 2006).
Normalized, trace element patterns for spodumene from 
selected WA LCT pegmatites show variable enrichment–
depletion patterns for the majority of the trace elements analysed (Fig. 55). Though highly variable, only Ga (32–
147 ppm; average 85 ppm) and Sn were consistently enriched in spodumene across all LCT pegmatites, with enrichment 
of Sn varying by two orders of magnitude from 8  ppm to 
≈700 ppm (e.g. Fig. 56).
The REE contents of spodumene are unsurprisingly low due to 
their incompatibility (large ionic radius, trivalent coordination) in the spodumene structure (Fig. 57). However, there was 
no consistent depletion trend or anomaly that might enable 
discrimination of the WA LCT pegmatites. Future work should consider comparing REE patterns for spodumene from other Australian (not accessible in the current study) and worldwide LCT pegmatites to determine if such plots could be applied as 
a provenance indicator to ‘fingerprint’ the regional (country) 
source of LCT pegmatites.
Mica composition
Micas can be an important host for Li mineralization, although they may comprise only a relatively small proportion of pegmatite-phase composition. The lepidolite solid-solution series of Al-bearing micas, polylithionite–trilithionite, represent a sequence of high-grade Li (polylithionite) to low-grade Li 
(trilithionite) tri-octahedral micas (Aylmore et al., 2018a).  
Di-octahedral, Al–mica muscovite is a low-grade host of Li with contents up to 1.5% Li (Aylmore et al., 2018a). Micas can 
also be a source of deleterious elements such as F, which can be problematic in the processing of pegmatite ore (Aylmore et al., 2018a).
In the process of crystallization of a pegmatite melt, 
the relative abundance of incompatible elements like 
Rb, Cs, Li, Mn, Ga, Tl, Sn, Ta and F increases, such that 
the composition of the final crystallization products, as expressed by element ratios such as K:Rb, K:Cs, Pilgangoora

GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western AustraliaK:Tl, Fe:Mn and Al:Ga, can potentially be used as a 
measure of the relative degree of crystal fractionation in a variety of pegmatites (e.g. Shaw et al., 2016). As the 
fractionation evolution continues, the concentration of 
these incompatible elements increases, resulting in the concomitant decrease in element ratios such as K:Rb, K:Cs, K:Tl, Fe:Mn and Al:Ga (Shaw et al., 2016). As the mica 
structure is capable of hosting most of these elements, 
compositional analysis of mica (muscovite and lepidolite) was undertaken to characterize the deportment of deleterious elements, such as F, and to determine if trends in K:Rb, K:Cs, K:Tl, Fe:Mn and Al:Ga exist that can be used 
to infer fractionation evolution (Shaw et al., 2016).
Measured Li and F contents of muscovite and lepidolite 
show a strong, positive relationship (Fig. 58), consistent with previous work (Aylmore et al., 2018a), indicative of the simultaneous uptake of Li and F during mica crystallization. 
The same trend is observed for micas from Canadian rare-
metal pegmatites, including the Tanco Deposit (e.g. Ċerný et al., 1996; Ċerný et al., 2012b; Fig. 58). The Mt Cattlin and Sinclair lepidolites are the most fluorinated with contents of ≈4.5 wt% F and with correspondingly elevated Li contents 
of about 2.2 – 2.5  wt% (Fig. 58). In contrast, Mt Marion 
and Dome North muscovite were consistently the least 
fluorinated and contained the least Li (Fig. 58). Bridging the 
compositional ‘end-member’ extremes, muscovite from the 
Sinclair, Londonderry and Mt Cattlin displayed the greatest 
variation in Li and F composition (Fig. 58).
Values of the mica Al:Si ratio were strongly (R
2  =  0.872) 
and inversely related to Li content (Fig. 59a), similar to 
the findings of Aylmore et al. (2018a), indicating that 
the uptake of Li replaces Al in the mica octahedral site 
(Aylmore et al., 2018a). The strongly related, curvi-linear Pilgangoora

in LCT pegmatites of the current study. Weight percentage F 
values are from EPMA analysis, while Li wt% values were 
measured by LA-ICP-MS analysis. Lepidolites are more highly 
fluoridated with a correspondingly greater Li content than 
muscovite. Comparative data for the analysis of mica from 
Canadian pegmatites (e.g. Tanco — Ċerný et al., 1996; and the 
Red Cross Lake pegmatite — Ċerný et al., 2012b) were excluded 
from the regression analysis54
Wells et al.relationship between Li:Si and Li:Al ratios (Fig. 59b), across 
the muscovite and lepidolite compositional range, also supports the depletion of Si from the tetrahedral site in 
the di- and tri-octahedral micas. While it is considered 
that Li uptake in di-octahedral muscovite occurs via the substitution of octahedral Al
3+ (Aylmore et al., 2018a), 
these results indicate that the substitution mechanism of Li in muscovite is more complex and continues into tri-
octahedral lepidolite. As noted for the relationship between 
the F and Li content of muscovite (e.g. Fig. 58), the Sinclair and Mt Cattlin lepidolite, with the highest Li content (about 2.3 – 2.5 wt%) were also the most depleted in Al. Similarly, 
Bald Hill and Kathleen Valley muscovite were the least 
depleted in Al (Fig. 59).
Mica K:Rb ratio values for pegmatite samples are presented 
in Figure 60 to enable comparison with published data, with values <20 indicating that the host pegmatites are highly fractionated, more so than Scottish and Red Cross Lake 
rare-metal pegmatites (Fig. 60a). Muscovite at Mt Cattlin showed the lowest K:Rb ratio value (<2.5) and highest Rb 
content (>3 wt%) revealing the host pegmatite to be the most highly fractionated of the muscovite-bearing, WA LCT pegmatites (Fig. 60b). Conversely, muscovite analyses for the 
Londonderry and Sinclair LCT pegmatite suggest these were 
comparatively the least fractionated of the WA pegmatites.
Of the WA lepidolite-bearing, rare-element pegmatites, 
the examples from Greenbushes were the most highly fractionated and were comparable to the extremely 
fractionated Canadian lepidolites, including lepidolite from 
the Tanco Deposit (Fig. 60), which has been described as one of the most highly fractionated LCT pegmatite deposits in the world (e.g. London, 2008 as cited by Bradley et al., 2017). To remove the closure effect that operates when plotting X/Y vs 
Y, which accounts for the highly correlated nature between K 
and Rb, the mica K:Rb vs Cs composition was assessed as an indicator of pegmatite fractionation (Fig. 61).
Changes in the mica K, Rb and Cs composition display a 
well-correlated fractionation trend (Fig. 61) similar to that 
based on the K and Rb composition (Fig. 60). Similarly, Mt 
Cattlin muscovite and Greenbushes lepidolite were the most highly fractionated of the WA pegmatites samples examined, comparable to mica from the highly fractionated Tanco and Red Cross Lake pegmatites (Fig. 61). This demonstrates the 
potential for changes in the mica K, Rb and Cs composition 
to be applied as a valuable exploration tool in assessing the mineralization potential of a pegmatite deposit.
Further discussion of the relative changes in the inferred 
fractionation trends for the different WA pegmatites is given 
in section, Pegmatite mineral fractionation. 0.2

GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western AustraliaMica trace element and REE impurities
Continental crust normalized plots of mica  
(muscovite+lepidolite) trace element composition show highly varied enrichment–depletion trends, with mica from 
WA LCT pegmatites most strongly enriched in Li, Rb, Sn, Cs 
and Ta, and with lesser enrichment in B, Ga and Nb (Fig. 62). Owing to the nature of the mica structure, K can be replaced by Na, Rb, Cs, Ca and Ba (Deer et al., 1992), octahedral Al may 
be substituted by Mg, Fe
2+, Fe3+, Li, Mn, Ti, Cr and V (Deer et 
al., 1992; Li et al., 2021), and Si may be replaced by Al, B, Be 
and Fe3+ (Li et al., 2021). In our case, enrichment in Sn, Ga and 
Nb is likely to occur by the replacement of Al3+ in the mica 
structure (e.g. Li et al., 2021), due to the similar ionic size of Sn
4+ (0.69 Å), Ga3+ (0.62 Å) and Nb5+ (0.64 Å) compared to Al3+ 
at 0.535 Å (e.g. Shannon, 1976).
Box plots for selected trace elements (B, Ga, Nb, Sn, Ta) 
are presented in Figure 63. Overall, these trace elements 
are enriched to similar orders of magnitude with contents 
generally in the range 50–500 ppm, excluding outliers (Fig. 63). Comparable enrichment in Nb (110–258  ppm — Li et al., 2021; to 782 ppm — Shaw et al., 2016), Ta (to 148 ppm 
— Shaw et al., 2016; 15–88  ppm — Li et al., 2021), Ga (to 
224 ppm — Shaw et al., 2016) and Sn (101 ppm — Shaw et al., 2016) was reported for muscovite hosted by rare-metal pegmatites in Scotland (Shaw et al., 2016) and in the Renli Deposit, Hunan, China (Li et al., 2021).
Globally, changes in the mica trace element composition (e.g. 
Figs 62, 63) do not show any regional trends that may enable the identification of individual LCT deposits. However, at the Sinclair Caesium Deposit, marked differences in the B, Nb and Ta enrichment in mica may be attributed to the crystallization 
evolution associated with increasing fraction during cooling of MAW74 20.09.220K:Rb (ratio)

Figure 62.  Continental crust normalized trace element plot for muscovite and lepidolite from selected WA rare-element pegmatites. Mica, as muscovite 
and lepidolite, is most strongly enriched in Li, Rb, Sn, Cs and Ta, with lesser enrichment in B, Ga and Nb. Plots constructed using normalizing 
factors from Wedepohl (1995). Trace element measurement by LA-ICP-MS analysis56
Wells et al.the pegmatite melt. Early crystallization of muscovite results 
in the relative enrichment of Nb, whereas later crystallization 
of lepidolite (e.g. refer to section, Pegmatite mineral 
fractionation) enables the uptake of B and Ta to approximately 
2–3 times the content in muscovite (Fig. 63).
Continental crust normalized plots of the mica REE 
composition show a strong depletion of all REEs across all 
the LCT pegmatites examined (Fig. 64). As is the situation for 
spodumene, it would be interesting to determine if the same depletion trend occurs for other Australian and worldwide LCT pegmatites and, if so, if this may have application as a potential provenance indicator tool for characterizing the LCT 
pegmatite source.
Being enriched in mica, the Cs and Ta composition of 
muscovite has been identified as an exploration tool for identifying potential Ta mineralization in pegmatites (e.g. 
Selway et al., 2005; Shaw et al., 2016). As demonstrated by 
Selway et al. (2005), pegmatite containing muscovite with a Ta 
content >65 ppm and a Cs content >500 ppm is highly likely to host Ta–Nb mineralization.
A plot of the Ta and Cs contents of muscovite in LCT 
pegmatites is presented in Figure 65, compared against the suggested muscovite Ta and Cs contents as indicators of potential Ta mineralization (e.g. Selway et al., 2005). Measured 
Ta and Cs contents of lepidolite were not included as the 
Ta content of lepidolite can be comparable to muscovite, 
whereas the Cs content of lepidolite is significantly enriched 
relative to muscovite. For example, at Kathleen Valley, the Ta 
content of 102 ppm for Mt Mann lepidolite (KVDD0018_#5) 
is comparable to the average Ta content of 82  ppm for Pilgangoora

GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western Australiamuscovite (KVDD0018_#6). In contrast, the Cs content of 
lepidolite in this sample at 2300 ppm is double that measured 
for muscovite at 904 ppm. Similarly, at the Sinclair Caesium 
Deposit, the Cs content of lepidolite (3320–7090  ppm) is ≈8–10 times greater than the Cs content of muscovite 
(300–580  ppm), whereas enrichment of Ta in lepidolite (72–130 ppm) is approximately 2–4 times that in muscovite (31–41 ppm).
Muscovite from LCT pegmatites that plot in the lower 
left quadrant of the Ta vs Cs plot (i.e. Ta <65  ppm and Cs 
<500  ppm) or contain Cs contents <500  ppm are unlikely 
to contain significant Ta mineralization (Fig. 65). Such LCT 
pegmatites include the Sinclair Caesium Deposit, Mt Marion, Londonderry and the Pilgangoora pegmatites. Individually, 
while Ta–Nb oxides were detected in these deposits by TIMA mineral mapping (refer to Appendix 3), Ta–Nb oxides were 
absent or rare to uncommon, occurring as disseminated 
grains, generally <50 µm but up to 200–600 µm in size.At the Dome North Cade pegmatite, the Ta and Cs 
composition of all muscovite examined, bar one sample, does not support the presence of potential Ta mineralization (Fig. 65). This is consistent with the current resource estimate 
(indicated+inferred) of 33 ppm Ta
2O5 for the Cade Deposit 
(Essential Metals, 2021). This is also consistent with the lack 
of columbite–tantalite detected by TIMA mineral mapping in 
drillcore examined from the Cade Deposit. Further indication 
of the relatively poor Ta mineralization at Cade, may be derived 
from the few columbite–tantalite grains that were detected (e.g. Appendix 4). For example, rare columbite–tantalite 
occurred as <50 to 250 µm long laths, with phase composition 
of Nb>Ta and Fe>Mn, as indicated by EDS analysis (refer to 
samples PDRC319_#9-slide #9; PDRC319_#15-slide #12 
and PDRC319_#20-slide #14 in Appendix 4). Despite the poor quality of the EDS signal, the inferred Nb>Ta and Fe>Mn 
compositional trends indicate a ferrocolumbite dominated 
mineralogy (refer to Appendix 4) for a pegmatite melt that has 
undergone limited fractionation. Changes in the columbite–tantalite, Ta:Nb and Mn:Fe composition and their relationship 
to pegmatite fractionation is discussed in more detail in 
section, Tantalum–Niobium geochemistry.
In contrast, the known Ta-bearing LCT pegmatites, such as 
the Greenbushes, Mt Cattlin, Londonderry and Kathleen Valley 
Deposits, all plot in the upper right quadrant, with muscovite 
Ta and Cs contents indicative of Ta mineralization (Fig. 65). 
The exceptions to this were for muscovite from Bald Hill, a 
known Ta producer (refer to the section Bald Hill), and the 
Dome North Cade pegmatite which all contained <500 ppm 
Cs but were variably enriched in Ta (e.g. to 228  ppm Ta at 
Dome North; Fig. 65). A reason for the discrepancy between 
our study and the reported Ta content at Bald Hill may be attributed to pit sampling at Bald Hill not targeting known Ta mineralization at the pegmatite. At the time of our site visit to 
Bald Hill, sampling was restricted to pit exposures only of the 
pegmatite; access to drillcore was limited or not available.
Hence, a more comprehensive characterization of mica 
composition at Bald Hill is required to establish if the Ta 
and Cs composition of muscovite can be established as a 
universal tool for identifying potential Ta mineralization across 
all WA rare-element pegmatites. However, overall, this study 
tends to support the hypotheses of Selway et al. (2005) and 
Shaw et al. (2016) that Cs and Ta enrichment in muscovite is 
a potential indicator of Ta-mineralized pegmatites. A good rule 
of thumb in greenfield exploration would be to consider using 
threshold values of 65 ppm Ta and 500 ppm Cs in muscovite.
Tantalum–niobium geochemistry
Tantalum mineralization in rare-element pegmatites typically 
occurs as columbite–tantalite, ([Mn,Fe][Nb,Ta]2O6 (Bradley et 
al., 2017). Fetherston (2004) provide a detailed description of the characteristics of Ta mineralization associated with mainly 
hard-rock (i.e. pegmatite) occurrences in Western Australia. 
Phase composition and Nb–Ta–Sn–Ti-oxide mineralogy 
can be useful in assessing the degree of fractionation in 
LCT pegmatites (e.g. Shaw et al., 2016). With increasing 
fractionation, columbite–tantalite composition evolves 
through an enrichment of Ta over Nb and Mn over Fe, so that the Ta:Nb and Mn:Fe ratios increase as the pegmatite evolves 
(Bradley et al., 2017).

dominated by Ta, such as ixiolite (Ta,Nb,Sn,Fe,Mn)4O8 and 
wodginite (MnSnTa2O8) (Fetherston, 2004).
Phase distribution characterization by TIMA mapping identified the occurrence of Ta–Nb-bearing phases in several of the rare-element pegmatites examined. Representative examples of Ta-Nb oxides and other exotic phases detected in these deposits is shown in Figure 66, with EDS composition analysis of Ta:Nb-bearing phases detected 
tabulated in Appendix 6. For Mt Marion, Dome North and 
Sinclair Deposits, the quality of the EDS analysis was poor, and so no analysis was possible.
The most common Ta–Nb-bearing phase identified in the 
LCT pegmatites examined in our study was present as a low Ca-bearing (mainly 1–2% but up to 5%), potentially

grain and as vein in-fill within apatite. Tantalite–columbite grains often show Ta enrichment along the grain margins as evidenced by brighter 
BSE contrast, as shown at Mt Cattlin or as compositional zoning that likely occur from changes in Ta:Nb and Mn:Fe ratios during crystal growth 
(Kathleen Valley). Two Ta-mineral series were identified at Greenbushes, comprising a (Sb-free) tantalite–columbite Lseries and a Sb-bearing stibiotantalite (Sbt), which also hosts (Ta-bearing) cassiterite (Cst)

GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western Australialow Tm-bearing, tantalite–columbite solid–solution series 
as typically prismatic or blocky, lath-like crystals (e.g. Fig. 
66; Appendix 6). Notable examples of LCT pegmatite Ta 
mineralization include compositionally complex, acicular 
(to 1000 µm) Nb>Ta oxide at Mt Cattlin, with evidence of Ta enrichment about the grain margin (Fig. 66; slide #18, 
Appendix 4). Similarly, at Kathleen Valley, euhedral tantalite–columbite laths display alternating, dark–light backscattered 
electron (BSE) image contrasts that may indicate changes 
in relative Ta:Nb and/or Mn:Fe ratio during crystallization 
(e.g. Fig. 66).
At Greenbushes, as well as columbite–tantalite, a Sb-
bearing, Mn/Fe-free phase, tentatively identified as 
stibiotantite, of ideal formula SbTaO
4 (Fetherston, 2004) 
was detected both in drillcore (e.g. #241167-slide #17; 241170-slide #21, #241173-slide #24, associated with feldspar) and in pit material (e.g. #C1-200-slide #8, 
Appendix 4). Greenbushes was the only LCT pegmatite examined in the current study where this phase was identified. Stibiotantalite occurs as large (to ≈1  mm), 
irregular, blocky, poikiloblastic grains that host smaller grains of albite, tantalite–columbite and fractured cassiterite (≈200 µm), which may also be Ta-bearing (≈2–
3 wt%) as indicated by EDS analysis (e.g. Fig. 66). Tantalum 
is known to substitute for Sn in cassiterite (e.g. Fetherston, 
2004), but confirmation requires further analysis. As noted 
by Boyle and Jonasson (1984), in pegmatites antimony 
may be concentrated in minerals, such as tantalite–
columbite and stibiotantalite, and related phases. In 
addition, a low Sb–At, high As-bearing oxide, tentatively 
identified as arsenolite, ideally As
2O3, was also detected at 
Greenbushes, occurring as equant grains or as fracture-fill in apatite (#241170; Fig. 66), suggesting a later-stage, re-
mobilization and crystallization of this phase.
At Dalgaranga, a Ta–Nb phase enriched in Ca, and 
potentially Tm-bearing (Appendix 6) was detected 
associated with albite, with a Ta:Nb ratio of 2.24–3.07 
and consistent Ca content averaging 9.95  wt% (e.g. Fig. 
66; Appendix 6; slides #7–8, Appendix 4). This phase 
was initially identified as calciotantite, CaTa
4O11, but did 
not account for the presence of Nb. A check against a published summary of Ta-group minerals, provided by 
Fetherston (2004), indicates this phase is likely microlite, 
part of the Euxenite Group with general formula, ABO
4, 
where A = Y, Er, Ce, La, Nd, Dy, U, Zr, Th, Ca, Fe2+, and B = Nb, 
Ta, Ti, Sn and W. This supports the earlier observation of Hall (1988) that microlite, ideally (Ca,Na)
2(Ta,Nb)2(O,OH,F), 
is the main source of Ta at Dalgaranga. Minerals of this 
group occur in peralkaline granites/syenites, and sub-
ordinately in rare-metal (Li–F) granites and granitic rare-
metal pegmatites (Fetherston, 2004). This is supported by 
the presence of fluorite, CaF2, hosted by massive albite in 
several samples (e.g. DD1-241429, Appendix 4).
The Sinclair Caesium Deposit was generally free or showed 
only trace amounts of Ta–Nb mineralization, which were mostly developed in albite–lepidolite–quartz zones (e.g. 
PDD162_#10 or PDD174_#10, Appendix 3) as single, large 
grains of Fe-free and Ta–Sn–Mn-bearing (Ta>>Nb), as infill 
between lepidolite flakes.
At Dome North, the upper (petalite) zone of the pegmatite 
was free of Ta–Nb oxides. At depth, Ta–Nb oxides 
were rare to uncommon, and where detected, generally comprised columbite–tantalite as rounded laths <50  µm but up to 250 µm long, with Fe>Mn and Nb>>Ta (Appendix 
4). Similarly, at Mt Marion, the few grains of Nb–Ta oxides 
detected consisted of rounded laths, 50–100 µm in size, also with Nb>>Ta and Fe>Mn (Appendix 4). TIMA EDS quality of Ta–Nb oxides detected at Sinclair, Dome North 
and Mt Marion was poor, partly due to their generally small 
grain size, and so no EDS analysis was possible.
In the Mt Mann pegmatite at Kathleen Valley, Ta–Nb oxides 
were generally rare, occurring mainly as small (about 50 µm), irregular grains of calcio–tantite, with Ta>>Nb and trace Mn (e.g. KVDD0018_#3, slide #5, Appendix 4) or as 
sub-20 µm grains of microlite with Ta>>Nb, free of Mn and 
Fe (e.g. KVDD0018_#10, slide #16, Appendix 4). In the high Ta-bearing zone, several (to 600 µm) prismatic tantalite–columbite grains with Ta>>Nb and Mn>Fe (e.g. KVDD0018-
#12, slide #17, Appendix 4) were detected. Similarly, within 
the Kathleen’s Corner pegmatite swarm, Ta–Nb oxides (Mn>>Fe, low Ca, ±Ti) were commonly present as coarse laths, 0.4 – 1 mm, with evidence of compositional zoning reflecting changes in the Ta:Nb and Mn:Fe ratios during 
crystal growth (e.g. KVDD0076_#7, slide #31, Appendix 4; 
Fig. 66).
Changes in the Ta:Nb and Mn:Fe ratios of the tantalite–
columbite solid–solution series composition (Fig. 67) were used as a means of assessing the degree of fractionation 
of the LCT pegmatites (e.g. Shaw et al., 2016). Although 
some caution is necessary because the calculated Ta:Nb and Mn:Fe ratios are based on semi-quantitative EDS analysis, a plot of the Ta:Nb vs Mn:Fe ratios shows that 
the majority of tantalite–columbite analysed are Mn-
enriched (i.e. Mn>Fe) and occupy the middle portion of the manganocolumbite–manganotantalite solid–solution series (Fig. 67). Columbite–tantalite from Kathleen Valley was the most Mn-enriched, with an overall averaged Mn 
content of 10.2 wt% (Appendix 6).

Data are from EDS measurements as tabulated in Appendix 
5. Data excludes the Sn- and Sb-bearing phases detected 
at Greenbushes. The Mn/Fe-free, Ca-microlite identified at 
Dalgaranga (circled) displays a relatively consistent Ta:Nb 
ratio of approximately 0.70 – 0.75. The majority of tantalite–
columbite samples are Mn rich, with Kathleen Valley exhibiting 
the highest Mn contents and generally occupying the middle 
ground of the manganocolumbite–manganotantaite solid–
solution series60
Wells et al.This result is somewhat surprising given that based 
on the mica K, Rb and Cs composition, Greenbushes is 
inferred to present as the most highly fractionated WA 
LCT pegmatite (e.g. Figs 60, 61). It would follow that the 
associated Ta–Nb oxides at Greenbushes would also display a more fractionated nature compared to other 
pegmatites of this study. As noted by Linnen et al. (2012), 
key minerals such as Ta–Nb oxides record but do not 
control the fractionation behaviour of rare elements (e.g. 
Ta, Nb). Changes in the rare-element composition of these key pegmatite phases can vary continuously from 
barren to complexly evolved pegmatites, and in early or 
late assemblages within individual pegmatites (Linnen 
et al., 2012). Other associated phases where Mn and 
Fe are either essential components, such as in garnet  
(Fe-bearing spessartine), or present as impurities (e.g. (F)–apatite, tourmaline, mica) may influence the partitioning of these elements during pegmatite 
crystallization. For example, at Kathleen Valley (e.g. 
slide #26, 31, Appendix 4) and Pilgangoora (e.g. slide 
#36, Appendix 4) Fe-bearing spessartine is a common accessory phase, whereas at Greenbushes garnet was 
absent or only present in trace amounts as very small (<10–50 µm) grains (e.g. slides #6, 24, 26, Appendix 4). Hence, the comparative enrichment of Mn in Ta–Nb 
oxides at Kathleen Valley may not arise through pegmatite fractionation but may reflect a pegmatite melt inherently 
enriched in Mn prior to the onset of crystallization.
Feldspar composition
Albite was the predominant feldspar detected by TIMA 
mineral mapping, hence the majority of EPMA and LA-
ICP-MS analyses presented are for sodic alkali feldspar. 
The compositional range of albite measured by EPMA, expressed as end-member compositions, varied from Ab
94.3 
to Ab99.6 with a maximum orthoclase content of 4.7% (Table 
5). Conversely, the limited analysis of K-feldspar measured 
in WA LCT pegmatites varied from Or91.0 to Or98.2, with a 
maximum albite composition of Ab9.0 (Table 5). The Ca-
feldspar, end-member anorthite was only detected at the Dome North (Cade) and Kathleen Valley LCT pegmatites but limited to <8.0% An (Table 5), with the more calcic albite 
occurring in the Kathleen Corner pegmatite (KVDD0076) 
as compared to examples from the Mt Mann pegmatite 
(KVDD0018) (Table 5).
An Al–Si–Na ternary plot of LCT pegmatite albite identified 
two compositional trends in relation to the expected 
composition for stoichiometric albite (Fig. 68). The first trend is a small increase in the alumina content from 
19.4 wt% (stoichiometric albite) to 20.2 wt% Al
2O3 for albite 
from Dalgaranga and Kathleen Valley at the expense of 
silica (about 67 wt% SiO2 for Dalgaranga and 66.6 wt% SiO2 
for Kathleen Valley) while maintaining a relatively constant 
Na2O content at about 11.6 and 11.5 wt%, respectively 
(Fig. 68). A more significant trend is evidenced by albite from the Londonderry, Mt Cattlin and Greenbushes (pit) pegmatites which show a comparative enrichment in Na
2O 
(to 16.7 wt%, Greenbushes-pit; C3-100/C3-300H-Pink) also at the expense of silica (e.g. 65.2  wt%, Greenbushes-pit) 
while maintaining a near constant alumina content (about 19.1 wt%) relative to stoichiometric albite at 11.8 wt% Na
2O, 
68.7 wt% SiO2 and 19.4 wt% Al2O3 (Fig. 68). Interestingly, 
albite in Greenbushes core (C3DD024) is slightly enriched in silica to about 69.1  wt% compared to 68.7  wt% for 
stoichiometric albite, whereas the albite example from Sinclair shows significant enrichment in silica to about 
72.1 wt% (Fig. 68).
Pegmatite classification
As previously described in section, Nature and types of 
pegmatites, pegmatites (including rare-element types) may be classified into one of five groups on the basis of their trace-
element signatures as reflected by their mineral composition 
(e.g. Černý et al., 2012a). The recent review of LCT pegmatite deposit formation by Bradley et al. (2017) provides a useful summary of the history of pegmatite research and evolution 
of pegmatite classification schemes. The currently accepted 
system of pegmatite classification adapts the earlier scheme of Černý (1991) (refer to section on Nature and types of pegmatites) whereby pegmatite families are identified by 
their diagnostic trace-element composition and pegmatite 
class, which incorporates mineralogy and emplacement depth (Bradley et al., 2017) (Fig. 69).
Pegmatite classification, as well as enabling a means 
of identifying and comparing LCT pegmatite types, importantly informs the most appropriate processing 
route applicable to the pegmatite mineralogical and 
textural characteristics, expected on the basis of its classification. This is extensively discussed in detail in SiO2

behaviour of LCT pegmatites and underpins the basis of a geometallurgical framework for WA LCT pegmatites as described in section, Geometallurgical framework.
Based on this classification scheme, all WA pegmatites 
examined in this study belong to the LCT family of 
pegmatites (Fig. 69), grouped into three sub-types (complex 
spodumene, petalite and lepidolite) and two pegmatite types (albite–spodumene and albite) (Fig. 69). As a comparison, the well-known Tanco (Canada) and Bikita 
(Zimbabwe) pegmatite deposits are also included in the 
classification scheme (Fig. 69). However, compared to WA LCT pegmatites, these are highly zoned and mineralogically 
complex deposits, with Li mineralization hosted by spodumene, petalite and lepidolite, with massive pollucite 
(Cs) mineralization. Until a few years ago, these deposits 
including the Sinclair Caesium Deposit were the only three known sources of economic pollucite.
The following discussion describes the main characteristics 
of each of the WA LCT pegmatites, grouped according to the 
classification scheme.

or ideally as CsAlSi2O6 (Bradley et al., 2017), in trace amounts 
in spodumene sub-type examples from the C1 and C3 pits 
(e.g. C1-100H, C1-100Pink, C3-300White) and as a minor 
phase associated with spodumene, polylithionite and Na/K-
feldspar in an albite–spodumene type example (C1-200) (refer to Appendix 4). Phase-liberation analysis (refer to the section Assessment of physical and chemical processing behaviour 
of LCT pegmatites) detected up to 4–5  wt% pollucite in 
sample C1-200 (refer to section, Liberation characteristics of heavy minerals and pollucite), containing approximately 36  wt% Cs (EDS analysis); stoichiometric pollucite has a Cs content of 42.6  wt% (as CsAlSi
2O6). The conditions of Cs 
mineralization and implications for the crystallization evolution at Greenbushes and for the Sinclair Caesium deposit are 
discussed in more detail in the section Caesium mineralization: 
insight into pegmatite evolution at Greenbushes and Sinclair.
The presence of pollucite was previously reported at 
Greenbushes (Partington et al., 1995), though not described in detail by these authors, and is inferred by Talison Lithium from 
drillhole assay data but is currently considered as uneconomic 
(Husein Al Shakarji, Mine Geologist, written com. August 2020). Economic pollucite mineralization is known only from three locations worldwide: the Bernic Lake Mine or Tanco Mine, 
Manitoba, Canada; the Bikita Mine, Zimbabwe; and the Sinclair 
Caesium Deposit, 125 km south-southeast of Kalgoorlie (e.g. 
Crook et al., 2019).
Mt Marion — Smith and Ross (2017) classify the Mt 
Marion pegmatite swarm as representative of the albite–spodumene type, whereas Jacobson et al. (2007) considers the pegmatites as representative of (predominantly) unzoned 
quartz–spodumene pegmatites. TIMA mineral mapping of the 
ore-concentrate, with a mineralogy comprising predominantly 
of spodumene–quartz–albite with lesser microcline and 
muscovite, supports the classification of Jacobson et 
al. (2007). However, as only a sub-sample, presumably 
representative of the concentrate that was made available 
for characterization, our classification may require further 
confirmation (Fig. 69).

GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western Australia(spodumene-free) muscovite–quartz–albite-type pegmatite 
(e.g. Appendix 4). Within the zone of massive petalite, TIMA 
mineral mapping provides textural evidence of graphic quartz–
spodumene (e.g. Fig. 28) in contact with massive petalite, 
supporting their synchronous crystallization as the pegmatite cooled (Appendix 4).
In the thicker, main pegmatite body at depth as intersected 
by PDRC319 (Fig. 26), minor petalite persists closest to the pegmatite/metasedimentary, hanging wall zone that grades 
into a predominantly feldspar (microcline–albite)–spodumene–
quartz-pegmatite type (e.g. Appendix 4). As the main body of 
the pegmatite comprises spodumene as the principal Li host, 
the Dome North Deposit is classified as a complex spodumene 
sub-type (Fig. 69). The occurrence of petalite and spodumene 
in close association may provide insight into the temperature–
pressure conditions under which the pegmatite crystallized. This is discussed in more detail in section, Pegmatite mineral 
fractionation.
Kathleen Valley — There is limited detailed description of the 
pegmatite mineralogy or textural relationships of the host 
pegmatites at Kathleen Valley. The current classification is based on the examination of discontinuous sections of drillcore 
kindly made available by Liontown Resources.
Lithium mineralization in the Mt Mann pegmatite section 
examined in this study is hosted by both spodumene and 
lepidolite, with the main pegmatite body consisting of 
quartz–spodumene with variably distributed albite and fine-grained, primary lepidolite (e.g. Appendix 4). This classifies 
the pegmatite as a complex spodumene sub-type (e.g. Fig. 69). Similarly, in the pegmatite characterized as part of 
the Kathleen’s Corner swarm, mineralization is hosted by 
quartz–spodumene–albite (±muscovite) (refer to the section 
LCT pegmatites of the goldfields), which also classifies the 
pegmatite as a complex-spodumene sub-type (Fig. 69).
However, the upper and lower margins of the main pegmatite 
body at Mt Mann includes Li hosted by fine-grained lepidolite, 
which imparts a strong purple colour to the pegmatite (e.g. 
Appendix 4). In addition, spodumene in the upper lepidolite 
zone has been altered pseudo-morphically and replaced 
by a secondary mixture mapped as quartz–elbaite–
cleavelandite–calcite–beryl with some relict, primary 
spodumene (Appendix 4). However, XRD analysis of a 
hand-picked, altered spodumene in the upper lepidolite zone 
detected quartz–mica–Li–chlorite with minor laumontite 
and calcite (e.g. Appendix 3). In contrast, lepidolite was not 
detected/mapped in core from Kathleen’s Corner.
The shallow dipping Kathleen’s Corner pegmatite swarm 
and the more steeply dipping Mt Mann pegmatite suite are 
interpreted by Liontown Resources to merge at depth to 
a single pegmatite body (refer to section Kathleen Valley). 
Although this may be possible, the different structural 
aspects of the Mt Mann and Kathleen’s Corner pegmatite 
suites compared to the generally subparallel emplacement of 
pegmatites in other pegmatite swarms, such as Greenbushes, Mt Cattlin, Dome North, Bald Hill and Mt Marion (refer to 
the section Classification and geology of LCT pegmatites in Western Australia) puts this interpretation in question. 
In addition, the occurrence of lepidolite in the Mt Mann 
pegmatite (and its absence at Kathleen’s Corner) suggests 
that the pegmatite bodies are the products of different 
fractional crystallization sequences. Support for our 
interpretation is evidenced by the marked compositional difference of muscovite examined from the different pegmatite swarms, with significant differences in composition 
highlighted in green in Table 6.
Muscovite from the Kathleen’s Corner swarm is comparatively 
enriched in Li, Mg, Fe and F, and is hosted by a more highly 
fractionated pegmatite, as indicated by the larger K:Rb ratio, 
than muscovite from the Mt Mann pegmatite swarm (Table 6). In contrast, muscovite from the Mt Mann pegmatite swarm is relatively enriched in Rb and contains a significantly greater 
Al content (Table 6): muscovite composition for all other 
elements (not highlighted in green) are similar between the two pegmatite swarms.
Complex petalite sub-type
Londonderry — TIMA mineral mapping detected petalite 
as the principal Li-bearing phase at Londonderry, thereby classifying the pegmatite as belonging to the complex 
petalite sub-type (Fig. 69). Out of the main ore zone, the 
pegmatite is described as an albite(–quartz–muscovite) type. Within the main ore zone at Londonderry (e.g. Fig. 36), zones of massive petalite (confirmed by XRD; Appendix 5) 
are interspersed with zones of quartz–mica (muscovite–
trilithionite) (e.g. #233323, #2333330) and zones of 
massive perthitic-textured microcline with exsolved albite 
lamellae (#233328) (Appendix 4). The main petalite zone at Londonderry is essentially free of any accessory or 
exotic phases (e.g. zircon, apatite and garnet) with only a 
few rare zircon grains (30–50 µm) and a single, euhedral columbite–tantalite grain detected in sample #233335. A solitary, 500-µm sized garnet (almandine–spessartine) grain was detected towards the base of the pegmatite in the 
aplite zone (#233338) (Appendix 4, slide #14). Additionally, 
Dittrich et al. (2017) report that until 2017, the Londonderry pegmatite field was the sole Australian locality for which pollucite was recorded.

Wells et al.Complex lepidolite sub-type
Sinclair Caesium Deposit — This deposit was developed 
and mined as a source of Cs until mid-2020. The 
pegmatite core also hosts Li mineralization, as Li–micas 
(lepidolite), petalite, eucryptite and rarer amblygonite 
(Crook et al., 2019). The mineralized pegmatite sequence 
examined in the current study (e.g. refer to the section 
Sinclair Caesium Deposit; Appendix 4) broadly consists 
of a perthitic microcline zone, overlying high-grade 
pollucite which transitions sharply to an underlying albite–
lepidolite–quartz pegmatite (Fig. 19). Petalite occurs 
within the lepidolite zones above and mainly below the 
mineralized Cs zone (e.g. Crook et al., 2019).
Therefore, this deposit can be classified as a complex 
petalite/lepidolite sub-type (Fig. 69), although the existing 
classification scheme does not take into account the 
occurrence of massive Cs mineralization. This may, 
in part, reflect the fact that very few pegmatites host 
economically viable deposits of Cs (e.g. Tanco, Bikita and Sinclair).
Albite–spodumene type
Mt Cattlin  — Regional pegmatite zonation developed at Mt 
Cattlin results in the flat-lying pegmatite being classified as simple (albite or beryl), albite–spodumene (two types 
distinguished on the basis of spodumene crystal size) and 
complex lepidolite types (Fetherston, 2004, p123). The 
albite–spodumene pegmatite type represents the main 
orebody at Mt Cattlin. Hence, Mt Cattlin is classified as 
a Ta-bearing, albite–spodumene type pegmatite (Urgine, 
2016; Fig. 69).
Bald Hill  — Based on the TIMA mineral mapping 
characterization of ore material sampled from the main 
pit at Bald Hill (Appendix 4), the main pegmatite unit 
can be classified as an albite–spodumene type (Fig. 
69). TIMA mineral mapping detected few Ta:Nb-bearing 
phases, which were mainly present as isolated, ~50-µm sized grains of columbite–tantalite and microlite (e.g. 
#BH2250_A/BH2250). Other accessory phases detected 
include sphalerite (to 200  µm), pyrite (to 200  µm), 
cassiterite (<20 µm) and garnet (<20 µm) (e.g. #BH2250, 
#BH1475). Similar to pegmatite collected from Mt Cattlin, 
megacrystic spodumene hosted in a massive albite-
granular quartz matrix is extensively altered, particularly those from the low-grade zone (e.g. Fig. 32; Appendix 4). 
This is discussed in more detail in section, Spodumene morphology and alteration: indicators of pegmatite 
crystallization evolution.
Pilgangoora  — Pegmatites at Pilgangoora can be 
classified into three compositional groups: high-grade, 
quartz-spodumene–albite–microcline (source of alluvial 
Sn); quartz–microcline–albite; and quartz–muscovite–
microcline (e.g. Fig. 69; Jacobson et al., 2007). The 
quasi-homogeneous nature and textural characteristics 
of the Pilgangoora pegmatites that include coarse 
to megacrystic spodumene (e.g. PD001, PD005-all 
samples) and aplitic layering (e.g. PD004-191.88 m) are 
characteristics of albite–spodumene type, LCT pegmatites (e.g. Fig. 41; Sweetapple, 2017).Albite type
Dalgaranga — This is classed as an albite-type pegmatite 
with spodumene+eucryptite as the main Li hosts (Fig. 69). 
TIMA mineral mapping and EDS analysis confirmed the 
presence of microlite as the only Ta-bearing phase detected 
at Dalgaranga in samples examined from drillhole DD1 (refer 
to Appendix 4; e.g. sample #241429, #241437), supporting 
the earlier description by Hall (1988) of Ta principally 
hosted by microlite. The presence of fluorite (associated 
with microlite, e.g. #241429,) and less commonly (F)–
apatite (#241429), along with eucryptite (associated with 
flourite, e.g. #241429) and the secondary, Be-bearing phase 
bavenite, Ca4Be2Al2Si9O26(OH)2, (e.g. #241435, #241437 — 
as confirmed by XRD analysis) probably as a weathering 
product of beryl, infers that Dalgaranga derived from a rare-
metal, flux-bearing (Li–F–Be) granitic melt.
Pegmatite mineral fractionation
District-scale changes in LCT mineralogy and associated 
rare-element geochemistry can define a  broad, concentric 
zonation developed about an inferred or exposed parental 
granite (e.g. Linnen et al., 2012; Bradley et al., 2017 and the references therein). Pegmatites proximal to the source 
granite are the least evolved, consisting only of the typical granitic phases, such as quartz, K-feldspar, Na-plagioclase, 
muscovite and biotite, with accessory garnet, apatite, 
tourmaline and zircon (Bradley et al., 2017). With increasing 
distance from the source granite, the pegmatite melt cools 
further and continues to fractionate so that in distal and 
evolved pegmatites Ta and Li–alumino silicates crystallize 
(Fig. 70), and finally in extremely evolved and most distal 
pegmatites pollucite precipitates (e.g. Bradley et al., 2017), 
as previously described.
Petalite, a Li-bearing phyllosilicate, LiAlSi
4O10, as occurs 
at Londonderry and Dome North, is generally associated 
with highly differentiated LCT pegmatites, forms at lower 
pressure compared to spodumene at the same temperature conditions (Fig. 71; e.g. Linnen et al., 2012). Conversely, 
under the same pressure conditions, petalite forms at higher temperatures than spodumene (Fig. 71). Thus, the 
presence of petalite may be useful as an approximate geobarometer (Bradley et al., 2017). Decreases in 
temperature and pressure following crystallization 
can result in the alteration of either spodumene or 
petalite to eucryptite (Jacobson et al., 2007). Symplectite spodumene–quartz intergrowth (SQI) textures are a 
common feature of LCT pegmatites and result from the replacement of petalite to a mixture of spodumene and 
quartz, under changing (decreasing) P–T conditions  
(e.g. Bradley et al., 2017, London, 2017).
The occurrence of petalite as the principal source of Li 
at Londonderry suggests that the crystallization cooling history occurred at a relatively low pressure, c. <2 kb (e.g. 
Jacobson et al., 2007; Fig. 71). The lack of SQI textures 
in the pegmatite examples examined from Londonderry 
(refer to the section Spodumene morphology and alteration: 
indicators of pegmatite crystallilzation evolution) infer that 
during crystallization, cooling of the melt did not cross the 
spodumene–petalite equilibrium reaction (London, 2017). 
The eucryptite+spodumene association identified in the 
feldspar-rich Dalgaranga pegmatite (refer to Appendix 
4) suggests the late stage, hydrothermal alteration 65
GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western Australiaof spodumene formed eucryptite under reduced P–T  
conditions (Fig. 71; e.g. London, 2017).
At the Dome North Deposit within the upper section of the 
Cade pegmatite intersected by hole PDRC318, the zone of 
massive petalite mineralization displays the typical graphic 
or SQI texture (slide #5, Appendix 4) that can result by the alteration of petalite to a spodumene–quartz mixture 
(London, 2017). During cooling of the pegmatite, P–T  
conditions intersected and continued past the petalite–
spodumene equilibrium reaction, as inferred by the dashed 
blue cooling trend (Fig. 71) enabling alteration of petalite. 
The timing of alteration must have occurred co-incidental 
to final solidification of the pegmatite, which prevented 
petalite alteration going to completion (Fig. 28).
At Greenbushes, mineral textural relationships and 
fluid inclusion studies place P–T  constraints on Li 
mineralization (e.g. Partington et al., 1995; Partington, 2017). In the footwall Li zone, the absence of petalite 
and fluid inclusion work indicate formation of (feldspar-free) quartz–spodumene assemblage at 770  °C and at 
5–5.5 kbars (Partington et al., 1995; Partington, 2017). This places initiation of Li mineralization, not in the spodumene 
stability field as suggested by Partington et al. (1995), but within the virgilite stability field (Fig. 71). Under cooling 
conditions, the melt is inferred to have crossed the virgilite–
spodumene-phase equilibrium at approximately 710 °C and 
transformed to spodumene in the presence of free quartz 
(Fig. 71). In the same way that the alteration of petalite at 
Dome North explains the classic SQI-texture identified in 
this deposit, the development of (near-identical) symplectic 
spodumene–quartz mapped in the C3 pit at Greenbushes 
(e.g. Fig. 12; drillcore and Fig. 13; C3 pit samples) may have 
formed by the alteration of virgilite during cooling of the 
pegmatite melt (Fig. 71).
Based on the fractionation trend derived from changes in 
mica (muscovite+lepidolite), K and Rb composition (Fig. 
60) and taking into account the classification of the rare-
element pegmatites as presented in Figure 69, we can 
begin to develop a comparative ranking of the Western 
Australian rare-element pegmatites (Fig. 72). As based on 
the muscovite K–Rb composition (refer to the section Mica 
composition), Western Australian rare-element pegmatites 
in this study are, in the main, highly fractionated compared 
to other LCT pegmatites worldwide (refer to Fig. 60). Muscovite from the Sinclair Caesium Deposit, with a Rb 
content of <0.6 wt%, associated with the wall rock zone, is the least fractionated of all mica investigated in this study (Fig. 72). The majority of the rare-element pegmatite 
deposits characterized with Rb contents in the range 0.6 – 1.2 wt% may be considered as moderately fractionated 
(Fig. 72).
Muscovite from the Londonderry pegmatite shows a 
degree of fractionation comparative to the majority of 
the pegmatites investigated, but the slightly greater Rb contents (to about 1.8 wt% Rb) support a more fractionated 
system that overlaps into the lower part of the fractionation trend for the Mt Cattlin and Kathleen Valley pegmatites (Fig. 
72). This appears to mark a crossover zone in pegmatite 
fractionation where both muscovite and lepidolite 
host similar Rb contents. As the Rb content increases, 
associated with an implied increase in fractionation of the 
host pegmatite, in the most highly fractionated of WA’s pegmatites (Greenbushes) mica presents as lepidolite,

Wells et al.with Rb contents in the range 3.2 – 4.5 wt% (Fig. 72). This 
suggests a structural limit to the incorporation of Rb within muscovite, with a maximum Rb content of ≈3.2 wt% (Fig. 
72). This is consistent with the very high Rb contents of 
lepidolite from the extremely fractionated Red Cross Lake and Tanco pegmatites (refer to Fig. 60).
However, the occurrence of lepidolite does not necessarily 
infer a high degree of fractionation, as shown by lepidolite 
from the Sinclair Caesium Deposit with Rb contents in the 
range 1.2 – 1.8 wt%, which overlaps with muscovite from the Londonderry, Mt Cattlin and Kathleen Valley pegmatites. Further analysis is required to understand how the pegmatite 
fractionation behaviour is manifested or influences changes 
in mica composition.
As noted by Linnen et al. (2012), key minerals such as 
K-feldspar, Nb–Ta oxides and muscovite record but do not control the fractionation behaviour of rare elements (e.g. Li, Rb, Cs, Ta, Nb). Changes in the rare-element composition of 
these important pegmatite phases can vary continuously 
from barren to complexly evolved pegmatites, and in early or late assemblages within individual pegmatites (Linnen et al., 2012). Hence, fractionation of the crystal melt may not be 
the only process driving the observed mineral compositional 
changes (Linnen et al., 2012). This may be the case for 
the Sinclair pegmatite and help to explain the overlapping fractionation trends recorded by muscovite and lepidolite for Rb contents between 1.2 and 3.2 wt%.Caesium mineralization: insight into 
pegmatite evolution at Greenbushes and Sinclair
Recent detailed characterization of Cs-enriched, LCT 
pegmatites in Zimbabwe and Western Australia, with a  focus 
on the main economic pollucite deposits at Bikita and Tanco, 
established a genetic model for the formation of massive 
pollucite mineralization (Dittrich et al., 2019). According to Dittrich et al. (2019), massive Cs mineralization requires some very specific conditions that enable discrete Cs phases 
(pollucite) to form which bridge the apparent miscibility 
gap between Cs-bearing micas (e.g. muscovite, lepidolite 
and zinnwaldite), with maximum Cs contents of ≈1–2 wt%, and discrete pollucite mineralization, with Cs contents of >~25 wt% (Dittrich et al., 2019). This is discussed in more 
detail in the following section.
As discrete Cs mineralization occurs in only the most 
fractionated rare-element pegmatites (e.g. Bradley et 
al., 2017; Duuring, 2020), the occurrence of pollucite has implications for the fractionation evolution of the Greenbushes pegmatite. In the genetic model proposed 
by Dittrich et al. (2019), initial fractionation of a Cs-bearing 
melt results in the segregation of a proportionally smaller, immiscible melt of composition (Al
2O3+Na2O)>>SiO2 that 
enables the crystallization of analcime, Na(AlSi2O6).H2O. 
Segregation and accumulation of the immiscible analcime melt occurs in the upper part of the pegmatite while 
continuing to be enriched in Cs from the host melt (Dittrich 
et al., 2019). Final crystallization of the pegmatite occurs with formation of massive Ca–analcime, coupled with fluid-controlled Cs enrichment that shifts the composition from 
Ca–analcime to Na–pollucite. Final cooling and late-stage, 
hydrothermal alteration continue the Cs enrichment within 
the massive pollucite mineralization (Dittrich et al., 2019).
At Greenbushes, pollucite was most common in sample 
C1-200, with a mineralogy characterized by predominantly 
coarsely crystalline spodumene–albite (+minor microcline), 
and the near-absence of quartz (Appendix 4). Pollucite 
solubility in granitic melts is strongly dependent on temperature (Linnen et al., 2012). A granitic melt at about 390 °C can be saturated with pollucite at a Cs concentration of ≈4700 ppm (Linnen et al., 2012). Melt composition and 
temperature conditions may have limited Cs enrichment 
in the Greenbushes pegmatite melt, resulting in only minor, localized pollucite crystallization at Greenbushes.
For pegmatite intersected by drillhole PDD179 at Sinclair, 
only one sample examined in the current study provided an 
example of massive pollucite mineralization at this deposit 
(sample #PDD179_7 @47.2 – 47.3  m; refer to Appendix 4, slide #8). From the mineral associations and textural 
features mapped in this example, in comparison to those 
described by Dittrich et al. (2019), an inferred mineralization sequence may be described as:

This inferred mineralization sequence at Sinclair is consistent with a generalized LCT pegmatite sequence 
of mineral formation (Fig. 73) as developed by Dittrich  et  al.  (2019). Textural characteristics revealed by TIMA mineral mapping are also consistent with the genetic 
model for massive Cs mineralization, whereby following 
initial, magmatic controlled crystallization of pollucite, 
cooling of the pegmatite melt to temperatures below 400 °C 
results in the formation of shrinkage cracks and fractures (Dittrich et al., 2019). Below this temperature, the main 
process operating as the pegmatite cools further changes 
to one more consistent with hydrothermal processes. This open network allows the continued circulation of hydrothermal fluids through the pegmatite resulting in further enrichment in Cs of the pollucite mineralization 
via hydrothermally driven alteration. These cracks and 
fractures also provide the sites for late-stage crystallization of lepidolite, quartz and feldspar (Dittrich et al., 2019).
Spodumene morphology and 
alteration: indicators of pegmatite crystallization evolution
Mineral–textural relationships, as characterized in this 
study by detailed TIMA mineral mapping, can provide a useful insight of pegmatite alteration during or following 
crystallization. From the mineralogical and textural 
characteristics of Western Australian rare-element pegmatites examined in the current study, two alteration 
styles were observed to predominate:
•	Pseudo-morphic alteration of spodumene, which is 
replaced by a dark-green to black, fine-grained, Li-mica/
chlorite assemblage that imparts a massive dull, green–
black, waxy-mottled texture (e.g. Fig. 16; Mt Cattlin) or imparts a waxy lustre to the altered crystal (e.g. Fig. 32; Bald Hill). Alteration may either completely (or near completely) replace primary spodumene or is preserved 
as a ‘reaction’ rim about the crystal margin.
•	In situ, graphic-textured (i.e. symplectite), contact 
alteration where spodumene juxtaposes sodic feldspar 
(predominantly albite). Alteration is typically mapped as a 
microscopic, inter-growth of spodumene–quartz–beryl(-elbaite-eucryptite) (e.g. Dome North—#PDRC319_15-
slide#12; Kathleen Valley—KVDD0078_#6, slide #23; 
Pilgangoora—#PD005 @165 m, slide #36, Appendix 3).
Spodumene–cookeite alteration
The first style of alteration is almost exclusively confined to or affects megacrystic (+20 cm sized), tabular and lath-form 
spodumene at Bald Hill and Mt Cattlin (Fig. 16; Mt Cattlin and 
Fig. 32; Bald Hill). In contrast, the second style of alteration is present to varying degrees throughout all the rare-element 
pegmatites examined in the current study, with the exception 
of the Sinclair Caesium Deposit. The extremely coarsely crystalline nature of spodumene at Mt Cattlin and Bald Hill 
may provide insight into the syn-/post-crystallization evolution of pegmatite and of the origin of spodumene alteration at 
these deposits.
Formation of megacrystic to giant crystals (meters in size) 
has been related to the mechanism of constitutional zone refining (CZR) (e.g. London and Morgan, 2012, and the references therein), which can enable very rapid rates of 
crystallization over a surprisingly short period of weeks to 
years (e.g. Bradley et al., 2017; Duuring, 2020). In the CZR process, a well-known metallurgical refining technique, the presence of incompatible components, such as H
2O, B, F, P 
and Be, act as fluxing agents in the rare-element pegmatite melt that can undercool or suppress the melt liquidus temperature by up to 150–200  °C below that normally 
expected for the onset of crystallization (London and Morgan, 
2012). As the melt cools, continued fractionation further 
enriches the fluxing components (and incompatible elements), 
which modifies the melt structure, decreases the melt density and lowers the melt viscosity. The effect is to increase the 
rate of ionic diffusion, which during crystal growth results 
in the development of a flux-enriched, boundary-layer liquid 
at the rapidly progressing crystal front that enables such large crystal sizes to be attained (London and Morgan, 2012; 
Bradley et al., 2017). Thus, the comparatively more coarsely 
crystalline nature of spodumene at Mt Cattlin and Bald Hill 
suggests these pegmatites crystallized from a melt relatively enriched in fluxing agents. This contrasts to the less coarsely 
crystalline nature of spodumene in the remaining LCT 
pegmatites, which suggest these crystallized from a melt low in fluxing components.
As the pegmatite melt cools to <400  °C, the process of 
pegmatite consolidation switches from a process of 
crystallization to one of hydrothermal alteration (e.g. London, 2017; Dittrich et al., 2019). As revealed by TIMA mineral 
mapping, alteration of megacrystic spodumene at Bald 
Hill occurs congruently at the crystal margin and proceeds 
inwards along fractures and spodumene cleavage planes, 
marked by a significant influx of K (Fig. 74) and the removal of nearly all Li (refer to Fig. 51). TIMA mapping also reveals a 
distinct change in the morphology of primary muscovite from coarsely crystalline, subparallel booklets to a finer grained, Figure 73.  A generalized mineralization sequence for LCT pegmatites as

Wells et al.‘disaggregated’ state (Fig. 74). This textural change may define 
a decomposition front developed concentrically about the margin of spodumene alteration as muscovite is progressively 
decomposed as the front moves outward consuming 
muscovite. This provides the source of K that feeds the inward progression of spodumene replacement (Fig. 74).
Though mapped by TIMA as a mixture of lepidolite+ 
phlogopite, XRD analysis confirmed the absence of 
spodumene and the presence of cookeite (Fig. 74). Cookeite 
is a Li-bearing, di-trioctahedral chlorite, with ideal formula (Al
2Li)Al2(AlSi3O10)(OH)8, containing 2.86% Li2O, though small 
amounts of Fe and Mg can replace Li in the octahedral sheet (Bobos et al., 2007). The occurrence of cookeite is 
known in several pegmatite fields worldwide (Bobos et al., 
2007) and has been reported at three Western Australian localities (Lepidolite Hill, Londonderry and Mt Cattlin) (e.g. www.mindat.org/min-1121.html). Cookeite may form 
during the hydrothermal replacement of spodumene and 
other Li–alumino silicates (e.g. petalite, eucryptite and lepidolite), with studies (Bobos et al., 2007) indicating that spodumene–cookeite assemblages in equilibrium with kaolinite±mica±quartz are stable at ≈2.2  kbar and 220  °C, 
with the lower P–T limits of stability for cookeite at 205 °C 
and 2 kbar.
A similar style of alteration was noted in the upper lepidolite 
zone of the main pegmatite body in the Mt Mann suite at Kathleen Valley, where acicular spodumene has been completely, or near-completely, pseudo-morphically replaced by a fine-grained mixture, mapped as ‘quartz–elbaite–
cleavelandite–calcite–beryl’ with some relict spodumene 
(refer to Fig. 41). XRD analysis of a hand-picked, altered crystal of spodumene confirmed the mineralogy of the spodumene alteration as consisting of quartz–cookeite as the major phases, with muscovite/lepidolite, laumontite? (a zeolite) and 
calcite (refer to slide 74#, Appendix 5).
Graphic spodumene alteration
Symplectic spodumene–quartz intergrowth or SQI is the 
textural term used to describe the classic, fine-grained intergrowth texture of spodumene and quartz formed by the 
alteration of petalite (London, 2008; Bradley et al., 2017; Liera 
et al., 2019; Lima and Dias, 2019), as described in the petalite zone of the Dome North Deposit (e.g. see section, Dome North; Fig. 28). Although texturally similar, the microscopic, 
symplectitic quartz–spodumene (graphic) textures, formed 
between Na/K-feldspar and spodumene, as characterized by TIMA mineral mapping of the rare-element pegmatites investigated in this work, did not involve petalite as a precursor phase due to the absence of this phase in the many examples 
where this texture was identified (e.g. Fig. 75).
The graphic textured, SQI developed in the high-grade zone 
example from Bald High (BH1200; Fig. 75a–c) shows the

Wells et al.‘mottled’-like alteration of spodumene as sub-rounded to 
rounded blebs in a zone up to 500  µm wide. Such relic, 
spodumene ‘islands’ decrease in size with distance from 
the spodumene grain margin as they are progressively 
assimilated within albite (Fig. 75c). Similarly, for the coarsely 
crystalline, complex spodumene deeper in the pegmatite 
body at the Dome North Cade Deposit (Fig. 75d–f), the 
interspersed secondary quartz ‘domains’ occur as elongated 
to lobate forms (to 500  µm long). Mapping of the Si 
distribution, in this case, clearly delineates the occurrence 
and form of the spodumene–quartz graphic intergrowth (Fig. 
75f). Other prominent examples of this style of spodumene 
alteration include Mt Marion (slide #4; Appendix 4), Kathleen 
Valley (sample KVDD0076-#7, slide #32; Appendix 4) and 
Pilgangoora (sample PD005, slide #30; Appendix 4).
Modelling the alteration of Li-bearing alumino–silicates and 
their exchange reactions between alkali–feldspars (Wood and William-Jones, 1993) established that with decreasing 
temperature more Li goes into solution at the expense of 
spodumene. This suggests that the symplectic SQIs represent 
a late-stage, re-equilibration or replacement reaction prior to 
final solidification of the pegmatite, which results in the loss 
(leaching) of essentially all Li and Al from spodumene that 
leaves residual Si in the form of secondary, low Al-bearing 
(1–2%) quartz (e.g. Fig. 76; Pilgangoora). ToF-SIMS mapping 
of a symplectic interface between K-feldspar and spodumene 
in the quartz–spodumene pegmatite from Pilgangoora 
highlights the abrupt changes in composition associated with this type of alteration (Fig. 76). Where spodumene is in contact with quartz, this texture type does not form (it 
appears that the end result of the replacement is quartz, so 
that primary quartz acts as a buffer in some way).
Hence, care must be exercised when interpretation of the 
conditions of pegmatite crystallization is based solely on 
mineral–textural considerations. Though superficially very 
similar to the classic SQI texture often described in LCT 
pegmatites (as noted for the Dome North Deposit) formed by 
the alteration of petalite, in this case, the symplectic texture is 
formed by an entirely difference process, that is, the alteration 
of spodumene. In addition, this textural type has implications 
for the processing of such ores where fine-grained intergrowth 
may require finer grinding to more effectively liberate 
spodumene (refer to the section Assessment of physical separation behaviour for a more detailed discussion regarding ore processing).
Trace element associations: vein in-filling
Aside from the above alteration styles characterized in the 
rare-element pegmatites examined, spodumene inherently 
contains inclusions of contaminant phases such as Na/K-
feldspar, quartz, garnet fragments and tourmaline. In addition, 
spodumene universally displays secondary ‘sericitic-like’ 
alteration as microscopic veining, generally not visible to the 
naked eye, controlled by internal fractures and cleavage plane 
surfaces of the pyroxene structure. Lithium-bearing alumino–
silicates are particularly susceptible to alteration compared to 
the bulk of the pegmatite mineralogy (e.g. feldspars and mica), 
in part, because coordination of the Li cation in the octahedral 
site of spodumene is destablized due to the small size of the 
Li ion, which is too small to effectively fill the site (e.g. London, 
2017). This is manifested as a decrease in the Li content 
of spodumene as demonstrated in section, Spodumene 
composition. During cooling, one of the octahedral oxygen atoms rotates away from Li in spodumene, which essentially 
breaks the bond (Cameron et al., 1973).
Secondary alteration veining is predominantly K-rich but 
also introduces other trace element impurities such as Mg, 
Fe and Rb that are ultimately hosted by spodumene. For example, EPMA-wavelength dispersive X-ray spectrometry (WDS) mapping of an alteration veining assemblage 
consisting of a ‘elbaite–phlogopite–lepidolite’, as mapped by 
TIMA, in spodumene from Mt Cattlin, highlights the textural 
variability and compositional complexity associated with 
such alteration (Fig. 77).
Secondary vein alteration is likely to be site specific and may 
not be developed at all deposits. For example, spodumene in some of the Pilgangoora rare-element pegmatites hosts 
extensive, Fe–chlorite (as mapped) veining as shown by TIMA 
mapping in slides #20–21 (Appendix 4). More detailed work 
is required to confirm the mineralogy of this particular vein-
alteration style. However, where it does exist, it will be carried 
through to the final, coarse grind spodumene concentrate. 
This has implications for the calcination processing of 
spodumene where thermal decomposition of secondary (and 
primary) micas can lead to the formation of melts that have 
the potential to limit the amenability of Li to acid leaching. This is discussed more fully in section, Calcination behaviour 
of mineral constituents. 
Spodumene textures: implications for 
pegmatite processing
Mineral–textural associations are key to establishing the most 
appropriate processing strategy (e.g. grinding and recovery route) that accommodates differences in the Li-host phase 
and associated mineralogy. In the current study, spodumene 
is overwhelmingly the major Li-bearing phase, though petalite (e.g. Dome North, Londonderry) and, to a lesser extent, mica 
are also important hosts of Li. The occurrence of megacrystic 
spodumene, as characterized at Mt Cattlin and Bald Hill, is more suited to a (coarse) grind only processing approach, whereas the intimately associated, symplectic SQI, as 
developed at Greenbushes and at Dome North, and the mesh-
textured, acicular spodumene intergrowths as developed at Kathleen Valley (Mt Mann pegmatite), would benefit by a two-
stage process of a coarse–fine grind followed by flotation to 
more effectively recover spodumene. The textural implications 
in relation to establishing the most effective processing workflow are discussed in more detail in section, Calcination behaviour of mineral constituents.
Geochronological characterization
Zircon (and some cassiterite) U–Pb and spodumene/
muscovite 40Ar/39Ar dating was undertaken on several 
LCT pegmatites in order to place age constraints on 
emplacement, crystallization and/or alteration of the host 
pegmatite. Details of the sampling methodology and techniques used are described in Appendix 3, which includes discussion and treatment of the results for individual 
samples. The following discussion considers the application 
of the different dating techniques and what may be inferred 
from the findings.71

GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western Australia(U–Pb) dating
The U–Pb dating results are summarized in Table 7. During 
the course of zircon analysis, some cassiterite grains were inadvertently analysed. The cassiterite was not a 
matrix-match with the primary zircon reference material 
so downhole fractionation between U and Pb could not be accurately modelled during data reduction. However, given the minimum fractionation between Pb isotopes, and 
the age of the samples, a weighted mean 
207Pb/206Pb date 
for cassiterite may still be informative, although should 
be treated with caution. Future matrix-matched dating of 
cassiterite is warranted, with even larger laser-ablation 
spots to accommodate the very low U and Pb contents. In samples dominated by cassiterite, in which little or no zircon was recovered, shaded area in (Table 7),  a weighted mean 
cassiterite 
207Pb–206Pb age is provided in Table 7. Despite 
a zircon age measured for the Kathleen Valley sample, the 
high U contents (6000–9000 ppm, Appendix 3) and high 
mean squared weighted deviation (MSWD) of 6.2 (Table 7), 
does not support a reliable age determination. Hence, the bracketed 
207Pb–206Pb date for this sample (Table 7). 
We filter data for discordance using ((207Pb–206Pb age – 
206Pb/238U age)/ 207Pb–206Pb age)*100. Data with >10% 
discordance are considered to have lost radiogenic-Pb and are not considered further. We use weighted 
mean 
207Pb–206Pb age as this isotopic system has more 
chronometric power for Archean aged material and we 
apply an old primary reference material (OGC-1; (3465.4 
± 0.6 Ma; Stern et al., 2009). Weighted mean 207Pb–206Pb 
ages for samples are given in Table 7 with full data tables 
and weighted mean plots provided in Appendix 3 as a 
supplementary data spreadsheet, with cathodoluminescence 
(CL) transmitted and reflected light images also presented as a supplementary presentation, attached with Appendix 3. Note that imaging data is not presented for samples 
PDRC319 or BH1480 due to the lack of viable analyses nor 
are the associated concordia plots for samples listed in the shaded part of Table 7. This is because of the high (MSWD) (e.g. KD0076) or the U–Pb ages for cassiterite dominated samples were not properly matrix-matched.Zircon U–Pb ages for the Greenbushes, Pilgangoora, 
Dalgaranga, Bald Hill and Londonderry pegmatites overlap 
within uncertainty (Table 7). Comparable ages were also established for other LCT pegmatites not included in the current study, such as the Mt Deans pegmatite (Dittrich et al., 2019). However, the chemistry and form of most 
zircon analysed in this work suggests they are inherited 
grains, not crystallized in the pegmatite. The relatively low-U content (<<500 ppm and usually <100 ppm) in the analysed zircon from these samples, and their relatively small size 
(predominantly ≤100 µm but in cases up to 200 µm) suggest 
that they are not pegmatitic zircon. If these ages reflect the age of the pegmatite host, it follows that they provide a maximum constraint on pegmatite crystallization (i.e. the pegmatite must be younger than the host). It should 
be noted that these ages broadly coincide with a major 
period of global pegmatite emplacement at 2650–2600 Ma (Bradley et al., 2017; Dittrich et al., 2019). Peak periods of pegmatite emplacement are considered to correlate with 
increased crustal magmatism, associated with cycles 
of supercontinent break-up and formation (e.g. Bradley et al, 2017). In the Yilgarn, the 2650–2600 Ma interval correlates with the formation of low-Ca granitoid melts also accompanied with the intrusion of mantle derived, adakitic 
granitoids (Dittrich et al., 2019).
While the cassiterite ages should be viewed with caution 
as indicated above, we note that the Pb–Pb ages for C1-100_Pink and PD005 are significantly younger than those obtained on the inherited zircon from the pegmatites. Future 
matrix-matched analysis using larger spots would confirm 
this and provide a further indication of whether cassiterite yields a pegmatitic crystallization age.
The Greenbushes inherited zircon date of 2631 ± 4 Ma is 
significantly older than the age of three pegmatites dated 
at 2527 ± 2  Ma as previously reported by Partington and 
colleagues (1995). The Logue Brook Granite, dated at 2612 ± 5 Ma (Compston et al., 1986), was proposed as the source of the pegmatite but a genetic link with the granitoid is considered unlikely due to the age disparity (Partington et al., 
1995). The revised zircon age obtained in the current study

Wells et al.still suggests that they are not temporally linked, although a 
review of Logue Brook samples may be warranted.
A weighted mean U–Pb age of 2643 ± 10  Ma was 
determined from four concordant zircon grains from the 
Bald Hill site (refer to Appendix 3). The younger age of these 
grains is consistent with the older age determined for the Mount Belchers formation (MBF) at 2666 ± 5 Ma, which hosts the pegmatite (refer to the section Bald Hill). 
40Ar/39Ar analysis: spodumene and muscovite
40Ar/39Ar geochronology was attempted on spodumene 
separated from the Bald Hill, Pilgangoora and Mt Cattlin LCT pegmatites (Fig. 78). The analytical results for the 
Mt Cattlin MC1700 sample generated a robust inverse 
isochron corrected plateau date of ~1.1 Ga, however the Pilgangoora and Bald Hill results are highly uncertain due to excess radiogenic argon (Fig. 78 inset). The corrected 
plateau dates ~0.6 - 1.3 Ga and ~0.8 - 1.3 Ga respectively, 
are open to interpretation. Collectively, they likely represent post-emplacement fluid alteration events. 
An alternative argon geochronology approach involved the 
analysis of muscovite separates from the Bald Hill and Mount Cattlin samples (Fig. 79). An aliquot of Mount Cattlin 
muscovite, along with a replicate, did not return statistically 
significant plateau dates although total fusion error ages of 2.4 Ga and 2.6 Ga (Fig. 79a). Two separate aliquots of Bald Hill muscovite, however, did return statistically significant 
muscovite plateau ages of 2602.5 ± 2.75 Ma and 2605.2 ± 
1.99 Ma (Fig. 79b). These ages are interpreted as a regional cooling age through the closure temperature of the argon system in muscovite. Comparing the Bald Hill muscovite 
40Ar/39Ar ages to the zircon U¬-Pb age (2643 Ma ± 10 
Ma) indicates that post-emplacement cooling to closure temperature of the Ar-isotope system took ~40 million years.
Given the disparate results between spodumene and 
muscovite ages, and the observation of pervasive 
microscopic scale spodumene alteration as described in section, spodumene morphology and alteration: indicators of pegmatite crystallization evolution, we infer that the 
radiogenic argon measured during spodumene analysis was 
predominantly contributed from the sericite alteration zones. Accordingly, the spodumene argon dates likely reflect a late-stage hydrous alteration event.
It is highly recommended that follow-up dating of known 
mafic dykes at Mt Cattlin (and at Bald Hill) and further dating 
of spodumene alteration at both pegmatites (and at other Western Australian pegmatite deposits) be undertaken to provide a relative age constraint on the timing of dyke emplacement and to test whether mafic dyke intrusion led 
to the alteration observed at these pegmatites.75

Wells et al.Quantitative assessment of 
pegmatite minerals by LIBS 
analysis method
The application of LIBS was tested as an independent 
assessment of the practical limitations and requirements in exploration and mining operations focused on LCT 
pegmatites. This section provides a brief explanatory 
background of the technique and of the advantages and 
disadvantages as applied to the quantitative analysis of 
Li(spodumene)-bearing pegmatites. In summary, the main 
findings of this work were:
•	Quantification of pegmatite Li and associated element 
(Al, Si, Fe, K, Mg) contents was assessed by application of partial least squares (PLS) analysis of LIBS analysis of 
representative powders of known (XRF) composition.
•	Calibration PLS cross-validation (CV) models were 
developed from a standard data set of 37 pegmatite 
samples with four samples chosen as unknown 
validation samples.
Predicted PLS CV models of the pegmatite Li, Si and Al content 
in the validation data set were close to the known Li, Si and Al 
contents with relative percentage errors of mainly <12%.
•	However, Li content of the four validation samples could 
not be consistently predicted.
•	Similarly, modelled contents of the Fe, K and Mg content 
were not reliably predicted.
The LIBS technique is known to suffer from a few inherent, sample-related effects. The robustness and precision of PLS-LIBS quantification would be improved by developing CV-calibration models from a larger, more extensive sample 
set and by paying close attention to more consistent sample 
preparation to minimize sample surface (granularity, textural) 
and chemical matrix effects.
It is recommended that the existing calibration sample set be 
expanded to include a minimum of 200–250 representative examples from all significant WA LCT pegmatites to ensure the range of sample compositional variability is accounted 
by the prediction models.
LIBS methodology
LIBS is a relatively recent technique finding increasing 
application as a geoanalytical tool. Some recent applications 
include gold analysis and quantification (e.g. Harhira et al., 
2017), gemstone (e.g. McMillan et al., 2014) and garnet (e.g. Alvey et al., 2010) provenance discrimination, and a range of applications for mineral analysis (e.g. McMillan et al., 2007; Harmon et al., 2013). A LIBS system has been adapted for 
use on board NASA’s Curiosity Rover, as the ‘ChemCam’ 
system for distal compositional analysis of Martian soil and rock exposures (e.g. https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/spacecraft/instruments/chemcam/ ).
The LIBS technique employs a nano-second, pulsed laser to ablate a 20–100 µm diameter spot of the sample surface being investigated, thereby vaporizing approximately 
1  ng of material to form a localized, high temperature (5000–20 000 K) plasma plume (e.g. McMillan et al., 2014). 
As the plasma cools, electron decay from excited energy levels to their ground state condition emits characteristic element emission lines typically over the 200–1000 nm wavelength range (e.g. McMillan et al., 2014). The emitted 
light is collected and transmitted through optical fibres and 
the polychromatic radiation is dispersed in one or more diffraction gratings and recorded using a charged-couple device or CCD (e.g. McMillan et al., 2014).
LIBS instruments are available in a wide range of 
configurations with several hand-held, field portable 
systems (e.g. Bruker, Hitachi and SciApp) available to enable geochemical analysis to be performed at mine or pit faces or be included as part of a core logging campaign. Available LIBS instrumentation can measure and collect 
both quantitative, multi-element analysis of samples as 
well as surface, elemental distribution maps, typically of 2  mm x 2  mm areas to characterize the distribution and mineral-element correlation of geological material. 
A major advantage of the technique is that LIBS enables 
the simultaneous detection and quantitative analysis of all elements in the periodic table, particularly the emission lines of light elements (Z<10) such as B, Be and Li  
(e.g. Sweetapple and Tassios, 2015).
Early studies demonstrated the potential of LIBS for phase 
identification (e.g. McMillan et al., 2007) and for quantitative analysis of Li in Li-bearing phases, such as spodumene, petalite and eucryptite, associated with LCT pegmatites (e.g. Fabre et al., 2002). More recent LIBS applications as 
a means of Li quantification have met with mixed success, 
with relative errors of up to 20% reported for Li contents measured using LIBS compared to results from EPMA and LA-ICP-MS techniques (e.g. Rossi et al., 2014; Sweetapple 
and Tassios, 2015).
As summarized by Sweetapple and Tassios (2015), the 
precision of LIBS measurements can be affected by instrumental factors relating to spectrometer calibration and plasma effects (e.g. self-absorption) that may induce peak broadening. Despite the significant advantages of 
the LIBS technique, such as enabling the rapid (real-time) 
analysis of a high sample volume throughput and requiring little to no sample preparation, the LIBS technique suffers from a few inherent, sample-related effects, such as the 
condition of the sample surface (granularity, surface texture 
and density) and chemical (element concentration) matrix effects (Sweetapple and Tassios, 2015). As noted throughout our investigation, spodumene rarely occurs in a pristine, unaltered condition and almost universally displays some 
level of fine-scale alteration, often not visible to the naked 
eye (e.g. refer to the section Spodumene morphology and alteration: indicators of pegmatite crystallization evolution).
Sample selection for mineral standards
To test the application of field portable LIBS for quantitative compositional analysis, well characterized mineral samples were selected for use as calibration and validation samples. 
Pressed-powder discs of pulped standards were then made 
to generate calibration curves using samples with known composition. 77
GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western AustraliaLaser-induced breakdown 
spectroscopy: application for field quantification of pegmatite composition
LIBS quantification of LCT pegmatite 
composition
To overcome issues related to sample heterogeneity and 
surface textural or granularity effects, a pilot study using material pulverized for XRF analysis was undertaken to 
assess the application of LIBS analysis for quantitative 
geochemical analysis of a suite of LCT pegmatite samples (Table 3.5, Appendix 3). For the sample series being tested, a LIBS spectrum of a pressed powder ‘biscuit’ of 
spodumene from Mt Cattlin (#MC300) is presented in 
Figure 80. It is interesting to note the detection of emission lines for K and Na (Fig. 80) and other elements present in trace amounts, given the widespread development of fine-scale alteration as previously described for this 
sample (e.g. refer to section, Spodumene morphology 
and alteration: indicators of pegmatite crystallization 
evolution). Use of an aliquot of the XRF sample pulp 
has the advantage of ensuring a coherent and well 
characterized data set is used as a means of validating the 
LIBS compositional analysis against the XRF geochemical results through application of multi-variate, PLS analysis. Refer to Appendix 3 for details of the PLS method and 
development of LIBS spectral calibration models.
Cross-validation models as plots of the CV-predicted 
component (i.e. element content) against the known weight percent element concentration for Li, Si, Al and Fe are shown in Figure 81. Cross-validation models for other elements, including Mn, K and Mg, were developed but were less 
successful (data not shown). Predicted (r
2) values of the 
Si, Al and Li contents are strongly correlated to the known 
concentration of these elements, although standard error 
of prediction (SEP) values for Al (1.25%) and Si (1.46%) may 
be considered high (Fig. 81). Sample points from which the CV calibration models were produced are coloured by the F-Parameter, with red data points sitting outside (i.e. the 
green shaded region in each case) the F-Parameter cut-off 
value of 0.9 (Fig. 81). The F-Parameter value gives a measure of the size of the residual, defined as:
F-Parameter = (known concentration – predicted 
concentration)
2
for the element in question for each sample. This provides a means of identifying possible outlier samples, and the calibration models could benefit by further refinement to 
assess if these samples could indeed be excluded from the 
calibration model.
The CV-predicted element concentrations, derived by 
applying the PLS calibration models for each element, were compared against the known (i.e. XRF assay) concentration 
for Li, Si, Al, Fe, K and Mg (Table 8). The CV-predicted 
contents of Li, Si and Al were close to the known Li, Si and Al contents of the validation samples, with percentage relative errors mostly <≈12%. Estimates of the silica 
content for the unknown samples were the most reliably 
predicted compared to their known SiO
2 contents (Table 8). 
However, estimates of the CV-predicted Li content for two of the validation samples were significantly underestimated compared to the known Li contents in these cases (Table 8). Relative errors of the CV-predicted Fe, K and Mg contents were significant and did not show a consistent 
trend in either their over or under estimation compared to 
the known Fe, K or Mg contents for the validation samples (Table 8).
Reasons for the discrepancy between the CV-predicted 
and known element concentrations are unknown but likely 
are related to sample physical and chemical effects (e.g. 
Sweetapple and Tassios, 2015). During LIBS measurement, it was noted there were differences in the competency of the compressed ‘biscuit’ surface, causing the laser to couple inconsistently during ablation (i.e. greater 
shot-to-shot variability). In some instances, during LIBS 
measurement laser shots explosively ejected material from the sample surface. Hence, there would be insufficient energy transfer to generate the plasma plume. In situations 
where this occurred, sample LIBS measurements were not 
included in the CV modelling.
In addition, the inclusion of near mono-mineralic samples 
with more typically mixed-phase samples (i.e. drillcore — Table 3.5, Appendix 3) would induce matrix-matching effects with some samples predominantly comprising 
a single phase compared to the typical multiphase 
mineralogy of a rare-element pegmatite, where mineral proportions can vary. Self-absorption effects can also be important. For example, emission lines of Li and Na can 
be affected by self-absorption, which can induce peak 
broadening and a reduction in peak intensity (e.g. Rossi et al., 2014; Sweetapple and Tassios, 2015). Finally, CV prediction and PLS model robustness would be improved by including a much larger and more extensive sample 
suite in the study by incorporating LCT pegmatite examples 
from other rare-element deposits but still pay close attention to a more consistent matrix matching between samples.Figure 80.  LIB S spectrum for Mt Cattlin spodumene (MC300) over the

GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western AustraliaAssessment of physical and 
chemical processing behaviour of 
LCT pegmatites
The metallurgical response of different pegmatite ores was 
evaluated in terms of:
•	Mineral liberation characteristics for beneficiation 
properties
•	Thermal behaviour and lithium extractability associated 
with conventional calcination and sulphate roasting 
refining for recovering Li.
Assessment of physical separation 
behaviour
An understanding of the liberation characteristics or 
particle composition distribution of an ore is important in 
comminution circuit design and for optimizing beneficiation 
processes, such as flotation, density, and magnetic and 
electrostatic separation in operating plants.
Key findings
Key findings observed in this work are as follows:
•	Twenty-one samples that represent different deposits 
and lithologies from Mt Cattlin, Bald Hill, Greenbushes and Pilgangoora regions were examined. The main 
source of lithium is spodumene in these deposits, with regions containing Li micas (lepidolite and zinnwaldite) 
and petalite. 
•	Generally, the coarse nature of spodumene within quartz, 
feldspar and muscovite mineral matrix allows for >90% 
recovery of spodumene, with expected Li grades above 
3 wt%. 
•	Factors identified that limit recovery and grade are 
regions with:o Graphic-textured, spodumene–quartz alteration 
intergrowth between spodumene and K/Na-feldspar, 
as observed in most samples but extensively in 
samples elevated from Pilgangoora
o Partially altered spodumene containing micas in fine interstitial veins in voids and fractures and as 
inclusions within spodumene grains. This is prevalent 
at both Mt Cattlin and Bald Hill where high grade, white 
spodumene in quartz, feldspar and muscovite zones 
transitions to low grade, highly altered green to dark-
green spodumene
o Separation of middlings containing high mica and/
or quartz/feldspar contents and finer grinding 
would improve the recovery of spodumene in these 
orebodies
o In Greenbushes samples, spodumene can be well liberated from the main gangue mineral quartz, with 
high recovery and Li grades of 3.5 wt%. Fine grinding 
would be required to liberate spodumene associated 
with graphitic texture intergrowths with quartz and, in 
some areas, with feldspars.
•	Tantalum minerals in all deposits examined are mainly 
associated with the gangue minerals or are freely 
liberated under the particle sizes examined in this study. 
Hence, Ta minerals can be upgraded and concentrated 
separately from spodumene, as is practised by industry.
•	At Greenbushes, antimony and arsenic are present as 
stibiomicrolite and parabrandtite, respectively, as finely disseminated grains within spodumene. There are also 
associations of pollucite with spodumene.
•	A high percentage of cassiterite in most samples 
are locked and associated with spodumene and, therefore, will report along with spodumene grains in the 
concentrate.
•	Analysis of the liberation characteristics of spodumene 
concentrates collected from the beneficiation circuits at 
five mines reveal high contamination content of gangue 
mineral, up to 20  wt%. Of this only around 5  wt% is 
associated and locked with spodumene. Techniques such 
as ore sorting can be used to reduce mineral impurities to 
the beneficiation circuit.Table 8.  Comparis on of PLS-predicted and known-element concentrations for Li, Si, Al, Fe, K and Mg in the validation samples

Wells et al.Sample selection and methodology
The samples examined in this study were from Pilgangoora, 
Bald Hill, Mt Cattlin and Greenbushes regions. Budget constraints limited the evaluation to these four areas. 
Samples which represent different deposits and lithologies 
were selected and are outlined in Table 9.
In addition, five concentrates produced from the 
beneficiation circuits of five mine sites were examined. These are discussed in section, Liberation characteristics-
concentrates. Figure 82 outlines the procedure used 
for sample preparation and analysing mineral liberation 
properties.The selected samples were crushed to pass 3.5  cm using a jaw crusher. Sub-samples were then subjected 
to electrodynamic fragmentation and screened to pass 
–4 mm. The particle size was chosen to allow comparisons between samples and not to optimize comminution. The electrodynamic fragmentation technique allows for detailed studies of the original morphology and shape, crystal 
structure, physical and textural features, and the chemical 
composition of mineral phases without the damaging effects associated with sample preparation by crushing. Sub-sampling was carried out using a rotating splitter technique 
to ensure representative samples were obtained for detailed 
mineralogical and metallurgical test work.

GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western AustraliaElectro-fragmented samples were sieved to yield six size 
distributions (between +2000 µm and –75 µm) and prepared for mineralogical analyses. Polished sections of the sized 
fractions were produced and studied to determine the 
relationship of Li-bearing silicates liberated from gangue minerals. Figure 83 shows the particle size distribution following electrodynamic fragmentation where a large 
percentage of the material resides in the coarse fraction 
with minimal fines produced. Between 60 and 80% of particles were greater than 1 mm in size. All samples have a similar particle distribution, except two from Greenbushes, which are associated with high and low quartz content. 
Electrodynamic fragmentation and screening to pass –4 mm 
reduced the formation of fine particles.
Optical imaging and automated digital imaging assessment 
of the different size fractions was carried out on polished mounts to determine the modal mineralogy, mineral textures 
and liberation characteristics of lithium ore samples using 
TIMA. The deportment of the major elements was also assessed. Using the mineralogical liberation analysis routines within TIMA software, the mineral particles within the polished mounts were categorized in terms of:
•	Mineral locking properties , which are used to describe 
how much free surface of a given mineral is exposed, 
and the type and number of minerals that are intergrown with it
•	Mineral liberation characteristics  based on the distribution 
of Li-bearing minerals across particle composition 
classes (locked, middling and liberated) for both bulk 
composition (volume mineral liberation) and surface composition of particles (surface mineral liberation) analysis
•	Theoretical grade–recovery curves developed to provide 
an estimate of the maximum expected recovery that 
can be achieved by physical separation of a mineral at a given grade. Test work is always required to validate the results.
A comparison between samples and their influence on 
beneficiation properties was then evaluated.

Wells et al.Assessment of mineral content
The mineralogical composition acquired from TIMA 
liberation analysis for samples selected from the four mine sites are shown in Table 10. The mineral mass of a phase is 
calculated based on percentage area in polished sectioned 
mounts using an assumed density for each mineral.
In all samples analysed, the main Li-bearing mineral is 
spodumene, with minor amounts of eucryptite, petalite and lepidolite. The main gangue minerals are feldspars, quartz 
and micas. The main feldspar tends to be the Na-rich form, 
albite, with K-rich feldspar more abundant in some Bald Hill 
and Pilgangoora samples. Chlorite and phlogopite micas rich in Fe, Mg and Mn are associated with both Mt Cattlin and Bald Hill samples. Apatite, tourmaline and beryl appear 
in most samples. Pollucite is present as a minor phase 
in the Greenbushes samples, except in C1200, where it is more abundant. Calcite is present in most samples in trace amounts but occurs in slightly higher concentration 
in some of the Bald Hill and Pilgangoora samples. Tin in the 
form of cassiterite and Ta in form of tantalite are present in trace amounts. Lepidolite and muscovite, although present in all samples, are more abundant in the Greenbushes and Pilgangoora samples.The accuracy and consistency of the derived data calculated 
by TIMA was compared with the whole rock bulk chemistry 
and the results are shown in Figure 84 and Table 11. An R
2 
value is presented for each sample. This value describes the deviation of the results from a perfectly linear relationship 
(R
2 = 1). The minerals in the mineral classification file used 
to classify which phases in the polished mounts have fixed, 
average chemical compositions. Both MC500 and MC600 
contain highly altered spodumene with varied compositions 
that may account for some variation in values. Overall, the data are in excellent agreement and provide confidence in the results.
The abundance of spodumene and gangue minerals in the 
different size fractions in the Pilgangoora, Bald Hill, Mt Cattlin 
and Greenbushes samples are shown in Appendix 7. The majority of the spodumene in most samples examined occur in the coarse fractions, with the fine fractions containing higher gangue mineral content. The coarse nature of 
spodumene within the ore reflect its association with the 
coarse particle size. Depending upon the nature of the minerals associated with spodumene, high-residual contents of micas, feldspars and quartz occur in the coarse fractions.

GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western AustraliaDeportment of lithium and major elements 
The deportment of the main elements that impact the lithium 
extraction and recovery process efficiency (Li, Fe, Mg, Mn, 
Na, K, Cs, Ca, P , Rb, Ta, F) were calculated by evaluating the 
laser-ablation data and relating the measured concentrations 
in discrete minerals to the derived TIMA modal abundance 
of the minerals in the sample. It is important to track and limit the amount of Fe and alkaline metals reporting to the 
concentrate during beneficiation, as they can cause clinker 
formation and slagging issues in the downstream calcination 
process (Harman, 2019). 
Figure 85 shows the deportment of lithium in the Pilgangoora, 
Bald Hill, Mt Cattlin and Greenbushes samples. The deportment of other major elements in the samples are shown in Appendix 8.
Lithium is predominantly associated with spodumene in most 
samples analysed. In Pilgangoora, minor amounts are also 
associated with lithian muscovite and lepidolite. At Bald Hill, 
in regions of the deposit containing more altered mineralogy, some Li is associated with the phosphate mineral sicklerite, 
Li(MnFe)PO
4, and in a sample rich in beryl. Minor amounts of 
Li also exist in lepidolite grains and chlorite minerals. At Mt Cattlin, Li is also contained in lepidolite in some regions of the orebody.
In Pilgangoora samples, the Fe content is mainly associated 
with muscovite (2.4 wt%) and in spodumene (0.58 wt%). 
Sodium is predominantly in the mineral albite. Potassium 
and Rb are associated with microcline and micas, whereas Ca is associated with calcite (PIL3) and some feldspars. The high content of Rb (1 wt%) in some of the feldspars would 
make the K-feldspar a potential source of Rb. Manganese 
is associated mainly with spessartine and with moderate amounts in Li minerals (0.15 wt%). Phosphorus is associated with minor mineral apatite. Caesium and F are mainly 
associated with Li micas, although there are traces in feldspar 
minerals and beryl. Magnesium is present mainly in one 
sample (PD008) associated with biotite and chlorite minerals. 
At Bald Hill, most of the Fe content is associated with the 
micaceous chlorite (~1.68  wt%) phases and the mineral 
sicklerite in sample BH1480. Only trace amounts of Fe appear 
in the spodumene (~0.04 wt%). Manganese and P is rich in sicklerite grains, as observed in sample BH1480. Potassium, along with Rb, is associated with microcline, Fe–Mg rich 
micas and muscovite. Caesium appears mainly limited to 
beryl. Sodium is largely associated with albite present in all 
samples. Calcium is associated with albite and apatite grains. 
Fluorine is present mainly in apatite grains and muscovite. 
In Mt Cattlin samples, a strong association of Fe (016 wt%), 
Mn (0.1  wt%) and Mg (trace) occurs with spodumene in 
these samples due to the high content of micas containing Mg, Fe. Manganese, K, Cs, Rb and F are associated with lepidolite found mainly in sample MC1700. Sodium is 
associated with albite. Calcium is associated mainly with 
feldspars and apatite although small quantities of Ca are also associated with calcite. Phosphorus is associated with apatite in all samples. Tantalum in the form of tantalite exists 
in trace amounts in most samples but is more abundant in 
the lepidolite-enriched sample.
In Greenbushes, only trace amounts of Fe (0.17 wt%), Mg 
(0.02 wt%), Ca (trace) and Mn (0.07 wt%) are associated with 
spodumene. Muscovite and tourmaline are minor minerals containing Fe, Mg and Mn. Sample C1200 contains Cs 
associated with the mineral pollucite, which is discussed in 
more detail in later section. Sodium and K are associated with feldspar minerals which are more abundant in sample C3100. Rubidium is associated with micas (4 wt%) and microcline (0.16 wt%) especially in sample C3100. Fluorine 
is predominantly associated with mica. Tantalum in the form Greenbushes Pilgangoora

Wells et al.of tantalite and stibiomicrolite (Sb-bearing oxide mineral) is 
associated mainly with samples taken from the Central lode 
region of the mine. 
Iron is also present in Ta–Nb oxides and garnet (mainly as 
spessartine) as well as the micas, Fe–chlorite (as locally 
developed at Pilgangoora). Manganese is present in Ta–Nb oxides, garnet (as spessartine) and apatite (nearly all F–apatite is Mn-bearing, 2–6%; as well as the Mn-phosphate, 
beusite at Mt Cattlin).
Overall, all spodumene samples contain Fe and Mn, which 
will report along with spodumene in concentrates as discussed later. The high Fe and Mg, K contents of the micas, largely associated with Bald Hill and Mt Cattlin 
samples, will need to be limited. Apatite appears present in 
many of the samples. Although apatite appears as a trace mineral, it will need to be limited in concentrates to prevent accumulation of phosphate in downstream processing. Where present, calcite is a minor phase in samples and is 
unlikely to cause problems in refining of concentrates to 
extract lithium.
Liberation characteristics of spodumene 
Figures 86 to 95 show representative mineral composition maps of all samples in the polished mounts for the +500 μm fractions, together with liberation distribution data for 
spodumene.
Pilgangoora samples
All samples are abundant in spodumene with many 
particles low in other mineral inclusions, even within the coarse size fractions (Figs 86–89). All samples exhibit 
grains with fine intergrowths of quartz, feldspar and 
spodumene. The intergrowths range in size from 5 to 50  µm. In PIL1 some of the spodumene particles have undergone alteration with spodumene being replaced 
by micaceous minerals, such as muscovite, lepidolite 
and trilithionite, as well as occurring with calcite. These alterations occur along margins and fractures, and form aggregates or veinlets of mixed assemblages. The measured particle-composition distribution or liberation 
characteristics reveal around between 10 and 20% of 
the spodumene particles contain gangue minerals of quartz, feldspar and some muscovite. While spodumene appears readily liberated from coarse quartz and feldspar 
mineralization, between 10 and 20% of the spodumene 
particles contain quartz–spodumene, graphitic textured regions. To separate quartz from spodumene in these graphitic textures would require grinding and separation at a finer grain size (<250 µm). The micaceous rich sample 
(PIL1) would also require finer grinding down to <75 µm to 
liberate the micas and calcite from spodumene. Overall, it would be expected that some feldspar and quartz will be carried and reported to the concentrate for treatment 
downstream. In some samples muscovite (not Li-bearing) 
also reports with spodumene in the concentrate. While not tested in this work, similar liberation characteristics may be expected in high-grade ores from Mt Marion and Kathleen Valley, which also exhibit fine intergrowths of 
quartz, feldspar and spodumene features in regions (e.g. 
refer to Appendix 4).Bald Hill samples
Mineral composition maps of samples that represent zones from unaltered spodumene through to parts of the post-crystallization, alteration regions are shown in Figures 90 
and 91. In the Bald Hill samples, many of the spodumene 
grains are liberated from the main gangue minerals and range from 90% for mainly high grade, unaltered spodumene (BH1300) to 17% in low grade, altered spodumene 
samples (BH2700). However, in all samples a proportion 
of spodumene grains contain networks of fine micaceous inclusions associated with spodumene, from zones within the orebody that have undergone post-crystallization alteration. The samples contain between 10% and 30% 
micas locked within spodumene particles and are present 
in all size fractions evaluated. In the areas where post-crystallization alteration is prominent, ultrafine grinding will be essential to liberate unaltered spodumene if these ores 
are to be treated for lithium extraction. In sample BH2700, 
beryl is well liberated and can be separated from spodumene by gravity or dense media separation (DMS) techniques. Overall, while spodumene is readily liberated from quartz, feldspar and muscovite minerals, fine disseminated micas 
associated within spodumene will report to the concentrate. 
As indicated in the deportment section, most of the fine mica contains high Fe, Mg and K contents. The extent will depend upon on ore selection at the mine.
Mt Cattlin samples
Mineral composition maps, together with the accompanying spodumene liberation analysis, are shown in Figures 92 to 95. Similar to Bald Hill, Mt Cattlin exhibits zones of high-
grade, unaltered spodumene (MC200, MC100, MC1500) 
through to low-grade, highly altered spodumene in post-crystallized, altered regions of the deposit (MC500, MC600). As discussed earlier, these micaceous zones have formed 
by post-crystallization alteration and replacement of 
spodumene by finely crystalline mica. While spodumene particles can be well liberated from coarse quartz and feldspar grains in the low-grade altered zones, even at the coarse sizes, many spodumene particles contain veins 
of Mg- and Fe-enriched mica. The samples from high-
alteration zones (MC500 and MC600 samples) contain between 10% and 30% micas locked within spodumene particles. The extent of mica locked within spodumene 
in samples from altered zones is similar in all the size 
fraction ranges examined. Fine grinding (<38  µm) would be expected to liberate more of the spodumene. However, full liberation would be limited due to the intergranular nature of the micaceous zones within the unaltered parts 
of spodumene. Even the high-grade, white spodumene 
contains small proportions of mica (up to 2% in samples MC100 and MC200). Muscovite is readily liberated from spodumene (MC500). Lepidolite observed in some regions 
of the orebody can be readily liberated in coarse fractions 
(MC1700). Hence, while not the predominant form of lithium in the orebody, it may be concentrated for treatment in a separate process to spodumene. Overall, coarse unaltered and altered spodumene grains can be liberated from quartz 
and feldspar associations. However, micas associated with 
spodumene as fine interstitial veins in voids and fractures, coarse inclusions within spodumene grains and as complex alteration zones within spodumene grains, will restrict the full 
recovery of spodumene.87

Wells et al.Greenbushes samples
Mineral composition maps, together with the  
accompanying spodumene-liberation analysis, are shown in Figures 96 to 99. The ore is dominated by coarse 
spodumene-quartz textural intergrowths, and regions 
with fine spodumene-quartz intergrowths as observed 
in the C3 pit samples described earlier. In all samples examined, the spodumene is mainly liberated, with only 
minor contents of quartz and trace amounts of feldspar. Sample C1200 has around 5% of the spodumene locked 
and associated with pollucite (liberation of pollucite 
is discussed later). Around 10% of the spodumene is locked within quartz and feldspars in the 2.5 to 4  mm 
size fractions, whereas at particle size <250  µm, less 
than 2% of the spodumene has quartz or feldspar 
(mainly albite). Hence, the majority of spodumene can  
be recovered, with very low gangue mineral reporting to  
the concentrate.
The physical liberation characteristic 
behaviour of different lithologies for concentrating spodumene 
To allow comparison between the different deposits, 
the information collated from size-by-size data was 
converted into theoretical grade–recovery curves. The 
theoretical grade–recovery curves expected for each of the four deposits with different lithologies passing a 4 mm size screen are shown in Figure 100.
The theoretical grade–recovery curve for an ore is 
defined as the maximum expected recovery that can be 
achieved by physical separation of a mineral at a given 
grade (McIvor and Finch, 1991). This is determined by 
the surface area liberation of the mineral of interest 
and is directly related to the grind size. Theoretical 
grade–recovery curves generated from 2D-liberation 
measurements tend to overestimate the true liberation characteristics and test work is always required to validate the results. The modal mineralogical distribution 
of spodumene within each size fraction is represented 
on the curve as the grade value at 100% recovery. The proportion of fully liberated spodumene particles, based on the exposed surface area, is represented on the curve as the recovery value achieved at 100% spodumene 
grade. The further the whole curve shifts to the right in 
the graphs, the better the expected grade and recovery 
of spodumene.
In all Pilgangoora samples examined, >90% recovery of 
spodumene can be achieved with expected Li grades 
above 3 wt% (equivalent to 6.5 wt% Li
2O). These are the 
types of grades reported by Pilbara minerals and Altura 
Resources (now part of Pilbara minerals). Full recovery 
is limited in samples PD005, PD008 and PIL3 due to 
spodumene grains containing fine graphic intergrowths 
of quartz and feldspar. Sample PIL1 is further limited 
by the presence of finely disseminated micas within the spodumene particles. Sample PIL2 has less fine graphic 
intergrowths of quartz and feldspar than PIL3 and micas present are made up of mainly coarse, liberated muscovite particles. 
Samples from both Mt Cattlin and Bald Hill show 
variations in spodumene recoveries (60 to >95%) with grades ranging from 3 wt% to 3.5 wt% Li (6.5 – 7.5 wt% 
Li
2O). These values are higher than has been reported 
by Galaxy Resources (Mt Cattlin) and at Bald Hill. This is probably due to gangue material reporting to the 
concentrate at both sites and possibly reflecting non-
optimal DMS circuit operations. The theoretical curves illustrate liberation and recovery of spodumene increases going from highly altered spodumene 60% in BH2700, 
MC1700) to fresh spodumene (>95% in BH100, MC100 
and MC200) particles. The fine, disseminated micas within many spodumene particles observed in both these deposits, reduces the expected recovery of spodumene. Separation of middlings containing high mica and 
feldspar contents through fine grinding would improve 
the recovery of spodumene in this orebody.
Greenbushes samples are well liberated with high recovery 
and Li grades of 3.5 wt% (7.5 wt% Li
2O) over all samples. 
This is largely associated with spodumene being readily liberated from the main gangue mineral, quartz.Figure 96.  T IMA mineral composition map, mineral abundance and

GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western AustraliaLiberation characteristics of heavy minerals 
and pollucite 
While the focus is largely on lithium, the pegmatite ores 
contain recoverable Ta, Sn and, in some cases, Cs minerals, which have been mined and sold as an extra mineral product.
In Pilgangoora samples, while the bulk concentration 
observed in chemical assays is not high, most of the Ta, Nb 
and Sn minerals identified in samples were well liberated in some samples (Fig. 101) and can be separated and concentrated by heavy mineral separation techniques. 
The mineral particles range in size from ~5 µm to 500 µm. 
Cassiterite makes up between 0.01 and 0.03  wt% of samples, with 33% free grains and the rest associated with spodumene grains. Tantalite makes up only 0.05 wt% of the PIL1 sample, whereas it is only 0.02 wt% and 0.03 wt% in the 
PIL2 and PIL3 samples, respectively. 
In the Mt Cattlin (Fig. 102) and Bald Hill (Fig. 103) samples 
both tantalite and cassiterite grains vary from very fine (<5 µm) to coarse sizes (~300 µm). Tantalum minerals are associated with low-grade samples from the highly altered 
zones of the deposit (MC600 and MC1700) and mostly 
locked in gangue minerals. Cassiterite is mostly locked up 
and associated with spodumene in Mt Cattlin samples.At Greenbushes tantalite, stibiomicrolite, cassiterite, pollucite 
and tourmaline exist in a range of particle sizes from <5 µm 
to ~0.5 mm, as illustrated in Figure 104. Around two-thirds 
of the tantalite and stibiomicrolite grains are liberated in 
sample C1100WH, which contains the highest abundance of 
these minerals. In the C3100 sample, cassiterite is liberated 
from a matrix high in feldspar and quartz content. The rest is associated with, and locked in, spodumene and albite. Approximately two-thirds of the pollucite observed in the 
C1200 sample is liberated. A significant proportion of the 
remaining third is associated with spodumene and the rest is associated with feldspar and quartz. Tourmaline (present as schorl and elbaite) is well liberated and occurs in abundance 
in two of the samples (C1-100WH and C3-100). Greenbushes 
also contains the arsenic mineral parabrandtite, which was 
observed in three of the samples (C1-100P and C3-300HP , 
C1200P). The deportment and size of parabrandtite particles 
are shown in Figure 105. Parabrandtite concentration 
is small and exists mainly as inclusions with albite and spodumene. Some of the parabrandtite would report to the 
concentrate as a contaminant, and accordingly would have 
to be managed during the refinery stage.

Wells et al.Overall, Ta minerals in all deposits examined are mainly 
associated with the gangue minerals or are freely liberated under the particle sizes examined in this study. From a 
mineral processing point of view, this makes it easier to 
segregate Ta minerals from spodumene and allow for treatment to upgrade separately via gravity separation techniques, as is performed by mining companies with 
high-grade Ta resources. Some minor associations 
occur within spodumene in some of the Mt Cattlin and Greenbushes samples. A high percentage of cassiterite in most samples are locked and associated with spodumene and, therefore, will report along with spodumene grains 
in the concentrate. Treatment to recover cassiterite 
would have to occur during the refinery stage. As observed in Table 10 (refer to section, Sample selection and methodology), most of the Ta minerals contain 
Nb, with the presence of Fe and Mn associated to the 
columbite-tantalite series. Antimony-bearing, Ta oxide (stibiomicrolite) was only observed in pegmatite samples from Greenbushes. Tourmaline present in samples were mainly liberated or associated with feldspars.

Wells et al.Liberation characteristics – concentrates
Spodumene concentrates collected from the beneficiation 
circuits at five mines were also examined to assess the efficiency of the existing process and compared with the 
collected samples.
Figure 106 shows images of the concentrates from two mine 
sites. Closer inspection reveals a higher content of gangue materials associated within these concentrates. This includes country rock (black basalt materials) and platy mica fragments. 
The majority of the gangue materials appear liberated from the 
spodumene grains, which indicates that further processing could be achieved to reduce the gangue content.
Figure 107 shows the range of different particle sizes of 
products from the different mine sites. These concentrates 
are shipped to refineries in China to recover Li. Both Bald Hill 
and Mt Cattlin use circuits consisting of spiral classification, reflux classifier and heavy medium separation, targeting coarse concentrate products >12 mm in size. Greenbushes concentrate is fine resulting from milling, collection of 
–250  µm size through cyclone classification and flotation 
steps. The Pilgangoora mines use a combination of staged heavy media separation, grinding, flotation and low/high intensity magnetic separation to generate chemical 
grade spodumene. Around 35 to 45% of the particles from 
Pilgangoora concentrates are above 250  µm in size. Fines generated in these plants are either stockpiled or potentially treated as separate products. Gravity separation techniques are also used to collect and concentrate tantalite in several of 
these mines.
Table 12 shows the main elemental composition of  
the different concentrates and illustrates the variation 
between different deposits. Generally, mines are looking to produce high-grade concentrates in the order of +6% Li
2O,  
with an Fe203 content at <1.0% and a mica content <0.5%.  
The Li grades shown in Table 12 are similar or slightly less than those observed in the theoretical liberation 
analysis carried out in section, Liberation characteristics of 
spodumene. The difference is associated with the efficiency of the mineral separation techniques used to concentrate the spodumene from the gangue materials. Figure 108 shows 
the mineral abundance derived from TIMA modal analysis 
of polished mounts, together with mineral associations with spodumene (expressed as a percentage of the spodumene that is fully liberated). Greenbushes has the lowest elemental impurity levels compared with the other concentrates, with 
most spodumene grains fully liberated and only a small 
residual quartz and mica content exists in the concentrate sample. Iron and K are higher in Mt Cattlin reflecting the abundance of micas and the Fe content of spodumene.
Overall, the Li grades vary between 2.9 and 3.2 wt%, with a 
range of Fe contents (0.16, 0.87 and 1.87 wt% Fe
2O3). Particle 
size P80 ranges from 4 mm to 18 mm. Up to 20% gangue 
material reports along with spodumene to the concentrate. 
Of these, between 5 and 10% gangue are locked or occur with 
spodumene in the concentrate. The physical association of spodumene with gangue material is similar to that observed in section, Liberation characteristics of spodumene. The 
presence of quartz, feldspar and micas in the spodumene 
concentrates will report to the lithium refinery (calcination and acid baking). Optical ore sorting, prior to the heavy mineral separation circuits, is currently being used by both Pilbara minerals and Galaxy Resources Ltd to improve Li grades and 
reduce gangue content in the concentrators.

GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western AustraliaCalcination behaviour of mineral 
constituents
To recover lithium from spodumene concentrate requires a 
calcination step to render lithium in the spodumene structure 
amenable to extraction. Although studies in the literature 
have alluded to lithium recovery affected by conditions and 
processing, very little is published on the behaviour and 
effect of impurities and mineral constituents associated 
with spodumene during the calcination step. It also appears 
that little work has been done in the lithium industry to 
develop an understanding of the fusibility of different mineral 
and elemental components associated with spodumene 
concentrates during calcination (Harman, 2019).
Key findings
Factors identified in this work that affect the calcination of 
spodumene concentrates from the deposits examined are 
as follows:
•	All spodumenes have Li content ranging from 3.5 to 
3.8 wt% and show some minor variation in Mn, Fe, K, Na 
and Ca content. Of most significance is Fe and Mn, which 
can be present in the 0.01 to 1.5 wt% range.•	Spodumene concentrates can have high mineral 
impurities. For example, mica exists in several forms ranging from fine interstitial veins in voids and fractures to coarse inclusions within spodumene, and as complex 
alteration zones within spodumene. The micas have 
high and varying Fe, Mn, Mg and K concentrations relative to spodumene and are identified as muscovite, lepidolite and chlorite/cookeite phases. Feldspars and 
quartz are also present as minor inclusions within 
some spodumene grains. Apart from some Pilgangoora samples, calcite occurs as a minor inclusion phase.
•	The temperature range that favours the α–β conversion of spodumene required to make lithium amendable to extraction ranges from 1050 °C to 1100 °C. At 950 °C the 
α-form is stable. At 1050 °C, α-spodumene has mainly 
converted to β-spodumene via an intermediate γ-phase that is less ‘massive’ in appearance with marked porosity. At 1100 °C, spodumene exists in the β-form with coarse 
porosity and is highly fragmented. The porosity and 
texture of spodumene particles calcined at 1050 °C and 1100 °C appeared favourable for acid baking, followed by water leaching to extract lithium.
•	The thermal transformation of spodumene is affected by the exothermic reaction of the oxidation of Fe and Mn 
present within both micas and spodumene grains.

Wells et al.•	The exothermic oxidation of Mn and Fe promotes 
both the thermal transformation to β-spodumene at a lower temperature and physical disintegration into fine 
particles during calcination. Hence, some control of 
the rate of heating and oxidation during the calcination process of high-Fe spodumene may be required to reduce the development of fines.
•	The content of gangue minerals in the ore concentrate 
needs to be minimized as many of the gangue minerals 
have melting points or decomposition temperatures below the spodumene transformation temperature (e.g. micas and carbonates). Melting contributes to the formation of clinker which tends to line the internal 
surface of the calcine roaster. Large deposits of 
clinker may lead to production delays and increased maintenance costs.
•	Micaceous minerals (particularly those high in Fe, Mg, K and Na) melt early during calcination and this melt 
phase may coat and infiltrate spodumene grains, which 
can prevent full conversion of spodumene to the β-form. However, the highly exothermic nature of the oxidation of Fe and Mn in Fe/Mn-bearing micas during calcination 
can also promote spodumene transformation. As 
observed in this study, micas are prevalent in spodumene grains from Mt Cattlin and Bald Hill deposits.
•	Feldspars form partial melting eutectics that coat spodumene grains and increase the refractory nature of spodumene. Maintaining the kiln temperature at 
~1100  °C, if possible, would reduce the impact of 
feldspar-melt formation.
Overall, a controlled heating rate and prevention or reduction of mineral impurities in the spodumene concentrate will favour conversion of spodumene.
Methodology for assessment of thermal 
properties of major mineral components within pegmatites
Major mineral components in each pegmatite sample were 
collected by carefully breaking off pieces with a hammer and chisel or cutting with a fine diamond saw. The specimens 
were characterized using optical imaging and automated 
digital imaging on polished sample mounts to determine the 
modal mineralogy of lithium ore and gangue minerals. Bulk mineralogy by X-ray powder diffraction studies and chemical assays were obtained on all specimens. The concentrations 
of Li and the distribution of elements (e.g. B, Rb, Cs, Fe, Mn, 
F) within selected mineral grains were quantified by LA-ICP-MS and EPMA. EPMA measurement of the Si content of spodumene, feldspar and mica was used to normalize the 
trace element data generated by LA-ICP-MS analysis. A sub-
microscopic evaluation on selected lithium mineral grains was undertaken to study the variability of lithium and other elements within minerals. This work used a combination of the FIB-SEM with ToF-SIMS, electron backscatter diffraction 
(EBSD), and XRD to study the compositional variation in 
minerals. Details of procedures are outlined in Appendix 3.
The thermal properties of a selection of Li-ore and gangue 
minerals, which represent different mineral constituents within pegmatite ores were evaluated. For XRD and thermal 
gravimetric studies, representative sub-samples were prepared by lightly crushing the samples with a mortar and 
pestle followed by micronizing in ethanol to generate fine powders and to prevent contaminates caused by mechanical 
grinding. Samples were evaluated using the following 
techniques:
•	Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) — Thermal 
gravimetric analysis was performed using a TA 
Instruments SDT Q600 simultaneous differential thermal analysis (DTA)–TGA. Approximately 20  mg of 
a sample was weighed into a 90-µL alumina crucible 
with a matched empty crucible as a reference. The sample was heated from ambient to 1200 °C at 20 °C per minute in an air atmosphere flowing at 100 mL per 
minute. The temperature scale of the instrument was 
calibrated using the melting points of 99.999% indium (156.60 °C), 99.99+% tin (231.93 °C), 99.99+% zinc (419.53  °C), 99.99% silver (961.78  °C), and 99.999% gold (1064.18  °C). The balance was calibrated over 
the temperature range using alumina mass standards 
provided by the instrument manufacturer. The heat flow between the pans was calibrated using a sapphire disk provided by the instrument manufacturer. The cell 
constant was fine-tuned using the heat of fusion of zinc 
(113 J/g). 
•	In situ XRD thermal analysis  — To characterize changes 
in mineralogy during calcination, in situ XRD thermal analysis was undertaken using a Thermo Fisher ARL 
Equinox 5000 XRD with an Anton Paar HTK 1200N oven, 
parallel beam and Mo Kα incident radiation. Tests were carried out on a white spodumene sample, with little impurity content and a green spodumene with partial alteration, at heating rates of 5 °C/min and 20 °C/min to 
1200 °C before cooling. Data were collected continuously 
every 10 °C. Phase abundance was quantified by Rietveld refinement using Topas™ software.
•	Muffle furnace studies — For calcination tests, cubic 
blocks (≈1 cm
3) of representative examples of different 
spodumene types were made by taking large, single spodumene crystals and cutting them into cubes with 
a diamond saw. Prepared spodumene cubes were 
photographed, weighed and the dimensions measured before and after heating tests. Spodumene cube samples in duplicates were placed on a ceramic plate 
at the base of a Thermo Scientific FB1300 Thermolyne 
electric muffle furnace. Samples were heated by ramping up at 20  °C/min and then held at a fixed temperature for two hours, before cooling to room temperature. The temperature was set and monitored by a calibrated 
thermocouple, located near the sample. Fresh samples 
were heated separately at 950 °C, 1050 °C and 1100 °C in an ambient atmosphere. Polished section mounts of mineral blocks before and after heat treatment were 
produced and studied separately to track the thermal 
transformations of spodumene and associated gangue minerals.
Selection and characteristics of samples
Images, mineral composition and chemical analyses of different spodumene and associated gangue mineral specimens selected for testing are illustrated in Figure 109, 
with mineralogical abundance and chemical composition 
presented in Tables 13 and 14, respectively. The spodumene 109
GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western Australiasamples vary from white to green hues, which is related to 
colouration from impurities within the mineral structure, as well as from fine inclusions or alteration products. 
Spodumene with impurities, such as Fe and Mn, which 
substitute for Al in the spodumene crystal structure, are responsible for colour variation. 
There are different types of micas present in pegmatite 
samples. Primary mica is associated with the main 
crystallization of pegmatite and typically exists as silvery 
muscovite flakes (BH-2500) that appear as a ‘book-like’ texture or disseminated in ring patterns around host spodumene laths. The other micaceous type has formed by post-crystallization alteration and replacement of 
spodumene by finely crystalline mica (e.g. BH2600-refer to 
the section Spodumene morphology and alteration: insight into pegmatite crystallization evolution). These secondary micas have a variable mineral composition but occur as a 
combination of muscovite and chlorite. Feldspars also vary 
in composition depending on whether they formed during early or post crystallization events. X-ray diffraction studies revealed all spodumene specimens contain trace amounts of mineral impurities, mainly in the form of micas (Table 13). 
The feldspar specimens examined in this study (MC400 and 
BH2300) are a mixture of albite and microcline associated with solid solution variations between Na and K rich varieties and contain some quartz. The secondary micas range in 
mineral composition but are a combination of muscovite 
and chlorite.
Table 14 shows the bulk chemical composition of the 
mineral specimens. Mt Cattlin spodumene samples (MC200, 300, 1500) have higher Fe and Mn contents than Bald Hill spodumene samples (BH0100, 1300, 
1425). The Pilgangoora spodumenes (PIL100, PD001, 
PD006 and PD008) have a range of Fe contents, whereas Bald Hill spodumene samples have moderate concentrates of Fe. Pilgangoora samples have a greater 
Mn and Ca content than other samples associated with 
the presence of calcite.Figure 109.  Im ages of different spodumenes and associated gangue minerals. Spodumene can exist in different colours depending upon element impurities

Wells et al.Morphology and composition of spodumene 
specimens
Images of the different spodumene samples showing 
variations in textures are illustrated in Figures 110 and 111. The composition of lithium and main impurity 
elements in spodumene and the associated mica 
inclusions/alterations are shown in Table 15 and Table 16, respectively.
All spodumenes have Li contents between 3.5 and 3.8 wt% 
(Table 15), but vary in Mn, Fe, K, Na and Ca as the minor 
constituents. Notable variations occur in the Fe, Mn, Sn 
and Ta contents between the different spodumenes. While spodumene compositions do not show any significant deviation from the ideal formula, LiAlSi
2O6, they can 
contain minor contents of Fe, Mn, Na, K, Mg and Ca in the structure (London and Burt, 1982; Deer et al, 1992; 
refer to the section Spodumene composition). Mica 
exists in several forms as fine interstitial veins in voids and fractures, as coarse inclusions within spodumene grains and as complex alteration zones within spodumene 
grains. The micas have high and varying contents of Fe, Mn, Mg and K relative to spodumene and are identified as 
muscovite, lepidolite and chlorite/cookeite phases (e.g. 
section, Spodumene morphology and alteration: insight 
into pegmatite crystallization evolution). Feldspars and quartz are also minor inclusions within some spodumene grains, with a sample tested from Pilgangoora containing 
calcite.
The presence of Rb and Cs in spodumene are likely 
artefacts from closely associated, fine-grained mica. The Mt Cattlin spodumene samples have higher Fe (average 1500  ppm) and Mn (386–836  ppm) contents than Bald Hill, whereas Pilgangoora spodumenes range 
in Fe contents (135–1340  ppm) that is similar to Bald 
Hill, but higher in Mn (average 1160  ppm) and calcium content (average 370 ppm). The Mn content is higher in the Pilgangoora spodumene. Tin and Ta contents vary 
markedly between the different spodumene, with Sn 
contents highest in the light-grey spodumene (MC200) (Table 15). The purple colour of the Pilgangoora (PIL100) spodumene may be due to the greater Mn content incorporated within spodumene.

GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western AustraliaIn hand-specimen and optical images of the material 
examined, spodumene appears relatively ‘clean’ in appearance showing little or no alteration. However, TIMA 
mineral mapping highlights a pervasive, finely developed 
network of micaceous alteration, developed along cracks or cleavage fractures as highlighted in the K–K element distribution maps for the Bald Hill spodumene examples 
(Fig. 110) and as detected by TIMA mineral mapping 
of representative examples of spodumene selected for calcination study (Fig. 111; muscovite shown in light-blue). Both the Bald Hill example (BH1300) and Pilgangoora (PIL100) spodumene contain veins mapped 
as feldspar (red) (Fig. 111). The Pilgangoora spodumene 
also has a high quartz (blue) content and displays later-stage, calcite veining that crosscuts earlier quartz and spodumene (Fig. 111). 
BSE imaging and element distribution mapping show 
the extent and compositional complexity of the 
micaceous alteration (Figs 110, 111). Mapping of the K–Kα distribution in BH0100 reveals trace quantities of ‘muscovite’ that exist as fine, interstitial veins along cracks and cleavage fractures (Fig. 110). Micaceous alteration 
(green) of BH2250 is significantly more developed, making 
up about 25% of the particle (Fig. 110), with the altered micaceous zone enriched in Al, K, Fe and Mg (Fig. 110), and significantly reduced in Li (Table 16). Micaceous 
alteration of spodumene also results in significant 
concentration of the minor element content compared to the precursor spodumene (Fig. 110).The light-grey, Mt Cattlin spodumene (MC200) also contains fine mica disseminated throughout the spodumene, whereas the green spodumene (MC300) 
contains fine, K and Mg-mica veins, and coarse inclusions 
of a K–Fe–Mn mica, celadonite–montdorite phase. The micas associated with spodumene grains contain high levels of Fe and Mn relative to spodumene. The high K, Rb 
and, in some cases, Cs contents are characteristic of Li-
bearing micas. The Li content is low (~1000 ppm) except in sample MC300, which has a high Li content similar to zinnwaldite type composition.

Wells et al.Thermal transformation of primary 
spodumene and altered spodumene 
The mineralogical transformations during heating of primary 
white and altered green spodumene were characterized and tracked by in-situ, XRD studies. Rietveld-refined XRPD data 
for the white spodumene (BH1300) and green spodumene 
(BH2250) prior to heating are shown in Figure 112. The white spodumene is mainly α-spodumene with minor quartz and trace muscovite, whereas the green spodumene contains a 
significant amount of mica. The mica in the green spodumene 
matches a combination of muscovite and lepidolite structures described in the literature. Using the internal standard method, the amorphous content in both spodumene samples was calculated to be ~15 wt%. Careful sample preparation should 
have minimized amorphous material formed during pulp 
milling. However, quantification of the amorphous content is hard to determine as calculation of the amorphous content is sensitive to how well the experimental and the calculated 
data match.
A contour plot tracking the transformation of α-spodumene 
to β-spodumene via an intermediate γ-spodumene phase for the green spodumene is shown in Figure 113a. The measured content of crystalline phases derived from refinement of XRD patterns for both white and green spodumene (Bald 
Hill) as a function of temperature, θ is shown in Figure 113b. 
Figure 113c illustrates an example of one of the Rietveld-refined XRD data patterns for calcined white spodumene at 1030°C. Under the same heating conditions, the α–β 
spodumene transformation begins at different temperatures 
with conversion of α-spodumene to γ-spodumene starting at 40 °C to 50 °C lower for white spodumene (930 °C) compared to green spodumene (970 °C) (Fig. 113b).β-spodumene is reported to form at temperatures in the range 950 °C to 1100 °C (White and McVay, 1958; Barbosa et al., 
2014; Peltosaari et al., 2015; Welsch et al., 2015; Salakjani et 
al., 2016; Rosales et al., 2019) and γ-spodumene forms in the temperature range of 800 °C to 950 °C (Peltosaari et al., 2015; Salakjani et al., 2016). Four reaction pathways during the transition of spodumene have been reported in the literature 
(Abdullah et al., 2019; Salakjani et al., 2019). At a slow-heating 
rate an intermediate γ-spodumene phase is produced from α-spodumene, whereas at a fast-heating rate direct transition of crystalline α-spodumene to β-spodumene is expected. 
Evidence of an intermediate γ-spodumene phase is apparent 
in data collected in the current study as exemplified by the presence of 010 and 020 peaks in Figure 113a, and observed in the modelling and measurement of phase abundance in Figure 113b. The presence of γ-spodumene over the range of 
α-spodumene transformation indicates that direct transition 
of crystalline α-spodumene to β-spodumene would not be the main pathway to β-spodumene in the current study.
Work reported in the literature also indicates that spodumene 
can convert to an intermediate, disordered phase before 
transforming to γ-spodumene (Gasalla and Pereira, 1990; 
Peltosaari et al., 2015; Salakjani et al., 2017; Moore et al., 2018). In the current study, the amorphous content was estimated based on the addition of corundum as an internal standard to the sample during sample preparation. However, 
results were inconclusive and further work is required to 
provide a more accurate measurement of phase abundance.
Plots of the logarithmic concentration of α-spodumene as 
a function of time and the calculated rates of α-spodumene transformation are shown in Figure 114.

spodumene; and c) example of the Rietveld refined X-ray powder diffraction data of calcined white spodumene at 1030 °C, matching α, γ and

Wells et al.The logarithmic, kinetic curves show that spodumene 
transformation as a first order reaction, and as the temperature increases the rate of conversion of 
α-spodumene increases three-fold for white spodumene 
and two-fold for green spodumene. The initial rate of α-spodumene transformation in both spodumene samples is slower at the beginning and accelerates towards the 
end with increasing temperature. While the α-spodumene 
transformation occurs at a lower temperature for white spodumene, the rate of conversion is faster for green spodumene (Fig. 114). At >900  °C the conversion rate of white spodumene is much faster than green spodumene.
Cross-sectioned mounts of calcined spodumene samples 
(Fig. 115) show that the product formed from white 
spodumene is free-flowing, fine-powdered β-spodumene. ToF-SIMS analysis indicated that lithium in calcined spodumene is evenly dispersed in the powder (Fig. 115a). 
In contrast, the green spodumene sample has fused into 
a mixture of β-spodumene and melt to form beads. ToF-SIMS analysis shows the melt, which contains K from the micaceous zones, has encapsulated β-spodumene represented by the Li-rich zone (Fig. 115b).
The slower α–β conversion of green spodumene can be 
interpreted as a result of decomposed mica encapsulating spodumene and reducing the rate of heat transfer rate to spodumene for phase transformation to occur.Thermal gravimetric analysis of spodumene 
and common LCT pegmatite minerals
Comparison of the thermal properties of spodumene with common LCT pegmatite minerals
To understand better the nature of the thermal 
decomposition of LCT pegmatites, a comparative TGA of spodumene and the gangue phases, mica and feldspar 
was undertaken from hand-picked minerals collected in 
this study. An overlay of the different differential thermo-gravimetric analysis (DTGA) graphs for the different minerals is shown in Figure 116. The temperature 
range associated with loss of adsorbed water and the 
dehydroxylation stages for micas is also shown in Figure 116. The TGA of most mineral components found in pegmatites have been reported (e.g. Földvári, 2011) and can aid in the interpretation of results.
As shown in Figure 116, the thermal alteration of 
spodumene shows a strong endothermic peak (blue line) 
that is distinguishable from thermal transformations of other common, LCT pegmatite minerals.
Under the operating conditions, the conversion of 
α-spodumene to β-spodumene is represented as an 
endothermic peak (Fig. 116; blue line), which starts at 
around 950  °C and is completed at around 1110  °C. The α–β transformation temperature range is similar to that depicted earlier in Figure 113b. Apart from a slight 0 0 20 10 40 60 20

Wells et al.loss in weight (~0.5  wt%) associated with dehydration 
of minor mineral impurities within the spodumene at lower temperatures, there is no significant loss in weight associated with spodumene transformation. While both 
α- and γ-spodumene undergo endothermic reactions when 
transforming to β-spodumene, the direct conversion of α- 
to γ-spodumene is reported to be an exothermic reaction 
(Botto et al., 1976; Gasalla and Pereira, 1990; Salakjani 
et al., 2016, 2017). A slight increase in the temperature 
difference curve occurs around 950  °C. However, any exothermic peak is masked by the corresponding endothermic transformation to β-spodumene.
The thermal analysis curves for muscovite (orange dotted 
and full lines) show a loss of ~0.5 wt% associated with the desorption of surface water. Muscovite dehydroxylates in the temperature range 820–920 °C, which is accompanied 
by a loss in weight of ~3.5  wt%. With increasing 
temperature, non-equilibrium melting of muscovite with compositionally different layer types produces a melt 
phase, corundum and leucite (Barlow and Manning, 1999). 
At temperatures between 1100 °C and 1200 °C, another 
endothermic peak associated with further muscovite 
dehydroxylation occurs (Schomburg and Zwahr, 1997; 
Foldvari, 2011). The muscovite sample also contains quartz 
and the endothermic transition representing alpha to beta 
crystal inversion can be observed at 573 °C (Schelz, 1976).
In both spodumene and muscovite samples, a small 
exothermic peak between 300 °C and ~450 °C was accompanied by a small decrease in weight of spodumene 
and coincides with the start of continued loss in weight 
for muscovite. In mica this can be attributed to the auto-oxidation of ferrous to ferric Fe (Fe
2+→Fe3+) present in 
the mineral structure and is normally accompanied by a dehydroxylation endotherm (Foldvari, 2011). Oxidation 
of Fe
2+ to Fe3+ normally results in an increase in weight. 
However, changes in weight may be offset by initiation of 
the loss of structural OH/water.The thermal analysis curve for feldspar yields a very 
broad endothermic peak from 1060 °C to 1200 °C and is 
associated with feldspar melting over a large temperature 
interval (Fig. 116; yellow line). The melting transformation 
of feldspar occurs toward completion of spodumene 
transformation (Fig. 116). Studies reported for albite 
indicate that increasing heat rate increases the melting 
point (1143  °C at 5  °C/min to 1167  °C at 20  °C/min) (Johnson and McCauley, 2005). However, with rapid heating the higher the temperature of melting, the more quickly 
albite melts.
The thermal analysis curve for a sample of secondary 
mica reveals a series of endothermic peaks and one exothermic peak associated with the decomposition 
of a mixture of chlorite and muscovite (Fig. 116 ; green 
line). As observed, decomposition of secondary mica occurs at a lower temperature than the spodumene 
transformation. For chlorite, dehydroxylation takes place 
generally in two steps with an endothermic peak between 
470 °C and 650 °C associated with dehydroxylation of the interlayer hydroxide in the chlorite structure and a second 
endothermic peak between 650 °C and 1000 °C associated with the dehydroxylation of the mica layer (Foldvari, 2011). 
The number of hydroxyls belonging to the hydroxide sheet is three times more than in the mica layer. The exothermic peak (at ~1020 °C) represents the chlorite recrystallizing 
into new minerals (e.g. olivine, spinel and enstatite). The 
temperature interval between the second dehydroxylation and the following exothermic peak varies for different 
chlorites and has been shown to correlate with the Mg 
content in the structure (the greater the MgO content, the 
larger the interval) (Smykatz-Kloss, 1974).
The cause of a small endothermic peak at 450 °C is unclear 
and is aligned with ~0.35 wt% loss in weight but appears 
prominent in all micas collected from samples formed 
during late-stage alteration and crystallization of the pegmatite deposits (Fig. 116). 
While factors such as heating rate, mineral composition 
and particle size influence mineral transformations, 
it is evident in Figure 116 that micaceous minerals present in pegmatite-mineral assemblages alter at lower 
temperatures before the transformation of spodumene 
occurs. The partial melting of feldspars can be avoided 
if the temperature can be sufficiently controlled below 
1100 °C. 
In the calcination process, it is important to establish 
conditions which favour the α–β conversion of spodumene 
without interference from other minerals associated with spodumene concentrates. Studies reported in the literature 
have alluded to lithium extraction decreasing with the 
impurity content in the feed material and suggest that lithium recovery may be limited by impurities coating some 
β-spodumene particles (Lajoie-Leroux et al., 2018).
Comparison of the thermal properties of different 
spodumenes 
A comparison of the thermal gravimetric curves of 
spodumene from the Bald Hill, Mt Cattlin and Pilgangoora sites are shown in Figure 117. As described earlier, Mt 
Cattlin sample has higher Fe content than spodumene 
collected from the other deposits (Table 15). In all thermal gravimetric curves, the weight loss is largely associated Figure 116.  Comparis on of the thermo gravimetric analysis of 
representative mineral examples observed in LCT pegmatites 
(heating rate 20 °C/min). The percentage weight lost is 
shown on the left-hand axis and corresponds to the dotted 
line data. The differential thermal analysis curve for each 
corresponding phase is shown as a solid line. The temperature 
range associated with loss of adsorbed water and the 
dehydroxylation stages for micas is also illustrated

GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western Australiawith the dehydroxylation of mica within spodumene grains. 
Sample BH-2250 has a significantly greater mica content (11 wt%) than other samples consistent with the greater 
loss in weight compared with the other samples. A weight 
loss of between 0.5 and 2.5 wt% occurs depending upon the amount of mica associated with spodumene. 
While the endothermic peak associated with the conversion 
of α-spodumene to β-spodumene is at around 1050 °C, 
there are significant differences between the thermal 
transformation of spodumene from Bald Hill and spodumene from Mt Cattlin. The endotherm recorded for the Mt Cattlin spodumene occurs as a doublet with a generally weaker, high temperature shoulder on the main 
α–β transformation endotherm (Fig. 117). Development 
of the doublet suggests that the α–β transformation is partly inhibited or is slowed until a certain temperature is attained before going to completion. No such doublet was observed for the Bald Hill samples evaluated. The doublet can be attributed to the greater Fe content (1.1 – 1.6 wt%) 
associated with mica in the Mt Cattlin spodumene 
compared to spodumene at Bald Hill, with an Fe content of 0.7 wt%. The exothermic peak at around 370 °C in both sets of data in Figure 117 is attributed to the oxidation of ferrous ion in the mica as discussed earlier.
The shift in the endothermic peak position correlates with 
the Fe content in the spodumene structure and the Fe 
content of mineral impurities associated with spodumene particles (Fig. 118a). High Fe-rich mica has a significant effect on spodumene transitional temperature (Fig. 118b; 
Table 16). Similarly, Na, K, and Ca correlate with the thermal 
transformation of Fe-bearing mica contained within spodumene. Manganese that tends to be in the divalent state within micas is also oxidized and shows a similar correlation as Fe but is not as pronounced. 
High-impurity contents within spodumene grains have 
been attributed to lower conversion temperatures (White and McVay, 1958; Salakjani et al., 2019). Spodumene is considered a poor conductor of heat and it has been inferred that elemental impurities may affect the 
thermal conductivity leading to faster heat transfer 
within spodumene (White and McVay, 1958; Botto et  al., 1976). The results reported in the current study conclusively demonstrate that the exothermic reaction 
of the oxidation of Fe and Mn within both micas and 
spodumene grains promotes the thermal transformation

Wells et al.of spodumene at a lower temperature. However, if mica 
is present in high abundance, the melts formed during the decomposition of mica at elevated temperatures can 
encapsulate spodumene and reduce the rate of conversion 
of α-spodumene to β-spodumene, as observed earlier in section, Thermal transformation of primary spodumene and altered spodumene.
Morphology and texture changes during 
calcination of different spodumenes
Spodumene samples of BH1300, MC200, MC300 and 
PIL100 depicted in Figure 110 were heated and the textures characterized at 950 °C, 1050 °C and 1100 °C to gauge the 
effect calcination has on different spodumene types.
Phase transformations of different spodumenes at 
different temperatures
The relative abundance of crystallized phases as a function 
of temperature for the different spodumenes is shown in Figure 119. Calcination of all spodumenes followed similar 
phase transitions under the heating conditions used in these 
experiments with the original α-spodumene transforming to β-spodumene via γ-spodumene. Mica that was observed in original samples could not be detected in the heated samples. 
While α-spodumene is depleted at 1050 °C, the transformation 
to β-spodumene is not complete with γ-spodumene present (Fig. 119). The slow transfer of heat through the coarse particles undoubtedly reduced the rate of complete conversion of γ-spodumene to β-spodumene. Extending the 
heating time would have completed the transformation to 
β-spodumene. Almost complete conversion to β-spodumene is observed in samples heated at 1100  °C. Quartz content remains similar in samples at different temperature, except for 
the final Pilgangoora sample that had a slightly higher quartz 
content than the other samples. Notably, the transformation of α-spodumene to β-spodumene appears to start at a lower temperature in the Fe-rich MC300 spodumene than for other samples, with around 20 wt% of the α-spodumene converted 
to γ-spodumene at 950 °C. This correlates with the effect of 
Fe content on spodumene thermal transformation reported in the previous section.
Physical characteristics of calcined spodumene 
grains 
The dimensions of the spodumene blocks before and 
after heating were measured to track the expansion of spodumene at different temperatures. A plot of the ratio 
of the final volume over the initial volume as a function of 
temperature is shown in Figure 120. The spodumene volume remained the same up to around 1000 °C. At temperatures >1050  °C, the volume doubles in size, consistent with total 
conversion of α-spodumene. All calcined spodumene samples 
exhibited an expansion of about double the volume of the uncalcined samples. However, there is a variation in volume for the different calcined spodumene that appears related to spodumene composition as illustrated in the next section.
The results are consistent with that reported by Salakjani 
et al. (2016), who observed that the specific gravity of 
α-spodumene converted to β-spodumene decreased from 40

Surface morphology and textures of calcined 
spodumene samples 
Optical images of different spodumene samples before and 
after heating show marked differences in the appearance between the different samples of spodumene (Fig. 121). 
At temperatures >1000  °C, the white spodumene samples 
(Bald Hill and Mt Cattlin) produced a white, chalky product. A light-brown, glassy melt phase was observed to have formed on the white calcined spodumene, whereas the glassy 
phase that formed on the purple spodumene is light-yellow. 
At 950  °C, the white spodumene samples have a marbled, mottled appearance. In contrast to the other spodumenes, the calcined green spodumene (MC300) is light-brown with a woody appearance, which was observed under all heating 
conditions (950  °C, 1050  °C and 1100  °C). The dark-black, 
‘burnt-out’ regions within the calcined green spodumene, MC300, are associated with K, Fe and Mn mica (celadonite) inclusions, which were oxidized during heating. Cross-sections 
of the calcined particles from Mt Cattlin (MC300) and Bald 
Hill (BH1300) have an iron stained appearance, whereas the purple Pilgangoora spodumene remained white. The calcined green Mt Cattlin spodumene is significantly darker brown in colour than calcined BH1300 and MC300 samples (Fig. 121).
BSE images (Fig. 122) reveal the calcined spodumene 
particles have fragmented surfaces. The calcined green 
spodumene (MC300) shows fine, iron oxide particles, which appear attached and imbedded within the calcined spodumene surface, indicating exsolution and oxidation of 
Fe from spodumene during heating. Some fine particles of 
iron oxide were observed in the other calcined spodumene samples but were not as abundant as for the calcined spodumene, MC300. 
The smooth, porous melt coats the calcined spodumene 
grains as illustrated for white (BH1300) and purple (PIL100) 
spodumenes (Fig. 121). EDS analysis confirmed the composition of these melts to be K and Mg-rich aluminium 
silicate, similar to that observed for mica in the original 
unheated spodumene (Table 16).
Figure 123 shows the effect that Fe content in spodumene 
has on the calcined particle morphology. Apart from causing Fe oxide staining on calcined grains, the highly exothermic nature of the oxidation of Fe during calcination causes the 
calcined spodumene to disintegrate into small particles. 
Hence, during the calcination step to convert spodumene into the β-form, high-Fe spodumene is likely to create issues with the management of finer particles in both the 
calcination and the acid-bake leach. The fine particles will 
also create issues (blockages) with the filtering of solids to recover the liquor for lithium recovery. Hence, some control on the rate of heating and oxidation during the calcination process of high-Fe spodumenes (>~0.5  wt%) may be 
required to reduce the development of fines.
Textures of calcined spodumene at different 
temperatures 
Samples of the Mt Cattlin, high-grade spodumene were 
heated for two hours in a muffle furnace at a range of temperatures (950  °C, 1050  °C and 1100  °C) separately 
and mounted in cross-section to study the calcined texture. 
BSE imaging and TIMA mineral distribution mapping of the internal structure of calcined Mt Cattlin (MC200) illustrates the development of melt formation and changes 
in spodumene texture with increasing temperature (Fig. 124). 
At 950 °C, spodumene in the α-form is stable, with only minor melt formation occurring along cleavage-controlled cracks (Fig. 124a). At 1050 °C, α-spodumene has mainly converted to β-spodumene that is less ‘massive’ in appearance with 
marked porosity and contains patchy melt developed with a 
vesicular nature (Fig. 124b). At 1100 °C, spodumene exists in the β-form and is significantly fragmented, together with fluid-flow textures, such as vapour bubble casts 
encapsulated by melt formation (Fig. 124c).
Band contrast imaging and orientation maps reveal the 
calcined spodumene particles, in the Mt Cattlin example (MC200), consist of fine crystallites in different orientations (Fig. 125). At 1050  °C, calcined grains are predominately β-spodumene (blue in phase map) with some relict 
γ-spodumene (yellow in phase map) dispersed irregularly. 
At temperatures above 1050 °C, the melted mica (yellow) is mobile and forms liquid coatings in fractures and pores of the calcined spodumene as discussed in the next section.Expansion (Final Vol/Initial Vol)BH1300

spodumene
The composition of mica associated with spodumene in the 
samples examined is markedly varied. Figure 126 shows the melting product of two micas associated with spodumene 
samples, MC300 and MC200. In both cases, the melted micas have coated the calcined spodumene under the 
conditions used to promote the α–β transformation. The 
black-sintered (‘burnt-out’) regions observed in the calcined 
MC300 spodumene sample is associated with the oxidation of Fe(II) and Mn(II) during mica decomposition, resulting in the formation of fine (1–10 µm) particles of Fe and Mn oxides. EBSD analysis reveals the Fe and Mn particles have

Wells et al.a hematite structure. As illustrated in the band contrast, 
phase and elemental (EDS) maps, Fe- and Mn-rich, hematite particles are concentrated along the edge or suspended in 
the K-, Si- and Al-rich melt matrix, coating the β-spodumene 
surface (Fig. 126a). The black-sintered regions within the calcined spodumene particles result from the highly exothermic reaction of the oxidation of ferrous ion and Mn 
from mica. 
For sample MC200, ToF-SIMS analysis reveals the melt 
phase coating the porous, calcined spodumene surfaces is enriched in Mg, K, Cs and Rb associated with melted 
potassium–magnesium–aluminium–silicate mica inclusions 
(Fig. 126b). The mica contains no detectable Fe and there is no evidence of black-sintered regions within spodumene particle. Similar findings were observed for micas calcined 
with spodumene in samples BH1300 and PIL100 (Fig. 127).
Primary muscovite and secondary micas generally follow 
similar decomposition trends. However, during calcination muscovite appears to retain much of its morphological 
structure as observed in Figure 128, relative to the more 
reactivated secondary micas with higher Fe, Mg and Na 
abundances. The presence of muscovite particles in the kiln 
is not desirable as they will be prone to become airborne 
and would likely end up near the hot flame zone at levelled 
temperature (~1800 °C) of the rotary kiln.
It is well known that Fe has a marked effect on the thermal 
decompositional behaviour of mica minerals (Schomburg 
and Zwahr, 1997). As observed in the DTGA curves, the 
exothermic reaction of the oxidation of ferrous ion within mica promotes the dehydroxylation of mica and ultimately 
melt formation. Mica decomposition has been reported 
to occur via a topotactic breakdown mechanism with the 
oxidation of Fe and Mn cations and their displacement from 
the mica octahedral structural layer (Barlow and Manning, 
1999). The production of Fe and Mn oxide within micaceous 
melt zones, within calcined spodumene, was illustrated in

GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western Australiaearlier figures. The formation of the melt phase is attributed 
to a combination of interlayer cations (K, Mg, Na) and the breakdown of the tetrahedral sheets:
The ternary diagram for the system K
2O–Al2O3–SiO2 predicts 
that the composition of the first melt to form from a feldspar 
composition would contain 30% K2O, 67% SiO2 and 3% Al2O3 
(point E) (Fig. 129). Melting contributes to the formation of clinker which tends to line the internal surface of the calcine 
roaster. Hence, the mica content needs to be limited.
Feldspar in calcined spodumene
Feldspar (albite and microcline) exists as coarse primary 
grains and fine secondary veins in the spodumene samples examined. The effect of calcination on coarse-grained and 
vein feldspar/mica in cross-sections of sample BH1300 
is shown in Figure 130. In all calcined samples heated above 1050  °C, coarse feldspar, present as inclusions in spodumene, appear as fractured particles. In the example 
shown in Figure 130a, feldspar occurs as albite and 
orthoclase. Clear contacts across boundaries indicate no interaction of feldspar with calcined spodumene. In mica (K, Mg, Na-rich) and Ba-rich feldspar veins, the mica has altered to an amorphous melt phase with relict feldspar (Fig. 130b).
Feldspar is observed to undergo partial melting over a large 
temperature interval (1060  °C to 1200  °C) that overlaps spodumene transformation. Studies reported by Peltosaari 
et al. (2015) observed particle agglomeration in spodumene 
concentrates from the partial melting of gangue-based alkali-feldspar at temperatures above 1025 °C. In the temperature range (950–1100 °C) observed in this study, feldspar appears to only have fractured with no obvious 
melted phase. This is probably due to slow heat transfer 
through the coarse particles used in these tests and the slow heating rate. It has been reported that increasing the heating rate increases the melting point of feldspars, but 
also increases the rate of melting (Johnson and McCauley, 
2005). Hence, if calcination temperature can be suitably controlled, the effect of feldspar melting can be mitigated. Like micas, melted feldspars would contribute to the formation of clinker in furnaces.Al O2 3SiO2

Wells et al.Exsolution and oxidation of iron from 
calcined spodumene 
As observed in the laser ablation data earlier, the Fe content 
of α-spodumene examined in this study varied between 500 and 4000  ppm. Surface imaging of calcined Fe-rich 
spodumene, such as the MC300 sample, revealed finely 
disseminated (≤5 µm), roundish grains associated with ‘holes’ in the former, calcined spodumene. EBSD analysis reveals the Fe-oxide particles have a hematite structure attached to the 
edge of β-spodumene (Fig. 131–1). The BSE image shows 
evidence of exsolution, migration and cementation of Fe-oxide grains where high, BSE contrast, vein-like structures within β-spodumene can be observed to develop and congregate into grains (Fig. 131– 2). It is inferred that during calcination 
ferrous ions present in monoclinic α-spodumene are exsolved and oxidize to a ferric oxide (hematite) phase during the conversion to tetragonal β-spodumene.
Quartz in calcined spodumene
Quartz undergoes an α–β crystal inversion at 573  °C (Schelz, 1976). Interactions of α–β quartz conversions and α-spodumene reactions have been observed in rapid 
heating tests in fine particles (Abdullah, et al., 2019). In this 
study, quartz appeared fractured but no real interaction between quartz and spodumene transformation was observed in the coarse particles examined and temperature 
range of experiments. Calcination of other gangue minerals
Depending upon the efficiency of the concentrator during 
the beneficiation step, spodumene concentrates can also contain other unwanted gangue materials, including country 
rock (e.g. basalts containing amphiboles, calcium-rich 
feldspar and biotite).

Wells et al.Samples of country rock heated under conditions favourable 
for the transformation of α-spodumene to β-spodumene are shown in Figure 132. While minerals present in the samples 
appear to have undergone significant change, the overall 
rock particles appear to remain intact. Hence, providing the temperature range in the furnace is controlled to around the spodumene α–β transformation temperature, the impact of 
country rock materials may be minimal.
Pollucite is reported to be stable up to 1400  °C (Vance 
et al., 1981). Figure 133 illustrates pollucite observed in Greenbushes samples remains unaltered and stable under 
the calcine conditions. Hence, it will report as pollucite to the 
acid-bake leach step.
Table 17 shows the mineral transformation of other minerals 
observed in pegmatite ores at different temperatures. With 
the exception of apatite and pollucite, all other phases have decomposition temperatures below that of the optimum α–β spodumene calcined temperature.
Lithium extractability of different 
lithologies by conventional calcination and sulphate-roasting method
A two-stage calcination — sulphate-roast testing procedure 
was used to simulate and assess the Li-extraction process for ores with different lithologies.
Key findings
Factors identified that affect the extraction of lithium from the samples evaluated are as follows:
•	Mica melt encapsulation of the spodumene grains 
prevents lithium extraction.
•	Slow rate of diffusion of acid into large particles to 
facilitate lithium extraction.
•	Potentially insufficient acid for dissolution of lithium and other acid soluble phases.
•	Incomplete conversion of γ-spodumene to β-spodumene during calcination may have contributed to poor lithium 
extraction during the acid-baked and water-leaching stage.Sample selection 
Eight samples from those illustrated in Table 9 were selected 
to study and compare the calcination and leaching properties of different pegmatite ores. The mineral abundance of 
samples chosen for this study are shown in Figure 134. The 
samples show a range of common mineral impurities in addition to the main Li-bearing mineral spodumene.
The samples were treated as received, without any upgrade to 
allow the determination of the effect of gangue minerals have 
on the calcination and sulphate baking process, as well as the 
liberation and extraction of lithium from spodumene.
Calcination and sulphate roasting for lithium 
recovery methodology 
Figure 135 outlines the test procedure used for evaluating 
lithium recovery.
Selected samples from different deposits with different 
lithologies were examined in the following way:
•	Calcination  — Approximately 250  g of sample (particle 
size 1–4 mm) on a flat ceramic plate was placed directly 
in a muffle furnace set at 1100 °C. The timer was started once the furnace had equilibrated to 1100 °C. After two 
hours, the calcined sample was removed and left to cool under ambient conditions. 
•	Sulphate roasting — Calcined samples were acid baked 
according to the optimum conditions observed in a 
study involving feed from Greenbushes and reported by Salakjani et al. (2019). The acid dosage was set to 180% of the stoichiometric acid dosage (0.9 mol H
2SO4/
mol Li) based on the Li grade of the sample with the highest grade, which equated to 46.5 g acid per 100 g ore. 
Samples were baked at 250 °C for one hour. Acid bakes 
were carried out in two batches of six. Approximately 18 g of Li concentrate was added to each crucible, followed by ~8.4  g of concentrated sulphuric acid. The concentrate 
and acid mixture were mixed for around 30 seconds with 
a glass rod. The samples were not ground. The crucibles were inserted into the furnace over the span of around five minutes and the timer started once the last sample had been inserted. After one hour, the crucibles were removed 
and allowed to cool for 20 minutes.

GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western Australia•	Lithium extraction  — Water leaching was carried out at 
50 °C for two hours, with leaching commencing 30 minutes 
after the crucibles had been removed from the calcination 
furnace. A mass of 20–25 g of baked concentrate (all that 
could be removed from the crucible) was added to 100 mL 
of deionized water in a 250-mL conical flask and placed 
in a water bath/shaker set to 50 °C for two hours. As with 
the acid-bake treatments, leaching was carried out in two 
batches of six, with leaching commencing 30 minutes after 
the removal of the baked samples from the furnace.
Both sulphate roasting and leaching were carried out 
using Murdoch University facilities under the supervision 
of Prof Alek Nikoloski. Polished mounts of samples before 
and following treatment were produced and examined 
for textural, compositional and mineralogical changes. 
Compositional and structural changes in minerals were 
evaluated using a combination of TIMA, XRPD and FIB-SEM 
with ToF–SIMS instruments.
Comparison of the calcination properties of 
different deposits
Figures 136 to 139 show images of untreated and calcined 
sample grains, together with XRPD patterns and BSE 
micrographs of calcined particle cross-sections for the 
different orebody samples.
Figure 136 shows the effect of calcination of an unaltered 
spodumene (MC200) and partially altered spodumene (MC500) from Mt Cattlin following heating to 1100 °C. The white, unaltered spodumene (MC200) yielded a chalky, friable, white product, whereas the greenish, partially altered 
spodumene (MC500) produced a brown product. Quartz 
present in the sample remains white. Muscovite present in 
the altered spodumene sample is also a brownish colour. 
XRD studies reveal around 80% of α-spodumene was converted to β-spodumene, with the balance converted to �-spodumene. The BSE micrograph of cross-sections of 
grains shows that the calcined spodumene particles have 
uniformly porous textures, with expansion cracks associated 
with expansion of spodumene from calcination. The mica 
associated with the partially altered spodumene (MC500) 
has decomposed to a melt structure similar to that shown in the section Partial melting of mica in calcined spodumene and altered spodumene. Albite present in sample MC500 has partially melted.The calcination of Bald Hill unaltered spodumene (BH1300) 
and partially altered spodumene (BH1480) resulted in the 
samples exhibiting similar products and textures as the Mt 
Cattlin samples (Fig. 137). However, the BH1480 sample that contains feldspar and micas, as well as the Li-, Mn-phosphate mineral (sicklerite), show dark-brown and black calcined grains, in addition to the chalky, friable, white product. The 
dark-brown and black calcined grains are associated with 
the highly exothermic oxidation of Fe within gangue minerals during calcination, to produce a burnt texture (Fig. 137). The BSE micrographs of cross-sections of calcined grains 
reveals the presence of iron oxide (bright areas covering 
grain surface) and melts from the decomposition of mica. XRPD show most of the spodumene on both samples was converted to β-spodumene. Mica present in both samples has decomposed.
The Pilgangoora sample (PD005), presented in Figure 138, 
reveals that the calcination of the white, lime-hued, unaltered spodumene produced a brownish chalky, friable product. XRPD results indicate that 86% of the α-spodumene was converted to β-spodumene, with the balance present as 
ɣ-spodumene (14%). Feldspar minerals and quartz appear 
fractured. Calcination of particles containing fine intergrowths 
of quartz and spodumene show no obvious interaction between the two minerals. This is consistent with earlier 
findings.
Figure 139 shows that the calcination of the Greenbushes 
samples (C1100P , C3300HWH and C3300HP), consisting mainly of white spodumene and quartz, produced white powdered products, which appeared less friable (when pinched between fingers) than those observed in the calcined 
products of other samples. The XRPD results revealed that, in 
contrast to other samples, only about 58% of the spodumene converted to β-spodumene, with the rest as γ-spodumene. This is despite the Greenbushes samples being heated under 
the same temperature for the same period of time as the 
other samples. Incomplete conversion of γ-spodumene to β-spodumene during calcination has been contributed to poor lithium extraction during the acid bake and water leaching stage (Dessemond et al., 2020).Calcination

GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western AustraliaEffect of calcination time on spodumene 
product 
To assess the differences between the spodumene 
conversion rates between Greenbushes and the other samples, tests were carried out over a time series to 
establish the length of time required to convert most of the 
α-spodumene to β-spodumene. A run was conducted on a Mt Cattlin sample along with a Greenbushes sample as a control sample for comparison. 
Figure 140 shows a graph of the change in mineralogy with 
heating time for the main phases present in Greenbushes 
and Mt Cattlin samples heated to 1100  °C over a period of three hours. A plot of the β-spodumene conversion rate expressed as β/(β+ ɣ)% with time is also presented. Rapid 
conversion of α-spodumene to ɣ-spodumene occurred in 
both samples within the first half an hour. However, the conversion from ɣ-spodumene to β-spodumene appeared 
to be delayed in the Greenbushes sample, similar to that observed in section, Comparison of the calcination 
properties of different deposits. It is not until after three 
hours that the majority of the spodumene (~90%) converts to the β-form. Whereas in the Mt Cattlin sample, the majority of the spodumene is converted to β-spodumene after around two hours. 
The reason for the difference in the Greenbushes is 
uncertain but may be related to the insulating properties 
of the high quartz content (44  J/molK) over spodumene (160  J/molK). In addition, the slower conversion rate of Greenbushes samples is probably related to the lower Fe 
content within spodumene that would provide an additional 
insulating effect compared with the other spodumene samples.
Calcination of concentrates
Four concentrate samples obtained from different mine sites were subjected to the same calcination process as the individual samples above. The composition and 
mineral association of these concentrates were illustrated 
in the concentrate liberation analysis section in section, Liberation characteristics-concentrates. As indicated earlier, spodumene in the Greenbushes concentrate is largely 
liberated, whereas the other concentrates have about 5% of 
spodumene interlocked with gangue minerals (mica, quartz and feldspar).
Figure 141 shows BSE micrographs, mineral maps, 
K–K and Al–K elemental maps of calcined concentrate samples, together with XRD patterns showing spodumene 
converted to β-spodumene. The calcined spodumene in 
the concentrates show similar texture and features as those observed in the sample specimens. In particular, the Mt Cattlin and Bald Hill concentrate samples have melt 
structures associated with decomposition and partial 
melting of contained mica and feldspar, respectively. The Greenbushes concentrate is finer grained than the other concentrates and appears well liberated with a porous calcined product.
Sulphate roast and lithium extraction
The eight calcined samples and four calcined spodumene concentrates described above were acid baked at 250 °C.  In the acid-bake process, concentrated sulphuric acid is mixed with dry lithium concentrate and heated, forming lithium sulphate as proposed in the following reaction (Salakjani  et al., 2019).

Wells et al.Lithium sulphate readily dissolves in water, with a solubility 
of 34.2 g/100 g of water at 25 °C (CRC, 2005).
The lithium was extracted in a water-leach stage and the 
residues washed and dried for chemical and mineralogical analyses following the methodology outlined in section, 
Calcination and sulphate roasting for lithium recovery 
methodology.
Effect of lithology and ore deposit on lithium 
extraction
Figure 142 shows the extraction of Li and Al for each of the 
samples and concentrates. The extraction of Li appears related to the extraction of some of the Al. The impact of Al dissolution on Li extraction is discussed later. The 
moderate content of lithium in the washings illustrate the 
importance of ensuring samples are washed sufficiently to prevent loss of lithium.
For Pilgangoora, Bald Hill and Mt Cattlin samples, 
lithium extraction can be considered a function of the mineral impurities associated within these samples. High 
mineral impurity contents yield a poorer extraction. The 
concentrates (Aconc, BHconc and Gcon) and BH1300 and MC200 have high lithium extractions and <5% 
mineral impurity content to interfere with the spodumene 
conversion and leaching processes. Samples PD005, BH1480 and MC500 contain a moderate to high gangue content, which clearly affected lithium extraction. Studies 
reported in the literature have indicated that lithium 
extraction decreases with the impurity content in the feed (Lajoie-Leroux et al 2018; Yelatontsev and Mukhachev, 
2021). In contrast, Greenbushes samples appear to have a low lithium extraction, with low mineral impurity content. 
Figure 143 shows that lithium extraction is not completely dependent on having full conversion of α-spodumene via ɣ-spodumene to β-spodumene, with the β/(β+ ɣ) ratio 
varying between 60 and 100%. As discussed in section Effect of calcination time on spodumene product, the 
slow rate of conversion to β-spodumene has possibly 
affected the efficiency of lithium extraction, and would 
likely be ameliorated through finer grinding, similar to the 
Greenbushes concentrate (Tconc).
Relationship of lithium extraction to impurity 
contents
The chemical composition of both uncalcined solids and 
the calcined acid-bake and water-leach residues is shown in Figure 144. The chemical composition of the filtrate and washing solutions are shown in Figure 145. The raw data 
are presented in Appendix 8.
In the uncalcined samples (Fig. 144a), the Li content 
ranges from 1.7  wt% for a sample with high impurities 
to 3 – 3.5 wt% with relatively low levels of impurity. The majority of the samples are made up of Al and Si, with high 
Si contents associated high quartz content. Iron and Mn are 
prominent in seven of the samples, largely associated with spodumene and micas as discussed earlier. One exception 
is BH1480, which contains sicklerite. Sample BH1480 also 
contains a high impurity content (~10 wt%) due to the high mica content. The Greenbushes samples and MC200 have only trace amounts of elemental impurities. Samples 
MC500 and BH1300, although with a high Li grade of >3%, have ~3  wt% of impurities associated with intergranular 
micas in the spodumene grains as illustrated in earlier 
studies.
Figure 144b shows that in the leached solid residue 
following calcination, acid baking and water leaching, the Li 
content is low (0.0 – 0.2 wt%) in nine of the samples. High 
Li content remains in the BH1480, C3300HP and C1100P 
samples (1 – 1.7 wt%) and moderate amounts of residual 
Li (0.2 – 0.4  wt%) in samples PD005 and C3300HWH. However, there appears to be no relationship between the quantity of mineral impurities and residual lithium 
content. This is probably due to differences in the thermal 
and leaching behaviour of the impurities in the different 
samples. The Greenbushes samples have a high quartz content, which should be relatively inert in the acid-bake treatment, whereas the other samples contain decomposed 
mica and phosphate minerals. Sample BH1480 has a high 
content of impurities in the solids compared with PD005, 
despite having similar quantities of mineral impurities. 
Mass loss from acid baking and water leaching was high 
(3 – 5 wt%) in the Mt Cattlin samples (MC200 and MC500) 
and the high-grade spodumene from Bald Hill (BH1300), 
as well as for all mine concentrates. In the Pilgangoora 
sample (PD005) and Greenbushes samples (C300HP , C3300HWH and C1100P), the mass loss was low (0.5 and 2 wt%, respectively). Mass loss is associated with 
the dissolution of reactive, calcined minerals (e.g. calcium 
oxide and phosphate dissolution in sulphuric acid). Notably, 
Fe is detected in all residue samples and is concentrated following the acid-bake and water-leaching process. Mass loss of all concentrates was high compared with the 
majority of the other samples at around 4 wt%. This reflects 
the dehydroxylation of some of the mineral impurities 
associated with these samples during calcination.
Figure 145a shows the elemental content of the filtrate 
solution expressed as a weight percentage of the sample 
following the water leach of the acid-bake materials. 
Lithium in solution follows roughly the reverse trend of 
the leached solid residues (i.e. high Li in solution, low Li 
in solids). The samples with a greater impurity content 
mirror the mass loss illustrated in Figure 144. Dissolution 
of Na and Al is prevalent in all samples. As indicated earlier, 
dissolution of some Al is related to Li dissolution from 
spodumene. Iron dissolution is associated with samples containing high Fe content in spodumene and micas, with the Greenbushes samples having the least amount 
of Fe. Calcium and P dissolution is prevalent in BH1480, 
MC200 and in concentrate samples associated with acid 
dissolution of apatite, while sicklerite (Li(MnFe)PO
4) in 
sample BH1480 also contributing to elevated Mn and Fe 
concentrations. The Greenbushes samples had the lowest 
level of impurities in solution (~0.3 wt% of sample or total 
impurity content 500  mg/L in solution) compared with 
other ores (~1 to 2 wt% of sample or 1500 to 3000 mg/L), reflecting the relative purity of the sample comprising only spodumene and quartz. The concentrates appear to have a high Al, Na and Fe contents in solution. These concentrates are finer in particles size than the other samples, which make some of the gangue material more reactive to acid 
dissolution.
The chemical composition of the washing solution 
expressed as a weight percentage of the sample where the filter residue was washed in water is shown in Figure 
145b. Similar trends in the solution composition to the 143

Morphology and deportment of lithium in acid-
baked water-leached residues
The deportment of lithium in acid-baked residues and 
associated grain morphology, as well as their chemical composition, was examined in cross-sections of particles 
to determine the properties favourable for lithium extraction 
in the different samples. 
Figures 146 and 147 show BSE images of cross-sectioned 
grains of calcined spodumene after acid baking and water leaching of the Bald Hill sample (BH1480), together with 
ToF-SIMS elemental maps of major cations.
In Figure 146, the ToF-SIMS scans reveal that an 
amorphous glass phase (regions of high K, Na, and Rb) has formed a partial encapsulation coating around calcined spodumene. The glassy texture is interpreted as the product of partial melting of contained mica. The 
glass phase acts to reduce the efficiency of Li extraction 
during the acid-baking and water-leaching stage. The results demonstrate that sulphuric acid used in the baking stage does not dissolve the mica melt which coats the 
calcined spodumene grains. The second set of data shows 
the presence of Fe- and Mn-oxide grains (Fe- and Mn-enriched areas in ToF-SIMS analysis), which formed by the oxidation of Fe and Mn within the melted mica, during initial calcination. Areas enriched in lithium are also encapsulated 
by melt media containing Na and K from the decomposition 
of micas.
Figure 147 a and b show BSE images of the cross-sections 
of two spodumene grains, with accompanying ToF-SIMS Li and Al maps. The cross-section of particles of acid-baked, 
calcined spodumene have flat, fractured textures, which are 
common and observed for all calcined spodumene grains that have undergone acid-bake treatment. During the acid baking and subsequent water leaching, the amount of lithium extracted from acid-baked particles varied. In Figure 
147a, the majority of lithiium was leached from the particle, 
whereas Figure 147b shows the partial dissolution of lithium within the particle. Notably, in areas where the  Li is depleted, the Al concentration (green vs yellow colouration 
representing different concentrations in the ToF-SIMS Al 
map) was also depleted, indicating some dissolution and loss of Al, as depicted in the correlation between Li and Al dissolution in the leaching data (see Fig. 143).
Figure 148 shows the cross-sections of particles from 
the Greenbushes sample illustrating similar textures 
and lithium deportment following acid baking and water 
leaching as described above on part of a coarse particle (~250 µm) and a fine particle (~40 µm). 
Close examination of the particles at higher resolution (Fig. 
148b) reveals a ‘white-ant wood’ textured framework and 
rippled structures in areas barren in lithium, compared to 
Li-rich areas where the particles have a smoother texture. While lithium extraction is considered an ion exchange process, where hydrogen ions replace Li in the residual 
calcined spodumene structural matrix (Salakjani, et al., 2016; Han et al, 2018), a proportion of Al is also removed 
during the sulphuric acid baking and water leaching, which 
causes shrinkage of the residual mineral particles. The 
displacement of Al occurring to liberate and extract Li suggests that the direct ion exchange mechanism of Li
+ 
for H+ following acid baking, as illustrated in the equation 
above, is non-unique.
The agglomeration and shrinkage of particle grains 
observed in these tests may impede full extraction within 
the particles. To facilitate efficient extraction of lithium, the 
calcined particles for acid-bake leaching need to be ground fine enough to allow diffusion and leaching of lithium from within the particles.148

Processing trends in WA LCT 
pegmatites examined in this study
A comparison between pegmatite ore types and the 
processing options that are either currently used or are 
reported as suitable for processing WA pegmatite type 
ores examined in this study is shown in Table 18. Mines at Pilgangoora, Greenbushes, Mt Cattlin, Mt Marion and Bald 
Hill have been established with beneficiation process plants 
producing spodumene concentrates. Information about their 
process plants is provided in Table 18, where possible. 
Beneficiation 
Although many of the processing details are not fully published, in general terms the beneficiation process 
flowsheets can be categorized as one of three types:
1. A  heavy media separation circuit
2. Combined hea vy media separation and flotation circuit
3. Whole of or e flotation circuit.
The treatment of Kathleen Valley ore is currently at the final 
investment decision (FID) stage for the development of 
the mine and process plant by Liontown Resources. Other 
deposits listed, such as Londonderry, Pioneer Dome, Sinclair 
and Dalgaranga, are mainly in the exploration stage, with 
some metallurgical test work in progress by the respective 
companies.
Based on the ore types and process plant configurations, 
the different mines can be categorized into groups that have 
similar ore properties and processing routes as shown by different colour shades in Table 18 as follows:
•	LCT albite–spodumene pegmatite, LCT complex 
spodumene pegmatite:  High quartz and feldspar, with 
moderately sized spodumene pegmatites — staged crushing incorporating high-pressure grinding rollers (HPGR), production of coarse concentrate by DMS and a fine concentrate by flotation with no DMS circuit 
(Pilgangoora, Mt Marion and Kathleen Valley).
•	LCT albite–spodumene pegmatite: Quartz, feldspar, 
with high mica content and coarse to very coarse 
spodumene pegmatite — staged crushing and liberation 
of spodumene and concentration with staged DMS cyclone configuration (Bald Hill, Mt Cattlin).
•	LCT complex spodumene pegmatite:  Quartz with 
moderate to fine spodumene pegmatite — staged 
crushing and grinding followed by DMS and flotation to 
generate concentrates (Greenbushes).
•	LCT albite pegmatite:  Zinnwaldite, albite, quartz 
pegmatite — primary crushing semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) or rod mill followed by magnetic separation to generate concentrate (Dalgaranga).
•	LCT complex petalite pegmatite:  Petalite zoned with 
feldspar and quartz pegmatite — excavation, crushing and grinding to produce direct shipping ore (DSO) (Londonderry and Pioneer Dome).In the Pilgangoora samples examined in this study, coarse 
tabular spodumene is the main Li-source and hosted within 
a quartz and feldspar matrix. As observed in the liberation 
studies (refer to the section Liberation characteristics of spodumene), high spodumene recoveries are possible. 
However, processing of spodumene associated with fine, 
graphitic textured intergrowth with quartz and feldspars, 
and some spodumene–mica alteration zones will lead to 
reduced recoveries. The two flow sheets available for the 
Pilgangoora region are from Pilbara Minerals and Altura Resources’ plants (now owned by Pilbara Minerals). Both 
Pilbara Minerals and the Altura concentrator plants are 
designed for processing ore feed from opposite sides of 
the same pegmatite ore deposit. However, only the Pilbara Minerals Deposit is considered enriched with Ta. Both 
plants are of similar design and consist of crushing, feed 
preparation, DMS, gravity separation, grinding, flotation, 
magnetic separation and dewatering. The Pilbara Mineral’s 
plant has spirals after the milling circuit to recover tantalite. 
During operation of the Altura plant, the ore from the ROM pad was crushed to 28 mm through a closed crushing circuit 
utilizing a primary jaw crusher, secondary cone crusher and 
dry vibrating screen. The –28 mm material was stockpiled 
to delink the crushing circuit from the remainder of the plant. 
The ore was then crushed with HPGR to reduce the particle 
size to –6 mm and wet screened to a 6 x 1 mm DMS feed and –1  mm fines fraction. Mica was removed from the 
DMS feed via a classifier prior to a two-stage DMS plant 
producing a high density, on-grade spodumene product, 
medium-density middlings and low-density reject streams. The –1 mm fines from the HPGR were subjected to further 
classification to remove mica prior to further processing. 
Middlings from the DMS and pre-concentrated fines report 
to a closed-circuit, ball mill to reduce the particle size to a 
P80 of 106 µm. The milled ore was de-slimed by removing 
the –20 µm fines before reporting to the flotation circuit. A rougher cleaner and recleaner circuit upgraded the fines to 
an on-grade +6% Li
2O concentrate. The flotation concentrate 
was subject to high intensity, magnetic separation to 
reduce Fe levels in the concentrate. The fine concentrate was de-watered and stockpiled for blending with the coarse concentrate before shipping. A similar type of plant configuration to the Altura plant has been developed by Covalent Lithium in treating ores from Mt Holland, which 
contain mineralogical domains consisting of spodumene, 
petalite, mixed spodumene–petalite, alteration (cookeite), 
and barren albite zones.
The Greenbushes ore is a high-grade ore consisting of a 
mixture of spodumene and quartz (section Greenbushes). 
Greenbushes has three processing plants: one producing 
technical grade, see section, Greenbushes samples, 
Li concentrates and two producing chemical-grade Li 
concentrate. Ore containing Li
2O is fed into the processing 
plants, which upgrades the lithium using gravity, heavy 
media, flotation and magnetic processes to produce a range 
of lithium concentrates for bulk and bagged shipments. The 
process employs a crushing and grinding circuit, followed by screening to separate coarse and fine particles. The fine 
fraction is de-slimed, conditioned and treated through a 
flotation circuit to produce a concentrate. The concentrate is 
treated through gravity separation and magnetic separation 
steps to remove heavy minerals and tourmaline to produce 
a spodumene concentrate. Concentrate produced from this plant feeds the Talison lithium refinery plant at Kwinana 
in Western Australia. As illustrated in liberation studies  GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western Australia151Table 18.  Or e and process characteristics of pegmatites examined in this study

Wells et al.(refer to section, Liberation characteristics of spodumene), 
fine grinding would be required to liberate spodumene associated with graphitic textural intergrowths with quartz 
and feldspar.
The Mt Cattlin and Bald Hill ores are characteristic of high-
grade, white spodumene in quartz, feldspar and muscovite 
zones, transitioning to low-grade, highly altered green to dark-
green spodumene present in a quartz and feldspar matrix. The mineralization of spodumene is fairly coarse (metre to coarse 
centimetre in length) compared with the other deposits, which 
make it conducive to produce only a coarse concentrate using DMS circuits. As illustrated in this study, Fe-, Mn- and Mg-enriched micas exist in several forms as fine interstitial veins 
in voids and fractures, as coarse inclusions within spodumene 
grains and as complex alteration zones within spodumene 
grains, see section Bald Hill. 
Both concentrate plants have similar process configurations 
and consist of staged crushing with jaw and cone crushers, 
although the crushed size reporting to the concentrator 
circuit varies between the two plants (+14 and +18 mm). 
Ore sorting has recently been installed at Mt Cattlin to 
improve the quality of the feed going to the concentrator. 
The crushed ore is screened, and the underflow treated with 
spirals and shaking tables to recover the Ta product. In the 
Mt Cattlin circuit, the screen overflow is treated through a 
DMS cyclone circuit to produce spodumene concentrate. In 
the Bald Hill plant, the screen overflow is further screened 
and treated through a two-stage DMS circuit to produce a 
coarse spodumene concentrate. The fines are first treated 
through a classifier to remove slimes and mica before 
treatment through a two-stage DMS circuit to product a fine spodumene concentrate. 
The Londonderry and Pioneer Dome ores contain zones 
of massive petalite as illustrated in sections Dome North 
and Londonderry. Neither of these deposits are currently 
mined for lithium. Selected mining of the region may allow a simple excavation, crushing and grinding circuit 
targeted at these zones to yield a concentrate. However, 
processing of petalite in regions with coarse quartz, 
feldspar and mica associations would require a staged crushing circuit. As petalite has a similar density (ρ = 2.42 g.cm
-3) to most of the gangue material found in LCT 
pegmatites (i.e. quartz, ρ = 2.65 g.cm-3 and feldspar, ρ ≈ 
2.65 g.cm-3), the recovery of petalite cannot be carried out 
by DMS cyclone or other gravity type circuits and would 
require a flotation circuit configuration.
The Sinclair Deposit contains regions of petalite, lepidolite 
and spodumene, but it is mainly the Cs mineral pollucite 
which is of interest. Pollucite exists as a massive zone, with 
minimum impurity content (see section Sinclair Caesium 
Deposit), which allowed Pioneer Resources (now owned by Essential Metals) to recently mine and process pollucite as a 
DSO and only involved direct crushing and grinding to make 
a concentrate.
The Kathleen Valley Deposit is characterized by having 
medium to coarse spodumene as elongated laths that are associated with quartz and feldspars as described 
in section, Kathleen Valley. The proposed process will 
consist of a two-stage crushing circuit followed by SAG 
to produce a P80 180 µm feed to a flotation circuit. The 
crushing and grinding circuit feeds a gravity circuit to 
produce a Ta concentrate. The SAG mill will accommodate the initial base production of 2.5 Mt/a, and the planned 
expansion to 4  Mtpa in the sixth year of the mine plan. 
Magnetic separation is used to reduce the Fe level (by 55%). 
A flotation circuit will be used to concentrate spodumene. The circuit differs from the Pilgangoora plants in that no 
DMS circuit is used. Both pre-feasibility study (PFS) and 
DFS indicated better recoveries (80%) and grade (>6% Li
2O) were obtained by a direct flotation route rather than 
involving a DMS circuit (Liontown presentation 2020, 
Liontown ASX announcement 11 Nov 2021).
The Mt Marion Deposit is characterized by spodumene 
associated with quartz, muscovite and albite (see section Mt Marion). The process plant consists of a three-stage crushing and HPGR circuit. The ground product is screened to produce a coarse (+1 mm) and fine (<1 mm) fraction. Both 
streams are treated through reflux classifiers separately 
to remove mica and de-slime. The coarse feed is then processed through the primary DMC circuit to produce a 6% 
Li
2O grade spodumene concentrate. The coarse rejects are 
processed along with fine fraction through the secondary 
DMC circuit to produce a 4% Li2O grade spodumene 
concentrate.
The Dalgaranga Deposit contains the Li- and Fe-rich mica, 
zinnwaldite. No lithium has been mined at Dalgaranga. 
Treatment of zinnwaldite ores usually involve jaw crushing ROM followed by either rod milling or SAG milling to liberate the zinnwaldite. Beneficiation can be by wet high-
intensity magnetic separation (WHIMS) to separate out 
the Li-bearing micas (zinnwaldite) and produce a magnetic mica concentrate. The ability to use WHIMS is unique to 
zinnwaldite ore because zinnwaldite contains Fe in its 
lattice and is paramagnetic. The magnetic susceptibility of zinnwaldite is about 270 × 10−9 m
3kg−1 (Leißner et al., 
2016). Magnetic separation has been shown to be effective 
in separating zinnwaldite using a relatively broad magnetic 
induction range (3500–7200 × 10−4 Tesla) from Sn–W 
tailings in the Czech Republic (Botula et al., 2005). European 
Metals Ltd are proposing to recover zinnwaldite by magnetic 
separation in their plant development at Cinovec in the Czech Republic (European Metals ASX announcement, 2017).
Lithium refineries in Western Australia
As of the fourth quarter 2021, only Talison has built and commissioned a lithium refinery processing plant with a production nameplate of 48 000 tpa battery grade lithium 
hydroxide from Greenbushes spodumene concentrate at 
Kwinana. Covalent Lithium has commenced construction works at its Kwinana refinery site following approval from the 
WA Department of Water and Environmental Regulation. The 
refinery plan is to process ore from the Mt Holland mine to produce 50 000 tpa of lithium hydroxide, LiOH, over a 40-year project life, with production of battery-grade LiOH forecast for 2024. United States company Albemarle Corporation and 
its local partner, Mineral Resources, are also looking to build 
a 50 000 tpa refinery at Kemerton.
While full details of the refinery operations are not published, the refinery process normally consists of spodumene concentrate being heated in a rotary kiln to 1100 °C to convert α-spodumene to β-spodumene. The calcined 
product is then cooled and ground (74 to 150 µm) in a mill 
to break up the particles. The ball mill discharge is fed to an acid mixer where sulphuric acid is blended with the calcined 153
GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western Australiafeed. The blended acidic calcined mixture is fed to a second 
rotary kiln to undertake a sulphate roast at ~250  °C. The baked product is cooled and water leached to extract the 
lithium from the baked product. The pregnant lithium liquor 
is filtered from the baked residue and processed through a caustization step. 
Direct production of lithium hydroxide is preferred over 
lithium carbonate product in response to changes in 
requirement for EV battery materials. The impurities are 
removed by increasing the pH by the addition of series of bases to precipitate the impurities. Lime is used to increase the pH to remove Al and Fe from solution. Sodium carbonate is then added to remove Ca and Mg. The liquor is treated 
with 1.5 – 1.7-fold excess NaOH to increase solution pH. 
The solution is cooled to between –5 and 3°C for around 12 hours to form crystals of Glauber salt, Na
2SO4.10H2O. These 
crystals are removed by centrifuge and dried for disposal. The remaining solution is heated to evaporate water and 
crystallize LiOH.H
2O through a crystallizer. Several stages 
of dissolution and recrystallization are undertaken to further 
purify the product. 
Lithium refining to make LiOH from Mt Holland and Kathleen 
Valley ores is in the development stage. Pilbara Minerals is investigating options for treating their fines, which include using the Calix flash vertical kiln to calcine the fines and also investigating the use of the Liena™ process, a pressure 
alkaline approach developed by Lithium Australia and 
ANSTO. At this stage, most of the other mines are still processing ores to make a DSO concentrate. 
The treatment of petalite ores such as at Londonderry 
and Pioneer Dome follows a similar treatment process 
to that used for spodumene (Sitando and Crouse, 2012). 
For the treatment and extraction of Li from lithium mica ores, sulphate roasting is best undertaken with CaSO
4 
and Ca(OH)2, followed by water leaching. Zinnwaldite 
decomposes into Ca3Fe2(SiO4)3, Ca(Al2Si2O8), Ca4Si2O7F2, and 
traces of CaF2. In this process, F is fixed by the formation 
of F-containing compounds to prevent HF formation. Other processes such as the SiLeach and L-Max Technology have 
been tested on pilot scale to recover Li from micas (e.g. 
lepidolite). The halogen-based SiLeach process uses the addition of ground fluoride minerals followed by sulphuric acid to process slurry to generate F
- in solution and 
preferentially react with silicates without any accumulation of HF in the slurry (Griffin, 2017). A 6  kg/h pilot plant 
campaign reported lithium extractions of 95%. Lepidico Ltd 
have also tested their atmospheric process on a high-grade, Li mica concentrate to yield Li recoveries greater than 80% and following purification steps claim to produce >99.88% 
Li
2CO3 (lepidico.com, 2017).
Comparison with other orebodies 
Granite pegmatite deposits around the world, where lithium 
mineralization is mostly hosted by the mineral spodumene, tend to have similar process plant designs as illustrated 
in this report for the Australian industry. Processing of  
Li-bearing pegmatites involves three-stage crushing (primary 
jaw, secondary cone and tertiary HPGR), DMS to produce a spodumene concentrate and gravity concentration to 
produce separate Sn and Ta concentrates. As illustrated in 
Figure 3 many of the world deposits are small in comparison with those present in Australia.Process implications
Key mineralogical factors that are important in selecting a processing option for Li ores are:
•	Lithium mineral host and impurities (Fe, Mn) within the 
mineral structure
•	Size of mineral host
•	Mineral assemblage, texture and associations with the Li-host mineral.
While orebody and stakeholders can influence the design, increasingly environmental and social governance factors are also becoming important in considering options for processing orebodies. There are several publications which 
have broadly reviewed the beneficiation and extraction 
processing of Li-bearing minerals (Grammatikopoulos et al., 2009; Meshram et al., 2014; Tran and Luong, 2015; Tadesse et al., 2019; Karrech et al., 2020, Li et al., 2019; Welham, 2019; 
Gibson et al., 2021). Details of plant design for individual 
plants are limited in reported PFS and DFS. A summary of the major issues and impediments of processing of  lithium WA ores are listed in Table 19. Specific details of equipment used to treat ores are outlined in the following sections.
Crushing and grinding 
The crushing circuits of albite–quartz–feldspar pegmatite ores containing spodumene in Western Australia is generally undertaken using open-circuit primary and closed-circuit 
secondary crushing. 
Tertiary and quaternary crushers are used for ores that need 
to undergo physical separation, whereas primary crushing 
followed by SAG milling is used in circuits where the feed goes directly to flotation (Welham, 2019).
Where crushing and dry screening are used, a coarse particle 
size is favoured. Spodumene pegmatite ores are generally 
hard (unconfined compressive strength index ~150  MPa) and abrasive (abrasive index ~0.5). The crushing work index of around 15  kWh/t (10–18  kWh/t) typifies moderately 
hard crushing duties, with ball mill work indexes ranging 
from 11 kwh/t for coarse product to 20.4  kWh/t for fine P
80, ~150 µm products. SAG mill comminution test work 
data reported for the Kathleen Valley Deposit showed high competency (A x b) values of 55.8 to 65.8, which leads to 
Liontown favouring SAG milling over staged comminution 
processes used by other process plants. Apart from higher power consumption, finer crushing requires high-circulating loads, which causes high-liner wear and consequent 
increased downtime for maintenance. In addition, finer 
size screening can result in screen pegging and blinding, especially in ores containing a high mica content. Coarse feed can also improve screening efficiencies in downstream DMS circuits. The coarse nature of spodumene in Western 
Australian ores has allowed companies to favour coarse 
product sizes (4 to 18 mm).
Overgrinding of ores containing micaceous material can 
result in preferential sliming of mica, which presents a problem when fed to the beneficiation circuit. To reduce 
overgrinding, a classifier and screening prior to milling is 
recommended.GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western Australia154Aspects Issues Impediments Potential solutions

GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western AustraliaFor ores that predominantly consist of Li-mica, a primary 
crushing process followed by rod or SAG milling to liberate the mica is favoured as this reduces the sliming of mica. 
This type of process could be used to process zinnwaldite 
at Dalgaranga and possibly the Li-mica at Lepidolite Hill  
(a predominantly lepidolite ore) near Mt Marion.
HPGR have been successfully used to reduce feed to 
appropriate size (3–6  mm) for downstream processing 
via techniques such as DMS and cyclone process. HPGR 
can reduce the complexity of the crushing circuit allowing for reduced maintenance costs associated with wear life of liners, and less downtime compared with conventional crushing processes. However, HPGR can produce a high 
content of fines, which can be reduced by choosing a 
coarse crush size and suitable process downstream for treating fines (Daniel et al., 2019). The use of HPGR has been implemented in the process flowsheet for ores from 
Pilgangoora and Mt Marion. 
Electrodynamic fragmentation (EDF), electrical pulse 
disaggregation, high-voltage pulse disaggregation, or ‘Selfrag’ processing techniques can be used as an alternative to conventional comminution techniques to enhance mineral 
liberation in various metallurgical applications. As applied 
to a zinnwaldite ore, EDF and traditional comminution size reduction yielded similar locking and liberation characteristics (Sandmann and Gutzmer, 2013). The integrated use of EDF and optical sorting as a combined 
method to enrich Li minerals has been examined and 
achieved selective liberation of spodumene and several of the gangue mineral components from a lithium pegmatite rock from Finland (Brandt and Haus, 2010). The EDF 
technique can reduce power consumption, allow breakage of 
particles at coarse size and produce fewer fines compared with standard crushing techniques. However, throughput on a large scale suitable for commercial scale production is limited. 
Beneficiation
Following the crushing stage, ores with a high Ta mineral content in the form of columbite–tantalite undergo a classification step to remove the high-density, heavy fraction 
that is treated to concentrate the Ta minerals through spirals 
and sometimes shaker tables. As illustrated in this report, Ta minerals in all deposits examined are mainly associated with the gangue minerals and can be freely liberated and treated 
separately from the spodumene concentrate.
During the crushing process of quartz–feldspar spodumene 
pegmatites, both a coarse and fine fraction are generated. Typically, DMS using cyclones for gravity separation is conducted on the 0.5 to 15 mm size fraction, with the undersize at <250  µm feeding a flotation circuit. In some 
cases, a middlings DMS product containing unliberated 
spodumene associated with silicate gangue is combined with the undersize to feed the flotation circuit. 
DMS can be an effective means to separate spodumene 
from lighter silicate minerals in a pre-concentration stage in 
hard rock operations. This has the benefit of less feed to the 
grinding and flotation circuits, achieving subsequent capital, energy and operating cost savings. The fines can either be discarded, stockpiled for future exploitation or treated 
through a flotation process. Spodumene has a specific gravity between 3.1 and 3.2 g.cm
-3,  
while quartz and feldspar have specific gravities between  
2.5 and 2.6 g.cm-3, whereas mica has a specific gravity 
between 2.8 and 3.0 g.cm-3. Hence, the separation of these 
minerals from spodumene by dense media is possible.
Factors that contribute to the efficiency of DMS in pegmatite 
minerals beneficiation are as follows: 
•	Degree of spodumene liberation at coarse particle sizes. 
Poor spodumene liberation yields significant lithium losses to the float product and negates economic justification for its use.
•	Due to the close relative densities, spodumene liberation must be high at larger particle sizes to minimize lithium 
losses. 
•	Fe-bearing silicates, such as amphibole, tend to have 
higher densities (2.9 – 3.2 g.cm
-3) and are, therefore, not 
separated from spodumene through DMS. Hence, this highlights the importance of removing country rock from 
the process.
•	The mineralogical transformation of spodumene to 
micaceous and clay minerals reduces the specific gravity (SG) of spodumene compared with its pure form and, as a result, there is effectively little difference in SG between 
the gangue minerals and spodumene. 
•	The spodumene behaves like micaceous and clay 
minerals in heavy media separation and, thus, its separation is affected. 
The limitations of DMS were shown in spodumene concentrates obtained from both Mt Cattlin and Bald Hill in 
this study, as shown in section Liberation characteristics – 
concentrates, where the presence of both country rock and mica was observed in high abundance. In recent times, ore sorting technology has been applied at Mt Cattlin to improve 
the feed to the DMS circuit. Using this technology, white and 
green spodumene can be distinguished optically from dark country rock and platy mica. The treatment of pegmatite zones with fine, graphic intergrowths of quartz and feldspar with spodumene (e.g. observed in some Pilgangoora 
samples tested) will also dilute the grade through DMS 
circuit and would need to be monitored during grade control.
Froth flotation is a technique which has been widely used 
in recent years for the beneficiation of spodumene (Gibson et al., 2017; Tadesse et al., 2019). Pre-treatment of Li-ores 
prior to flotation is an important step of the separation 
process to ‘clean’ or modify the surface of minerals before flotation. Reagents NaOH, Na
2S and NaF are used in the 
pre-treatment of Li-pegmatite ores (Moon and Fuerstenau, 2003; Yu et al., 2015a,b). The more weathered the material, 
the more cleaning is required for selective flotation. At the 
Kings Mountain operations in the US, cleaning of spodumene was conducted by the addition of NaOH to the grinding mill before it was fed to the flotation circuit (Redeker, 1981). 
Typically, the dosage of NaOH used for pre-treatment 
ranges from 0.5 to 2 kg/t and conditioning is conducted for 20–30 mins (Bulatovic, 2015). 
Anionic collectors such as oleic acid, sodium oleate, 
sulphonated and phosphorated fatty acids are widely 
utilized for the flotation of spodumene from pegmatite ores (Bulatovic, 2015). Spodumene recoveries of >90% and a 156
Wells et al.concentrate grade of 6.52% Li2O can be achieved with oleic 
acid. New collector mixtures have been tested (e.g. Xu et 
al., 2016), and the collector adsorption, pH, and isoelectric 
point that favours spodumene have been investigated in detail (Moon and Fuerstenau, 2003). Actual reagents used by 
several mine sites to float fine spodumene are confidential 
in nature. Several different collectors developed by Badische Anilin und Soda Fabrik are also available. Certain dissolved cations can affect spodumene flotation performance (Moon 
and Fuerstenau, 2003). Notably, both Ca
2+ and Fe3+ in the 
flotation pulp promotes spodumene activation. However, 
calcium hydroxide and ferric species are likely to precipitate on the surface of other silicate gangue minerals and spodumene surfaces, which can be the cause of concentrate 
grade dilution (Gibson et al., 2017). Therefore, process water 
chemistry is likely to have a significant effect on overall flotation performance of spodumene, an area that warrants 
further study.
Few studies exist on the flotation of lepidolite or petalite 
(Tadesse et al., 2019) and further studies on the mechanism of collector adsorption and the effects of activators and depressants are required for a better understanding. However, 
flotation has been used to separate mica from spodumene 
concentrate to improve spodumene grade in more complex ores in Canada (Gibson et al., 2017). In this example, a reverse 
silicate, gangue mineral flotation process is used to float mica 
and supress spodumene. Mica flotation is conducted in acidic pulp conditions (pH  2–2.5) using H
2SO4 as a pH modifier 
and an amine-based, cationic collector (Bulatovic, 2015). Petroleum sulphonate has also been used to float mica under acidic pulp conditions (Redeker, 1981). Mica pre-flotation offers the added benefit in removing Fe silicates and reducing the overall Fe content of the final spodumene concentrate. 
For ores with high zinnwaldite contents, beneficiation can 
be carried out on liberated grains by magnetic separation techniques, as mentioned earlier.
Magnetic separation is also frequently used to reject Fe-
bearing minerals so that the spodumene concentrate is 
suitable for use in ceramics and glass applications. The effectiveness of magnetic separation is related to particle 
dispersion in the feed (Jirestig and Forssberg, 1994).
Pretreatment calcination processing
The purpose of the calcination step is to convert refractory 
α-spodumene into β-spodumene, which is more amenable 
for extracting lithium from the calcined structure. Factors that 
affect the design and selection of the calcination process are the melting characteristics of the material at high temperature, 
the feed particle size distribution, abrasiveness and the ability 
to handle dust (Harman, 2019).
Calcination is conventionally carried out in a rotary kiln 
(Garrett, 2004). Rotary kilns have temperature gradients along the reactor length with the highest temperature in the flame zone of the burner (Gasafi and Pardemann, 2020). Hence, 
while the set temperature in the kiln is around 1100 °C, the 
temperature can exceed 1800 °C near the flame formed by the burner. The inhomogeneous axial and radial temperature distributions and varying residence time within the kiln, means that gangue materials that are associated with spodumene 
and with different thermal properties (i.e. different melting 
points) will have a significant effect on the performance of the calcination process. As illustrated in this study, the texture and appearance of 
calcined spodumene is related to the elemental and mineral 
impurities associated with the spodumene. Spodumene 
with high Fe and Mn content converts to β-spodumene at 
a slightly lower temperature. The exsolution of Fe and Mn 
from the spodumene structure during calcination results in fine Fe and Mn oxide particles providing there is sufficient oxygen in the furnace. It is important that Fe and Mn 
associated with spodumene and other minerals, such as 
mica, are fully oxidized during the calcination step; otherwise, 
high dissolution of these elements may be expected in the downstream leaching process. However, some control in the 
rate of heating and oxidation during the calcination process 
of high-Fe spodumenes (1–1.5  wt%) needs to be taken, as 
the highly exothermic nature of the oxidation of Fe during calcination causes the calcined spodumene to disintegrate 
into smaller particles. This can create issues with the 
management of finer particles in the acid-bake leach, and the 
filtering of solids to recover the liquor for recovering lithium 
from solution. 
As illustrated in this study, the decomposition of micaceous 
materials forming melts may result in the following problems:
•	Coating spodumene grains to render calcined spodumene 
refractory to lithium extraction during the sulphate-roasting and water-leaching step. The finer the particle 
size distribution the more serious the issue. 
•	Accumulation, agglomeration of particles and coating of 
melts in cooler zones along the furnace walls. This will 
lead to frequent maintenance shutdowns to remove layers 
of a glass-like phase (clinker) that accumulates during operation. 
As observed in the calcination studies, both primary and 
secondary forms of mica associated with spodumene undergo thermal decomposition at temperatures (<950  °C) 
below the spodumene transformation temperature. In 
particular, secondary micas (normally containing Mg, Fe, Na 
and K) have a recrystallization state that coincides with the spodumene transformation temperature range. 
Other gangue material, such as feldspar, can cause particle 
agglomeration in spodumene concentrates from the partial 
melting of alkali-feldspar at temperatures above 1025 °C. 
The coarse nature of feldspar, quartz and muscovite observed 
in spodumene concentrates examined in this study suggests 
they can potentially be liberated and removed by further 
treatment and upgrade of the concentrates. In concentrate 
samples examined in this report, liberated gangue particles 
of country rock materials and muscovite are evident and can 
easily be removed following a further cleaning separation 
stage or by ore sorting techniques. However, the fine 
integrated nature of micas associated within the alteration 
zone and those associated with fine fractures within 
spodumene are unlikely to be liberated without costly fine 
grinding and cleaning processes prior to treatment through 
the calcination process. Sintering needs to be avoided 
because leachability is reduced due to limiting access of the reagent to the β and γ-spodumene. 
Different pre-treatment options to reduce the refractive 
nature of spodumene to lithium extraction have been 
discussed in the literature (Salakjani et al., 2019). These 
have included microwave-assisted heating, flash calcination, mechanical activation and fluidized-bed calcination. A 157
GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western Australiageneral advantage of fluidized-bed over rotary kiln calcination 
is the establishment of a homogenous temperature profile in the reactor and more accurately controlled residence 
time (Gasafi and Pardemann, 2020). However, spodumene 
concentrates are very abrasive and need a narrow particle size range to operate in a fluidized-bed. Harman (2019) considered a tunnel furnace where material is batch loaded as a fixed 
bed into a large, long kiln and heated in the presence of a gas, 
which remove issues with abrasion, dust as well as allow regulation of temperature. 
Fines in the calciner feed stream tend to be elutriated out 
of the kiln with the off-gases, which tends to be unreacted α-spodumene (Harman, 2019). Unconverted spodumene is 
recycled back to the calciner feed, which reduces the overall 
capacity of the plant as the dust load increases in the kiln. Fine spodumene concentrates are also more susceptible to melting in kilns, causing blockages, and rendering the lithium 
unrecoverable. Furthermore, lower grade ores can contain 
other elements, which lower the melting point of spodumene leading to melting, fusing and blockages within the rotary kiln. Sodium, K and Fe are known to lower the melting point of spodumene. Calix have developed the BATMn reactor 
which has been tested on Pilbara Minerals and Greenbushes 
ore. The results are not published, but the process involves a fines-feed, flash-heated in an externally heated, vertical reactor (Calix.global.com). This reactor may provide a more 
suitable approach to calcining fine spodumene concentrate 
and low-grade ores containing high-gangue mineral content and reduce clinker effects.
Acid bake and water leaching
While there are many studies on alternative processes to extract lithium from spodumene, there have been very few attempts to improve the traditional process or to understand 
the causes behind its limitations. Approximate favoured 
conditions of 40% stoichiometric excess of H
2SO4, a 250 °C 
roasting temperature and 30-minute roasting duration have been determined by an orthogonal design of experiments 
(Tian et al., 2011). The test work conditions used in the 
current study were those designed by Murdoch University and are proven effective in maximizing lithium extraction from spodumene. The acid dosage was set to 180% of the 
stoichiometric acid dosage (0.9 mol H
2SO4/mol Li) for the 
reaction:
2LiAlSi2O6(s) +H2SO4 (l) →  2HAlSi2O6(s) + Li2SO4(s)
As shown in this study, incomplete lithium extraction can be 
limited by:
•	Mica melt encapsulation of spodumene grains preventing 
extraction of Li
•	Partial melting of feldspar minerals
•	Slow rate of diffusion of acid into calcined spodumene 
particles 
•	Potentially insufficient acid for dissolution of Li and other acid soluble phases
•	Incomplete conversion of γ-spodumene to β-spodumene during calcination may contribute to poor Li extraction 
during the acid-baked and water-leaching stage.Studies by Lajoie-Leroux et al. (2018) also indicated that 
lithium extraction decreases with the impurity content in the feed material and suggest that lithium recovery may be limited by the impurity coating of some β-spodumene particles.
While lithium extraction is considered an ion-exchange 
process, where hydrogen ions replace Li in the residual 
calcined spodumene structural matrix, a proportion of Al is also removed during the sulphuric acid-baking and water-leaching process that causes shrinkage of the mineral 
particles. The agglomeration and shrinkage of particle grains 
may impede full extraction from particles. Hence, the feed for acid baking needs to be ground fine enough to allow diffusion and leaching of lithium from within particles, but not too fine to cause sliming and blockages during solid–
liquid filtration step.
Lithium recovery
Recovery of lithium from liquors was not examined in 
this study. However, some inferences can be made from the water-leach studies. The current industry method of 
lithium recovery involves a purification step followed by 
crystallization steps to crystallize Li as a lithium-hydroxide 
product and a waste product of sodium sulphate separately (as described in section, Lithium refineries in Western Australia).
Chemical composition of liquors from the acid-baked and 
water-leach test in the current study showed elevated levels of Na, Al, Fe and Ca in solution. The Greenbushes samples had the lowest level of impurities in solution (500  mg/L) compared with other ores (1500 to 3000 mg/L), reflecting 
the low impurity content within spodumene, with unreactive 
quartz being the main mineral contaminant. The dissolution of minerals, such as apatite, with high-phosphate contents contributed to high-Ca and high-Mn yields in some solutions.
To recover Li as a lithium hydroxide product, impurities in 
the Li pregnant solution are precipitated out by increasing 
the pH. As the pH is increased, the solubility of the main contaminates (Fe, Al, Mn, Mg, Ca) decreases until they precipitate (Monhemius, 1977). The process is carried out in stages with Fe and Al being removed first by addition of 
lime. Hydrogen peroxide can be used to oxidize any ferrous 
ion to the less soluble ferric ion (Welham, 2019). Manganese, Ca and Mg are then precipitated at higher pH using sodium carbonate. Hence, reagent consumption at this stage will 
be governed by the concentration of these impurities in the 
acid-baked filtered solutions. 
Elements which are reported to be detrimental to battery 
production are halides (Cl, F and Br as potential powerful 
oxidizers), Na and K (impact cathode crystal formation) and base metals (Fe, Co, Ni and Cr as redox active metals) 
(Harman, 2019; Welham, 2019). 158
Wells et al.Other mineral recoveries
Other minerals and associated elements of significant 
interest are as follows:
•	Columbite — tantalite — Nb Ta
•	Cassiterite — Sn
•	Feldspars — high in Rb
•	Pollucite — Cs.
Processing to produce Ta concentrates is carried out in 
several existing plants as described above. The nature of 
the association of Ta minerals with gangue minerals over spodumene, as illustrated in this study, allows for separation and upgrading by gravity separation techniques to produce a concentrate separate to the spodumene concentrate. 
The association and fine dissemination of cassiterite 
within spodumene in many of these pegmatite deposits means some of the cassiterite will report to the spodumene concentrate. Hence, full recovery of cassiterite would need to consider all process streams. As coarse spodumene 
concentrates are favoured as products for export markets, 
the potential revenue from Sn may be lost. 
Pollucite, from previous mining at Sinclair and in samples 
evaluated from Greenbushes, have been and are amenable to concentrating as a product for Cs. The high concentration 
of Rb (0.9 – 3.6 wt%) in feldspar in some of the Pilgangoora 
ores make it a favourable resource for Rb. Feldspars can be floated by reverse flotation method from the spodumene float quartz tails by conditioning the slurry with hydrofluoric 
acid and adjusting the pH to 2–2.5, adding tallow amine 
acetate collector, kerosene and a frother (Heyes et al., 2012). Further upgrade of Rb feldspar from albite is by the addition of NaCl during flotation.Summary and conclusions
Lithium is a key component in the production of rechargeable batteries for use in a wide range of products including portable electronic devices (mobile phones), 
e-bikes/scooters and energy storage systems. However, 
electric and hybrid vehicles exert the strongest demand, accounting for ~70% of Li end-use applications in 2020, which is forecast to increase to ~90% by 2031. In 2020, 
Australia produced nearly 49% of global Li output, largely 
from mines in Western Australia. While WA deposits have been generally classified as LCT pegmatites, there is limited published information on their geology, mineralogy and processing characteristics. The aim of this work was 
to develop a geometallurgical framework for WA lithium 
pegmatite deposits that would potentially lead to improved efficiencies in exploration, mineral beneficiation and processing techniques. The project was divided into three 
integrated modules of geology, mineralogy and metallurgy. 
The project deliverables for each module and the outcomes in each case are summarized below.
The Geology module focused on assessing the geology of 
LCT pegmatites in WA in terms of the formation, texture and 
deposition.GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western Australia159Deliverables Outcomes
1. Field studies t o target the main LCT pegmatites 
and regions in Western AustraliaDrillcore and representative examples of LCT pegmatites were obtained for 10 deposits in the Archean Yilgarn and Pilbara Cratons of Western Australia for detailed petrological, 
mineralogical, geochemical and geochronological analysis. The LCT pegmatites examined in this study were:
Southern Yilgarn: Greenbushes, Mt Cattlin
Eastern Yilgarn: Bald Hill, Mt Marion, Sinclair Caesium Deposit, Dome North, Londonderry, Dalgaranga, Kathleen Valley
Pilbara: Pilgangoora.
The LCT pegmatites examined in the current investigation included most of the significant (e.g. Greenbushes, Kathleen Valley and Pilgangoora) LCT pegmatites in Western Australia.
2. P etrochronological and geochemical synthesis 
of LCT pegmatite mineral systems in Western 
AustraliaGeochronological characterization of the Greenbushes, Pilgangoora, Dalgaranga, Bald Hill and Londonderry LCT pegmatites was undertaken by:
• U–Pb dating of zircon
• 40Ar/39Ar-dating of spodumene
• 40Ar/39Ar-dating of muscovite
Zircon U–Pb ages of 2643–2629 Ma were obtained for project samples, a range consistent with other WA LCT pegmatites and which coincides with a major period of global pegmatite 
emplacement from 2650–2600 Ma. The size (mainly <100 µm) and low U content (mainly <100 ppm) of zircon suggests they are inherited and did not crystallize during pegmatite 
formation. Therefore, measured U–Pb ages provide a maximum constraint to the relative timing of pegmatite crystallization. A revised, older age for the emplacement of the 
Greenbushes pegmatite at 2631 ± 4 Ma is a significant new finding. It remains to be confirmed if the zircon grains examined may be xenocrysts.
40Ar/39Ar dating established a plateau age of ~2605 Ma for muscovite from Bald Hill which compares with a zircon U–Pb age of 2643 ± 10 Ma indicating that cooling took place deep in 
the crust over a period of ≈40 Ma. A similar interpretation was made for the Londonderry LCT pegmatite.
40Ar/39Ar dating of spodumene at Mt Cattlin established a robust plateau age of ≈1100 Ma, interpreted to represent the alteration of spodumene by a hydrothermal resetting event, 
possibly related to fluid flow associated with mafic-dyke emplacement.
Mineral–textural relationships were assessed in relation to the P–T phase relationship of the Li–Al–Si system and allowed crystallization pathways for the Londonderry, Dome North 
and Greenbushes pegmatites to be determined. This informs the resulting style of Li mineralization on a case-by-case basis and enables a prediction of the style of Li mineralization and, 
therefore, the appropriate processing option for other locally associated pegmatite bodies.
Mineral–textural relationships can also inform the inferred emplacement history and genetic association of pegmatites at the deposit scale. For example, the pseudo-morphic alteration 
of spodumene and the occurrence of lepidolite at the Mt Mann pegmatite swarm, coupled with the different structural aspect relative to the Kathleen’s Corner pegmatite at Kathleen Valley, argues against an ultimately larger, merged pegmatite body at depth, as previously interpreted.
3. Geochemistr y signature of minerals to identify 
pegmatite associations, which can assist in 
targeting LCT pegmatitesThe mineral composition of spodumene and associated phases, such as mica and Ta–Nb oxides were evaluated to establish elemental signatures as useful tools for targeting potential 
pegmatite mineralization.
Spodumene typically has Li–Al–Si contents close to the expected contents for stoichiometric LiAlSi2O6. However, alteration of spodumene results in the systematic removal of Li from 
the spodumene structure. For example, altered spodumene from Mt Cattlin contains 5.15 wt% Li2O compared to 8.03% Li2O for pure spodumene. In spodumene:
• Fe and Mn are the main impurities with a combined value of 1.2 wt%.
• Sodium, at 500–1200 ppm, was the only other trace element present at consistently elevated amounts.
• Trace element patterns were highly variable, with overall depletion in REEs.
• No regional differences in the major, trace or REE composition of spodumene, useful as a potential provenance indicator, were identified.
Changes in mica (muscovite/lepidolite) composition followed well-correlated and highly predictable trends in relation to their Li and F contents, Li:Al and Li:Si, and K:Rb ratios:
• The F content is a useful proxy for estimating the Li content of mica.
• Changes in the K and Rb content of mica can be used to determine the relative degree of pegmatite fractional crystallization and are potentially useful in assessing Li prospectively.
• Low K:Rb ratios established all WA LCT pegmatites as being highly fractionated compared to other global pegmatites.
• The Greenbushes Deposit was the most highly fractionated of the WA pegmatites examined and is equivalent to the Tanco and Red Cross Lake LCT pegmatites in Canada
Thus, from the changes in mica composition described, it is recommended that in greenfields/brownfields exploration, assessment of pegmatite mineralization potential be based on 
mica composition as in the field:
• Mica (muscovite/lepidolite) is more easily identified compared to the typically white, Li-bearing and barren (feldspar and quartz) phases that also occur.
• Mica is typically present as coarsely crystalline ‘books’ of well-defined crystals.
• This makes mica highly amenable to compositional analysis using hand-held or field portable instruments (e.g. XRF , LIBS).
The  Cs and Ta content of muscovite can be used as an exploration tool for identifying potential Ta mineralization:
• Pegmatites that host muscovite with a Ta content >65 ppm and a Cs content >500 ppm are likely to host Ta–Nb mineralization.
• The high Cs and Ta contents of muscovite at Greenbushes, Mt Cattlin, Dome North and Londonderry are consistent with the common occurrence of Ta mineralization (Ta>>Nb) at 
these deposits.
• However, the low Cs (<500 ppm) and Ta (<65 ppm) contents for all but one muscovite examined at Dome North does not support the potential of Ta mineralization at this pegmatite.
Changes in the Ta–Nb mineralogy, as reflected in their composition (Ta:Nb and Mn:Fe ratios), provide an additional exploration tool useful for assessing pegmatite fractionation and the potential enrichment style of mineralization (i.e. Ta vs Nb content).
• TIMA-EDS measured Ta:Nb and Mn:Fe ratios showed that the majority of tantalite–columbite analysed was manganiferous (Mn>Fe with Ta≈Nb)
• Columbite–tantalite from Kathleen Valley was the most manganiferous, with an average Mn content of ≈10.2%.
• At Dome North, limited EDS analysis revealed that Ta:Nb and Mn:Fe ratios supported a ferrocolumbite dominated mineralogy, with Nb>>Ta and Fe>Mn.
• This is consistent with the current, relatively low, resource estimate of 33 ppm Ta2O5 for the Cade Deposit.
4. Classification sch eme produced that is 
useful in exploration targeting for economic LCT pegmatites and grade control in mining operationsFrom the main Li-host identified by TIMA mineral mapping, all pegmatites investigated in this study were classed as part of the LCT family following the scheme of Černý et al. (2012).
The majority of pegmatites belong to one of three main complex sub-types:
• Spodumene  — Greenbushes, Kathleen Valley, Dome North, Mt Marion
• Petalite  — Londonderry
• Lepidolite  — Sinclair Caesium Deposit
Exceptions are Mt Cattlin, Bald Hill and Pilgangoora, classed as albite-spodumene  types, and the Dalgaranga pegmatite, which is classed as an albite-type .
Pegmatite classification is important to informing the most appropriate processing route that accommodates differences in the main Li-host and associated mineralogy.For example, the presence of massive petalite, as identified at Londonderry and Dome North, requires a different processing approach due to the lighter density of petalite  
(2.4 gm.cm
 3) compared to spodumene (3.0 gm.cm-3). Hence, as the recovery of petalite cannot be achieved by use of gravity/density separation techniques, alternative recovery (i.e. 
flotation) techniques are required.Mineral–textural characteristics are also a significant factor in the implementation of the most appropriate processing scheme. The development of the characteristic SQI texture that 
results by the alteration of petalite (e.g. Dome North pegmatite) or by the (inferred) alteration of the high-temperature Li-phase vergilite (e.g. Greenbushes) requires the application of alternative processing options, as described in section, Geometallurgical framework, to optimize the recovery of Li.
Similarly, the occurrence of mica (muscovite/lepidolite) as described at the Sinclair and Kathleen Valley LCT pegmatites would require a different processing route (refer to the section 
Geometallurgical framework.Wells et al.160The Mineralogy module focused on understanding the deportment of Li and other elements 
of interest in pegmatite deposits and improving the accuracy and precision of analytical techniques used to measure mineral components in pegmatites. 
Deliverables Outcomes
5. Refine the analyt ical techniques (TIMA, EPMA, 
LA-ICP-MS) to improve precision and accuracy to 
quantify pegmatite samplesDue to the very coarse crystalline nature of LCT pegmatites, large, polished mounts (to 75 x 50 mm) were prepared for TIMA measurement so that a more representative sample could be scanned to better characterize mineral–textural features than otherwise could be achieved with a standard, 25-mm round mount.
Reliable EPMA quantification of mineral composition requires a detailed understanding of sample chemical matrix (e.g. peak interference and overlap) effects that can influence the 
quality of the analysis.
• Initial wavelength scans identified interference of Si on the Rb (L-α) peak. This required substituting the commonly used RbZnSi-glass standard for a CaAlGeRb-glass standard to 
avoid over-estimating Rb abundance. This was particularly important for mica EPMA analysis, where the Rb content is used (along with the K content) as a measure of pegmatite fractionation.
• Similarly, allowance for the interference of Mn on Fe analyses was also required. This too was important for quantifying, for example, the Fe impurity content of spodumene. The Fe 
content is one of the key measures used by the WA Li industry to assess the purity of a spodumene concentrate.
For LA-ICP-MS analysis, the condition of the sample surface as presented to the laser is important in ensuring consistent and reliable analyses. Care was taken not to over-polish the 
sample surface presented for analysis due to problems with efficient coupling of the laser for well-polished, highly transparent samples (e.g. petalite and spodumene). This can result in incomplete ablation and affect the reliability of the analysis, resulting in under-estimating element content.
TIMA characterization identified spodumene from the Greenbushes pegmatite as a candidate for development as Li-isotope standard and isotope analysis protocol.Sample characterization using LA-ICP-MS analysis confirmed the isotopic homogeneity of spodumene with δ
7Li measurements within ≈1 permil. Independent isotopic compositional 
analysis, conducted by the Queen’s Facility for Isotopic Research, Queens University, Ontario, confirmed the suitability of the Greenbushes spodumene as a Li-isotopic standard.
The Greenbushes spodumene is now used as a Li-isotope measurement standard, as part of an FBI-CRC funded project, which aims to develop trace element/Li-isotope signatures as 
provenance indicators of LCT pegmatites.
6. Assessment of th e deportment of Li and other 
elements of interest and associated minerals in pegmatite deposits.
Produce a quantitative understanding of the 
mineralogical deportment of both economically important (Li, Nb, Ta) and environmentally deleterious (F , Mn) elements within mineral associated with pegmatite oresThe mineral composition and element deportment of the principal Li-host (spodumene) and associated gangue phases was quantified by application of combined EPMA, LA-ICP-MS, TIMA mapping/EDS analysis and ToF-SIMS analysis.
Spodumene, as the principal Li-host, was essentially compositionally ‘clean’, with Li–Al–Si contents close to that expected for pure LiAlSi
2O6. The main element impurities hosted by 
spodumene are:
• Fe and Mn to a combined maximum of 1.2 wt%.
• Na (between 500 and 1200 ppm)
A significant outcome was the characterization of two main pegmatite-alteration styles that pr ef erentially impact spodumene defined as:
1. Complete/near-complete, pseudo-morphic replacement of spodumene by a massive, dark-green to black, fine-grained, Li-mica/cookeite assemblage.
• Cookeite is an Fe/Mg-bearing, Li-chlorite, containing up to 2.86 wt% Li2O
• Alteration imparts a dull to waxy-mottled texture
• Only spodumene at Bald Hill and Mt Cattlin affected
• Associated by a thermal overprinting event (dyke intrusion?) as previously described
• Alteration introduces significant K (and other element impurities, such as Fe, Mg, Rb and Mn) and results in near-complete loss of Li.
2. Symplectic (graphic-textured), in-situ alteration where spodumene is in contact with Na/K-feldspar:
• Co-eval to early-post crystallization replacement alteration of spodumene
• Forms a microscopic, graphic-textured, SQI type
• Not associated with petalite alteration
• Results in complete loss of Li
• Leaves residual, low-Al-bearing (1–2 wt%) ‘quartz’
• Affects nearly all examples of LCT pegmatites examined (the Sinclair Caesium Deposit is the exception).
Related to the first alteration style, spodumene almost universally displays some level of secondary, sericitic-like alteration as microscopic veining:
• Developed along internal fractures and cleavage planes
• Alteration is predominantly K-rich but also introduces F , Mn, Fe, Mg and Rb.
Numerous (primary and secondary) mineral inclusions within spodumene crystals were also detected. Primary phases and their associated element impurities include:
• Feldspar (mainly albite; lesser K-feldspar)—Na, K
• Quartz—Si
• Mica (muscovite/lepidolite)—K, Rb, Cs
• Tourmaline—B, Mn, Fe, Na
• Ta–Nb oxides—Fe, Mn, Ta, Nb
• Apatite—F , Mn, Ca
• Cassiterite—Sn, Ta
• Garnet—Fe, Mn, Ca
• Fluorite—Ca, F
• Beryl—Be
• Pollucite (only at Greenbushes)—Cs, Na.
Additional, secondary mineral inclusions and their associated element impurities include:
• Fe-chlorite—Fe, Mn (locally developed at Pilgangoora)
• Calcite—Ca
• ‘Feldspathic’—F , Rb.
Alteration and primary mineral impurities hosted by spodumene are ultimately carried through to the final ore (spodumene) concentrate, especially for coarse (14–18 mm) size fractions 
preferred by some hard-rock, Li producers (deliverable 8). 
7. An independent a ssessment on the practical 
application of LIBS technology in exploration and mining operationsQuantification of pegmatite Li and associated element (Al, Si, Fe, K, Mg) contents was assessed by application of PLS analysis of LIBS analysis of representative powders of known (XRF) composition.
Calibration PLS, cross-validation models were developed from a standard data set of 37 pegmatite samples with 4 samples chosen as unknown, validation samples.
Predicted PLS, cross-validation models of the pegmatite Li, Si and Al content in the validation data set were close to the known Li, Si and Al contents with relative percentage errors of 
mainly <12%.
• However, Li content of the four validation samples could not be consistently predicted.
• Similarly, modelled contents of the Fe, K and Mg content were not reliably predicted.
The LIBS technique is known to suffer from a few inherent, sample-related effects. The robustness and precision of PLS-LIBS quantification would be improved by developing cross-
validation-calibration models from a larger, more extensive sample set and by paying close attention to more consistent sample preparation to minimize sample surface (granularity, 
textural) and chemical matrix effects.
It is recommended that the existing calibration sample set be expanded to include a minimum of 200–250 representative examples from all significant WA LCT pegmatites to ensure the 
range of sample compositional variability is accounted by the prediction models.GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western Australia161In the metallurgy module, the physical liberation characteristics of Li-bearing mineral 
particles and chemical processing behaviour of LCT pegmatites were correlated to the mineralogy data generated in the geology and mineralogy studies. 
Deliverables Outcomes
8. Assess the miner al liberation characteristics of 
mineral components within pegmatite ores Twenty-one samples that represent different deposits and lithologies from Mt Cattlin, Bald Hill, Greenbushes and Pilgangoora regions were examined. The main source of Li is 
spodumene in these deposits, with regions containing Li micas (lepidolite and zinnwaldite), as well as petalite. 
Generally, the coarse nature of spodumene within quartz, feldspar and muscovite mineral matrix allows for >90% recovery of the spodumene, with expected Li grades above 3 wt%. 
Factors that limit recovery and grade are regions with:
• Graphic-textured spodumene-quartz alteration intergrowth between spodumene and K/Na-feldspar, as observed in most samples but extensively in samples from Pilgangoora. 
• Partially altered spodumene containing micas in fine interstitial veins and fractures and as inclusions within spodumene grains. This is prevalent at both Mt Cattlin and Bald Hill where 
high-grade, white spodumene in quartz, feldspar and muscovite zones transitions to low-grade, highly altered green to dark-green spodumene.
• Separation of middlings containing high mica and/or quartz/feldspar contents and finer grinding them would improve the recovery of spodumene in these orebodies.
• In Greenbushes samples, spodumene can be well liberated from the main gangue mineral quartz, with high recovery and Li grades of 3.5 wt%. Fine grinding would be required to liberate spodumene associated with graphitic texture intergrowths with quartz and in some areas with feldspars.
Tantalum minerals in all deposits examined are mainly associated with the gangue minerals or are freely liberated under the particle sizes examined in this study. Hence, Ta minerals can be upgraded and concentrated separately from spodumene, as is practised in industry.
At Greenbushes, antimony and arsenic are present as stibiomicrolite and parabrandtite, respectively, as finely disseminated as grains within spodumene. There are also associations of 
pollucite with spodumene.
A high percentage of cassiterite in most samples are locked and associated with spodumene and therefore will report along with spodumene grains in the concentrate.
Analysis of the liberation characteristics of spodumene concentrates collected fr om the beneficiation cir
 cuits at five mines reveal high contamination content of gangue mineral of up to 
20 wt%. Of this only around 5 wt% is associated and locked with spodumene. Techniques such as ore sorting can be used to reduce mineral impurities to the beneficiation circuit.
9. Diagnostic metho d to allow prediction of the 
metallurgical response of different pegmatite ores 
to existing processes used to extract Li.
Examine the thermal and chemical response and 
link them to the mineralogical propertiesA two-stage calcination–sulphate-roast testing procedure at fixed particle size, temperature, retention time and acid-to-Li content dosage rate was used to simulate and assess the Li-extraction process. 
Temperature conditions that favour α–β conversion of spodumene required to make the Li amendable to extraction are 1050 °C to 1100 °C.
The content of gangue minerals in concentrate needs to be minimized as many of the gangue minerals have melting points or decomposition temperatures below the spodumene 
transformation temperature (e.g. micas, carbonates). Melt products contribute to clinker formation that lines the internal surface of the calcine roaster leading to production delays and 
increased maintenance costs.
The key factors affecting the extraction of Li from spodumene ores include:
• Incomplete conversion of γ-spodumene to β-spodumene during calcination may contribute to poor Li extraction during the acid-baking and water-leaching stage. Some gangue 
minerals (e.g. quartz) may prevent complete heat transfer to spodumene during calcination and act as an insulator that impedes the spodumene α–β transformation process. Hence finer grinding, longer heating periods and more effort at removing gangue will be required.
• The exothermic reaction of the oxidation of Fe and Mn within both mica and spodumene grains can promote the thermal transformation of spodumene.  Some control on the rate of 
heating and oxidation during the calcination process of high-Fe spodumenes may be required to reduce the development of fines. All ferrous iron in concentrate feed to calcination 
stage should be converted to ferric iron to reduce Fe solubility and interference in downstream processing.
• Micaceous minerals (particularly ones high in Fe, Mg, K and Na) form melts that armour coat spodumene grains during the calcination step, which can prevent full conversion of 
spodumene to the β-form, as well as render calcined spodumene refractory to extraction through the sulphate-roasting and water-leaching step. Regions of highly altered spodumene with chlorite-mica content in Mt Cattlin and Bald Hill deposits will have to be treated by alternative processes (e.g. alkaline pressure leaching).
• Feldspars also form partial melting products that coat spodumene grains and increase the refractory nature of spodumene. Maintaining the kiln temperature at ~1100 °C, if possible, 
would reduce the impact of feldspar.
• The slow rate of diffusion of acid into large particles causes slow and incomplete Li extraction. Finer grinding will favour improved Li extractions up to ~95%.
• While Li extraction is considered an ion-exchange process, where H ions replace Li in the residual calcined spodumene structural matrix, this work has shown that Al is also extracted 
during the sulphuric acid-baking and water-leach processing phase, which causes shrinkage and agglomeration of particles that may reduce full Li extraction. Accordingly, an 
optimum grind size must be established prior to acid baking to allow diffusion and leaching of Li from within calcined spodumene particles.
10. Practical geomet allurgical model useful as a 
benchmarking tool to identify factors which 
favour or limit full recoveries in different ore 
deposits and improve the economic returns of 
mining operationsProcess options for treating different orebodies were categorized based on the classification of 10 pegmatite deposits examined in this study.
• LCT albite-spodumene pegmatite, LCT complex spodumene pegmatite  (High quartz and feldspar, with moderate size spodumene) – Staged crushing incorporating HPGR, 
production of coarse concentrate by DMS and a fine concentrate by flotation (Pilgangoora, Mt Marion Greenbushes and Kathleen Valley).
• LCT albite-spodumene pegmatite  (Quartz, feldspar, with high mica content and coarse to very coarse spodumene) – Staged crushing and liberation of spodumene and 
concentration with staged DMS cyclone configuration (Bald Hill, Mt Cattlin)
• LCT albite pegmatite, LCT complex lepidolite pegmatite  (zinnwaldite, Lepidolite, albite, quartz) – Primary crushing, SAG or rod mill followed by magnetic separation to generate 
concentrate for zinnwaldite (Dalgaranga) or flotation for lepidolite (Sinclair, Lepidolite Hill).
• LCT complex petalite pegmatite  (Petalite zoned with feldspar and quartz) – Excavation, crushing and grinding to produce DSO (Londonderry and Pioneer Dome).
The major issues and impediments of treating pegmatite orebodies and solutions were listed, covering the effects of mineralogy and specific details of equipment used to treat ores. Key factors important in selecting a processing option for treating ores include:
• Li mineral host and impurities (Fe, Mn) within the mineral structure.
• Grain size of mineral host
• Mineral assemblage, texture and associations with the Li host mineral.162
Wells et al.Further work
Orebody knowledge
Targeting of LCT pegmatites  — The current study provides 
a comprehensive evaluation of several significant WA 
LCT pegmatites. However, for a more complete overview of the hard-rock, Li resources of WA, it is recommended 
further work be conducted to include other known LCT 
pegmatites including the Wodgina (Albermarle/Mineral Resources), Pilgangoora (Pilbara Minerals) and Mt Holland 
(Wesfarmers/SQM) deposits, and the Mt Deans (Aruma 
Resources Ltd.) and Buldania Lithium Projects (Liontown Resources). Such work would determine, for example, if the 
same mineral fractionation trends identified in the current 
study are inherent across all of Western Australia’s hard-rock Li deposits. Indeed, future work would benefit by including other LCT deposits Australia-wide, such as Core Lithium’s Finnis Lithium project, located approximately 20 km south 
of Darwin.
For the purposes of completeness and to extend and further 
support (or otherwise) the findings of the current study, it is 
recommended that representative examples of the main ore types at these deposits also be characterized following the 
same approach as the M532 study.
This will provide a more comprehensive pegmatite 
classification for Li-ores in Western Australia, and test 
the assertion that each pegmatite type has an optimal 
processing route (e.g. grind-size, dense medium separation [DMS] vs flotation).
Inclusion of additional drillcore  — mineralogical and 
compositional characterization of the Mt Cattlin and Bald Hill 
LCT pegmatites relied on the evaluation of only pit-exposed material. To understand better the mineral, compositional 
and geo-petrological evolution and fractionation of the host 
pegmatite at these deposits, drillcore intersecting the main pegmatite bodies should also be examined using the same protocols as applied in this study.
Geochronology  — 
40Ar/39Ar dating of muscovite from Bald 
Hill established this as a suitable technique for dating 
muscovite, and enabled assessment of the cooling/closure 
period of the Ar-isotope system, when compared to zircon 
U–Pb ages. Follow-up dating of muscovite and lepidolite of other LCT pegmatites (e.g. Kathleen Valley, Sinclair 
Caesium Deposit, Dome North) will be undertaken as part 
of the AuScope National Argon Map initiative. For example, 
at Kathleen Valley, the different pegmatite architecture and differences in mica composition between the Mt Mann and Kathleen Valley pegmatite swarms suggest two separate emplacement events that may also be temporally distinct. 
Ar–Ar dating of mica from both pegmatite swarms will 
help to establish the relative timing of their formation. Future 
40Ar/39Ar-dating of mica from other LCT deposits, 
not included in the forthcoming round (e.g. Wodgina and Pilgangoora), should also be included in a later sample suite that will help in establishing a statewide, temporal 
framework of pegmatite formation. In conjunction with this, 
it is recommended that U–Pb dating of cassiterite also be 
undertaken. While cassiterite ages obtained in the current 
study should be treated with caution, the measured Pb–Pb ages were significantly younger than those obtained for inherited zircon. Future matrix-matched analyses using larger, ablation spots would confirm this, and provide a 
further indication of whether cassiterite yields a pegmatitic 
crystallization age.
Fluid inclusion studies  — Analysis of crystal-fluid inclusions 
within Li-bearing alumino–silicates (e.g. spodumene), as 
applied to the Tanco (e.g. London, 2017) and Greenbushes 
(e.g. Partington et al., 1995; Partington, 2017) LCT 
pegmatites, inform the cooling history and crystallization 
evolution of the pegmatite melt. Hence, it is recommended 
that fluid inclusion studies of other WA LCT pegmatites be undertaken. This will aid in refining the cooling and crystallization evolution of the pegmatite melt to understand better pegmatite genesis and will more precisely establish the 
P–T conditions required as useful indicators in terranes that 
may host other LCT pegmatites.
Mineralogical analysis
LIBS quantification of pegmatite mineral  composition  — Application of the LIBS technique 
showed promise as a means of quantitative  analysis of pegmatite composition. However,   
the LIBS technique is known to suffer from a few inherent, 
sample-related effects, such as the condition of the sample 
surface and chemical matrix effects. The robustness of 
PLS modelling and quantitative prediction of pegmatite 
composition would be improved by inclusion of a much 
larger and more extensive LCT pegmatite sample suite and 
in paying close attention to more consistent matrix matching 
between sample unknowns and those used as calibration 
standards.
Quantitative analysis of Ta–Nb-oxide mineralogy  — Current 
assessment of Ta–Nb mineralogy and inferred fractionation 
(Ta:Nb, Mn:Fe) trends of the host LCT pegmatite was based on (at best) semi-quantitative, TIMA-EDS analysis. Quantitative analysis, by use of EPMA measurement, of 
Ta–Nb oxides and associated heavy mineral phases will 
establish a more reliable assessment of the heavy-mineral 
fraction composition, and of the fractionation trends that may 
be inferred. In addition, such an approach will:
•	Establish if a unique mineralogical or mineral chemistry 
fingerprint can be assigned to distinguish the various LCT pegmatite types.
•	Determine if mineralogy and mineral chemistry of Ta–Nb oxides and associated (resistate) heavy minerals can be applied as a prospect ranking and/or vectoring tool in 
greenfields/brownfields exploration.
Metallurgy considerations
While there are considerable studies on alternative processes 
to extract lithium from spodumene, there have been very few 
attempts to improve the traditional process or to understand 
the causes behind its limitations. The results from the current study will provide a guidance to the factors that influence recovery and allow improvement in efficiencies in mineral 
beneficiation and processing of pegmatite ores. Factors that 
need to be considered are as follows:
Comminution and beneficiation  — Recovery yields of 
Li-bearing minerals from comminution and beneficiation 
circuits often do not meet design specifications. Western 163
GSWA Report 228  The geology , mineralogy and geometallurgy of EV materials deposits in Western AustraliaAustralia spodumene producers sometimes sacrifice 
recovery for grade, achieving Li recoveries of 50–75% to meet Chinese converter specifications, which leads to 
poor resource utilization and loss of valuable spodumene 
to waste. In particular, losses to fines generated during comminution are not recovered (20–40%). Comminution is also power intensive and the highest energy cost of 
the whole comminution and beneficiation plant, which 
contributes the most to carbon emissions. Assessment of different comminution methodologies to reduce energy cost emissions and fines is necessary. The use of HPGR have improved efficiency, but other processes such as 
electrodynamic fragmentation (e.g. SelFrag) could be 
investigated, particularly if industrial fragmentation systems begin production for commercial operation. The work in this study and existing process plants has shown that high 
recoveries at coarse size fraction are possible.
Further work also needs to examine the improvement in 
the efficiency of removing gangue material prior to the beneficiation stage. Several companies are already examining 
ore sorting technologies that can eliminate the processing of 
waste material through the DMS circuits.
Actual reagent mixtures used by several mine sites to float 
fine spodumene are confidential in nature. Flotation of 
silicates such as spodumene is difficult, with the presence 
of clays and slimes affecting recovery. Oleic acid has traditionally been used as the collector but needs to be conditioned with soda ash or sodium hydroxide to form water soluble oleates. In addition, process water chemistry is likely 
to have a significant effect on overall flotation performance 
of spodumene and is an area that warrants further study.
The processing of Ta minerals to make concentrates 
should be considered in all LCT pegmatite processing. 
Tantalum is used in electrolytic capacitors and 
corrosion-resistant chemical equipment. Many of the Ta minerals contain Nb, which is a highly valuable element used for strengthening alloys but can also be 
used to improve the electrochemical behaviour and 
stabilize high-nickel cathodes in the Li-battery industry  
(Xin et al., 2021). Options for improving the processing and extraction of cassiterite should also be considered.
Calcination and acid baking — Existing technology for 
refining lithium is not designed for fit for purpose in treating 
the variability in Li-bearing pegmatite ores. With push for downstream development of lithium refineries, companies will be able to tailor their processing of Li to maximize Li 
recovery from their orebodies. This includes treating both 
high- and low-grade materials through separate process routes.
Further work is required to establish an effective calcination 
procedure for maximizing lithium recovery and reducing 
the impact of mineral impurities. In particular, furnaces which provide a uniform temperature gradient, such as flash calcination furnaces (e.g. Calix), or static block furnaces 
need to be examined to regulate and control the mineral 
conversion process during calcination. Potentially, the use of electric furnaces can promote the use of renewable energy sources rather than conventional furnaces, which use carbon fuels, such as gas heaters. Water balances and production of 
sodium sulphate wastes also must be managed effectively, 
which entails additional liability and risks.
Further studies are required on the full flowsheet to ensure 
Australia remains competitive in the global market. Problems associated with conventional conversion processes can potentially be overcome by replacing the thermal roast/bake step with an alkaline conversion conducted at low 
temperature (~250 °C) and pressure. Such processes have 
been developed by Outotec (Carbonate leach, https://www.mogroup.com/portfolio/lithium-processing/) and Lithium Australia (Liena™ process).
The processing of Li-rich, micaceous deposits has yet to be 
developed on a commercial scale in Australia. These were previously considered as uneconomic. However, process options are available (e.g. halide based SiLeach process, 
L-Max Technology, Sulphate calcination processing) that may 
allow treatment of more complex Li-feedstock.
Several novel alternative processes have been developed 
for the concentration and recovery of lithium from solution that may warrant further investigation. These include an electrodialysis approach, such as the ELi® process co-
developed by Neometals and Minerals Resources, and the 
Nemaska Lithium’s electromembrane process (Nemaska Lithium Inc., 2019; Butcher, 2020). Other processes involving manganese Oxide Ion Sieves (Chitrakar et al., 2001), 
ion-exchange technology (Francis, 2020; Lilac Solutions 
Inc., 2021) and solvent extraction (Tenova Advanced Technologies, 2021) have been developed mainly for chloride or brine solutions. The PosLX process involves the preparation of a Li–phosphate solution. Apart from the 
Nemaska Lithium’s electromembrane process, most of the 
other technologies require the recovery of Li from brine solutions. 
Linkage with other projects
The mineralogical understanding and geochemical nature of many of the pegmatite ores presented in this report forms the basis for at least two follow-on applied research activities:
1 A  geometallurgical research consultancy will be made 
available in the John de Laeter Centre to undertake work with industry linking ore body knowledge to geometallurgical behaviour that will improve the 
beneficiation and chemical processing efficiency of 
lithium minerals
2 A  ‘Trusted Supply Chain’ project underway in the Future 
Battery Industries CRC will test whether geochemical fingerprinting techniques can discriminate batteries produced from Australian ores by:
•
 building a chemical database for  battery minerals and 
processed materials sourced from Australian and 
international producers
• using pr ovenance data to build a digital platform that 
will allow consumers to track ethically sourced battery materials through the EV supply chain.164

MRIWA REPORT M532 –  
THE GEOLOGY, MINERALOGY AND GEOMETALLURGY OF  
EV MATERIALS DEPOSITS IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA
M Wells, M Aylmore and B McInnes 
Western Australia is the world’s largest producer of lithium (Li), mainly 
as spodumene concentrate. However, development of these uniquely complex deposits has only recently become economic due to rising demand for Li in batteries for electric vehicles. This MRIWA 
and industry-supported project has generated new petrology, 
mineralogy, geochemistry and geochronology data from 
some key Li–Cs–Ta (LCT) pegmatite deposits in Western Australia. Characterization and analysis techniques applied include XRD, SEM-EDS, EPMA, LIBS, LA-ICP-MS, SHRIMP U–Pb dating, 
40Ar/39Ar dating, FIB-SEM and 
ToF-SIMS. The mineralogy results are used to produce a comparative geometallurgical classification framework for Western Australian LCT pegmatites. Project samples were assessed using physical liberation, calcination and thermogravimetric methods. The project has built new capability and capacity in the area of LCT pegmatite characterization. It also demonstrates that ore body knowledge and geometallurgical data are critical factors in the production of quality feedstock, and optimizing the economics of lithium mining operations in Western Australia.REPORT
