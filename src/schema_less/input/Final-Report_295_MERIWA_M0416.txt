ivEXECUTIVE SUMMARY
PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS
 Salinity and pH adjustments do not greatly increase fines agglomeration in a pumped system.
 Froth flotation grades generally increase at low salinities.
 Slime coatings on sulfides are less likely at low salinities.
 An unoxidised sulfide surface is less sensitive to changes in salinity than a gangue surface.
The  aim  of  this  project  was  to  modify  the  surface  charge  (zeta  potential)  of  fine  pyrite,  
chalcopyrite and pentlandite particles in an attempt to selectively agglomerate them. The primary  
conditions that were adjusted were the salinity and pH. As part of this work an extensive review  
of the flotation of fine sulfide particles (less than 20 μm) was conducted. Several  potential fines 
flotation methods were identified, including selective flocculation/aggregation, carrier flotation,  
use of smaller bubbles, high intensity conditioning (HIC)/shear aggregation, the use of inert  
grinding media, and separate flotation circuits for fines. 
The splitting of fine material into a separate circuit and optimising the conditions for the flotation  
of valuable fines is currently the only proven method in practice. The grades and recoveries of  
this fine material can be high when conditions are optimised and inert grinding media are used.  
There is also some evidence suggesting HIC and some magnetic methods  may aid in the 
recovery of valuable fine material. Fine gangue entrainment can be a problem with any fines  
flotation, so an efficient method of removal of fine gangue is required to prevent poor grades. 
The other methods such as flocculation/aggregation, carrier flotation and the use of smaller  
bubbles have yet to be successfully implemented for the specific purpose of increasing fines  
recovery.
The froth flotation results indicate that a positive zeta potential is typically associated with lower  
grades and potentially lower recoveries. The two factors which had the largest influence on the  
zeta potential were the sulfur content of the ore and the salinity of the process water. Ores with a  
high sulfur content had negatively charged particles that remained relatively unchanged with  
salinity. Ores with a low sulfur content tended to have particles that were less negatively charged  
at low salinity and positively charged at high salinity. A positive zeta potential for an ore is an  
indicator of a high amount of gangue material. The positively charged gangue material could  
form  a  slime  coating  on  the  negatively  charged  sulfide  particles  and  reduce  grades  and  
recoveries. 
1Oxidation of sulfide minerals usually creates a superficial layer of metal hydroxides on particles  
due to hydrolysis of the cations. Metal oxide/hydroxides on the sulfide minerals result in the  
surfaces behaving more like metal oxide/hydroxide surfaces and this can lower the recovery by  
flotation. The zeta potentials shift from the unoxidised sulfide values towards those of the metal  
oxide/hydroxide  products.  These  differences,  between  oxidised  and  unoxidised  sulfide  zeta  
potentials, increased with salinity. The zeta potential was affected to a much greater degree by  
oxidation of the sulfide than by precipitation of metal hydroxide species.
Regardless of the specific sulfide ore, salinity or pH, the zeta potentials were all less than 20 mV  
in magnitude. Particles with zeta potentials in this range tend to agglomerate but our particle  
sizing measurements did not show agglomeration. This may have been due to the break up of  
agglomerates during pumping in the sizing instrument, which would suggest that agglomerates  
formed by reducing the surface charge were weakly bound and easily broken up.
In general the viscosities, elasticities and yield stress values for the sulfide slurries did not  
change significantly between different ore samples, with pH or with changes in salinity. In some  
cases where the zeta potential magnitude was minimised these rheological values did increase.  
These values also increased at points where precipitation of a metal hydroxide was suspected.  
The small but significant changes in rheology which occurred when a metal hydroxide was  
forming were useful as a sensitive indicator of changes occurring within the slurry. 
Multivalent ions, humate, sodium ethyl xanthate and potassium amyl xanthate did not significantly 
affect the zeta potential of the unoxidised sulfides.  For the multivalent cations any effect was  
small and restricted to high pH where metal hydroxide species were likely to form. The only  
added species that had a large effect on the pure sulfide zeta potential was the quaternary  
ammonium compound cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The addition of CTAB had a  
significant effect on the zeta potentials of the sulfides shifting them to more positive values. The 
viscosity, elasticity and yield all increased as the zeta potential approached a value of zero.  
Although the zeta potential of the sulfides was minimised there was no evidence of any increase  
in agglomeration for the fine sulfides.
21. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Project Background and Objectives
Fine material (with a size less than 20 μm) in mineral processing circuits can cause numerous  
problems. These include low froth flotation recoveries, slower solid-liquid separation and slime  
coatings. The agglomeration of this fine material could lead to better thickening and filtration,  
lower slurry viscosity and potentially better froth flotation recoveries. 
The surface charge or zeta potential of this fine material can determine whether it agglomerates  
or remains dispersed. A knowledge of the zeta potential and how it changes can give an insight  
into the separation of solids by flotation, thickening and filtration. It can also provide information  
on the effect of reagents and slime coatings.
The zeta potential has been extensively studied at low pulp densities under dilute ideal conditions  
over the last few decades for flotation and other applications. Very few studies have involved zeta  
potential measurements at high sulfide pulp densities and none have studied sulfides at the high  
ionic strengths found in some mineral processes.
This project investigated the fine particle agglomeration of solids including pyrite, chalcopyrite,  
and pentlandite. The conditions such as solution salinity, pH, presence of certain cations and  
collectors that act to increase the agglomeration and decrease the viscosity of the slurries were  
identified.  The  surface  charge  was  used  to  identify  conditions  which  could  increase  
agglomeration.  The  degree  of  agglomeration  was  assessed  through  rheology  and  sizing  
measurements.  Flotation tests  were  also  conducted to  determine any improvements  in the  
recoveries and grades of the sulfides.
The project objectives are summarised below:
 Review the area of fine particle flotation.
 Use  the  zeta  potential to  identify conditions  which  promote  the  agglomeration,  and  may  
increase the flotation recovery and grade, of fine pyrite, chalcopyrite and pentlandite.
 Determine the zeta potentials for pyrite, chalcopyrite and pentlandite at the high pulp densities  
and salinities generally experienced in mineral processing.
 Determine the zeta potentials and agglomeration for process ores in process water.
 Assess the effect of salinity, pH, mulitvalent ions and collectors on fines agglomeration.
 Correlate zeta potential changes with any changes in rheology.
31.2 Froth Flotation
Froth flotation is a critical step in the recovery of sulfide minerals from gangue as well as the  
selective  separation of  different sulfides.  Froth flotation relies  on the differences  in surface  
hydrophobicity  between  the  valuable  material  and  the  gangue.  These  differences  in  
hydrophobicity are increased through the use of specific surface active reagents added to the  
flotation pulp. The surface of the valuable material is rendered hydrophobic by using surfactants  
commonly known as collectors. The gangue mineral surface can be made hydrophilic by the  
addition of surfactants known as depressants. On passing a stream of air bubbles through the  
pulp the minerals with a hydrophobic surface are able to attach to the bubbles and float to the  
surface while the hydrophilic material sinks. The air bubbles can only continue to support the  
particles once they reach the surface if they are able to form a stable froth. Reagents known as  
frothers are often used to maintain this stable froth. The froth is removed from the flotation cell  
and the concentrated mineral can be refined further. A simplified froth flotation cell is shown in  
Figure 1.
4Figure 1: Froth flotation cell
Most plants have multiple banks of flotation cells that often involve three flotation stages. The  
flotation cells themselves typically contain an impeller that mixes the pulp as well as injecting air  
bubbles. The flotation pulps have a typical solid content between 25 to 45 percent by mass and  
an upper and lower particle size limit for flotation of about 300 μm and 5 μm, respectively [1]. 
Most of the mineral to be recovered is floated in the first group of cells or rougher circuit. This  
concentrate is then sent to the cleaner circuit which consists of a set of cells used to re-float the  
material producing a higher grade. The non-floating material or sink fraction from the rougher  
circuit is normally sent to a set of flotation cells in a scavenger circuit. To avoid any loss of  
valuable material the floated concentrate from the scavenger circuit, and the sink fraction from  
the cleaner circuit, are typically returned to the rougher circuit.  
There are many factors which can play a role in improving the flotation efficiency. These factors  
include  pre-conditioning  of  the  pulp,  the  type  of  grinding  media,  pre-aeration,  reagent  
concentration, sequence of addition, oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur dioxide conditioning, acid leaching  
and conditioning time [ 2].
1.2.1 Contact Angle
The contact angle between the liquid-bubble interface and particle surface (shown in Figure 2) is 
often used to assess the hydrophobicity of a mineral surface. The larger the contact angle the  
greater  the  bubble-particle  adhesion  and  floatability  of  the  mineral.  Naturally  hydrophobic  
surfaces like graphite, sulfur and  bituminous coal have high floatabilities with contact angles  
between  60° to  90°.  The  activity  of  a  particular  collector  can  be  assessed  through  the  
measurement of the contact angle.
5Figure 2: Contact angle between the liquid-bubble interface and the solid surface.
1.2.2 Collectors
Collectors increase the hydrophobicity of sulfide mineral surfaces which in turn increases the  
mineral flotation rate. Some of the more commonly used collectors for sulfide mineral flotation  
are shown in Table 1. The most widely used of these are the xanthates and dithiophosphates  
with the addition rates of xanthates in Australian plants typically ranging from 10 to 300 g/t [ 3]. An 
example of the typical xanthate structure is sodium ethyl xanthate, as shown below.

Hydrophobicity has to be imparted to most minerals in order to efficiently float them. The addition  
of  the  collector  normally  occurs  with  agitation  during  a  conditioning  period.  The  collector  
molecules contain both polar and non-polar groups. The polar group, through chemical, electrical  
or physical attraction, attaches itself to surface sites on the mineral orientating the non-polar end  
into the bulk solution which imparts hydrophobicity to the particle. In general the longer the  
hydrocarbon chain length the more hydrophobic the surface will be . For the solubility required for  
a collector in an aqueous system the chain length is typically limited to two (ethyl) to five (amyl)  
carbon atoms. The chain structure also affects the collector solubility with branched chains  
having a higher solubility  in water than straight chain analogues.
Xanthates adsorb through the formation of insoluble metal xanthates and/or breakdown products  
such as dixanthogen on the sulfide mineral surface [ 4, 5, references in 6, 7, 8]. Some of these 
species are strongly hydrophobic. It has also been established that the sulfide is not joined to the  
collector anions without the action of oxygen [ 1]. Some oxygen is essential for flotation of sulfide  
minerals with thiol collectors.
Dixanthogen is less stable under alkaline conditions whereas xanthates are more stable under  
alkaline  conditions.  Dixanthogen  will  decompose  in  flotation  pulps  and  decomposes  in  the  
presence of nucleophiles, such as hydroxide, cyanide and sulfite ions [ 3]. The structure of 
dixanthogen is shown below.
6
The presence of  elemental sulfur on the surface  of  the sulfide mineral leads to increased  
hydrophobicity and may even allow froth flotation of the mineral in the absence of collector. Sulfur  
can be obtained by partial oxidation of metal sulfides, although sufficient control of the redox  
conditions in these systems can be difficult. Further oxidation of the sulfide mineral past sulfur to  
oxy-sulfur species can occur in the presence of excess oxygen. The fully oxidised oxy-sulfur  
species are not hydrophobic, so additional collectors are usually required to promote flotation.
At pH values around pH 4 all thiols act as effective collectors but xanthates are not stable . The 
xanthates are therefore most widely used at mild alkaline pH. Such alkaline conditions not only 
have the advantage of inhibiting xanthate breakdown , but also precipitate  out unwanted metal  
ions  that  could  react with  the  xanthate.  Cationic  collectors,  like  quaternary  ammonium  
compounds, are relatively weak collectors  because the collector-surface attraction is through  
weaker electrostatic interactions rather than stronger chemical complexation [1]. However, amine 
based collectors have been reported to be capable of floating cyanided pyrite without the use of  
acid preconditioning [ 2].
Mercaptobenzothiazole and dithiophosphates are often preferred to xanthates at lower pH as  
they are more stable. Dithiophosphates are usually regarded as weaker collectors than xanthates  
and do not float pyrite in alkaline solution.  However, dithiophosphonates  can be used as a 
secondary collector [ 3]. Mercaptobenzothiazole is a specialised collector used in the flotation of  
oxidised copper and lead ores and is also sometimes used for the flotation of copper sulfides  
from copper-lead-zinc ores. Thionocarbamate is another specialised collector that is used for  
sulfide copper minerals and copper activated sphalerite.
1.2.3 Frothers
The efficient recovery of valuable sulfide minerals requires a suitably stable froth to be formed.  
The frothers used to help create and stabilise the foam layer are heteropolar surface active  
organic reagents. Frothers  typically contain either hydroxyl, carboxyl, carbonyl, amino, or sulfo  
functional groups in their structure. The frothing action is due to the abil ity of the frother to adsorb  
at the air-water interface and reduce the surface tension which stabilises the bubbles. A good  
frother has negligible collecting power and produces a  froth that is stable but not so stable that it  
causes process transport problems [ 1]. 
Common frothers include reagents such as pine oil, alcohols like methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC),  
7
polyglycols, polyoxyparaffins and cresylic acid.  The concentration of frothers in solution  can 
typically vary between  10 to 50 mg/L [3]. 
1.2.4 Depressants
Depressants render certain minerals hydrophilic and prevent their flotation. Almost all of the  
currently used depressants in sulfide flotation are inorganic with two of the most commonly used  
being cyanide and zinc sulfate. Organic depressants are often not as selective and will depress  
almost all the minerals present. Organic depressants include  guar gums, starch, dextrin, carboxy  
methyl cellulose (CMC), tannic acid, lignin sulfonate and humic acid [ 1,  9]. Many dispersants,  
such as silicates and phosphates, can be used as depressants because they increase the  
hydrophilic nature of most surfaces. Slime coatings can also act as depressants by covering the  
mineral surface and reducing collector adsorption. If the slime particles are hydrophilic they will  
also make the surface they have attached to more hydrophilic further reducing the floatability.
Cyanide is a common depressant for pyrite, sphalerite and certain copper sulfides. The cyanide  
can  complex  with  metal  ions  in  solution  and  react  with  metal  xanthates  to  form  soluble  
complexes [1]. As mentioned earlier the presence of metal xanthates on a surface are thought to  
be partially responsible for the increased hydrophobicity of a surface. Cyanide can be quite  
selective in its depressant effect because of the variation in the solubility of the metal xanthate  
species. Cyanide will act as a depressant in systems once it reaches a critical concentration and  
has complexed the metal ions in solution and solubilised the metal xanthates present.  When 
using cyanides the pH is commonly controlled between pH 7.5 to 9.5 although the optimum value  
may be higher depending on the ore.
Zinc sulfate is another inorganic depressant most often used in the selective separation of galena  
from sphalerite. It is capable of depressing the flotation of sphalerite in the presence of galena  
and is most effective at high pH where zinc hydroxide precipitates. Any zinc hydroxide on the  
mineral surface will render the surface more hydrophilic and depress its flotation. The zinc ions  
will also prevent copper ions from depositing as a hydrophobic copper sulfide on the mineral  
surface. The formation of insoluble hydrophilic zinc cyanide on a surface such as sphalerite will  
also depress the mineral flotation.
Aqueous ferrous and ferric hydroxide ions are associated with  significantly depressed flotation of  
pyrite. There are several mechanisms by which this could occur . When the pH is greater than 6,  
depressed flotation of pyrite by iron species has been previously attributed to the formation of  
ferric hydroxyl xanthate compounds [ 6]. These species are not as hydrophobic in nature as the  
metal xanthate and dixanthogen species believed to be responsible for the hydrophobic surface.  
A second and more probable mechanism is that soluble ferrous or ferric hydroxide ions can react  
with and precipitate out the soluble xanthate collector before the xanthate can adsorb at the  
8pyrite surface.
Non-complexed aqueous ferric ions are only stable under acidic oxidising conditions with Eh  
above +700 mV, as shown in Figure 3. Since practical pyrite flotation occurs at an Eh between  
+200 mV and +300 mV, non-complexed ferric ions will not be present. However, aqueous ferric  
hydroxide ions can exist under these conditions at very small concentrations, such as 10-7 molar.
Wood extracts can also have a depressant effect on the flotation of  sulfide minerals. The  
detrimental effect of  humus organics  on the flotation of  molybdenite has  been investigated  
[reference in  3]. Sodium  humate has  also been shown to selectively depress  pyrite in the  
presence of chalcopyrite at high pH [ 10].
1.2.5 Activators
Activators are soluble metal salts used to modify the surface chemical properties of the mineral  
surface. They are normally used in conjunction with collectors. They can extend the pH range of  
flotation, increase the rate of flotation and improve selectivity. Copper sulfate is one of the most  
9Figure 3: Eh/pH diagram for iron species
widely used activators and can be used to activate and improve the flotation of gold bearing  
pyrite [2, 11], sphalerite [1] and pentlandite [12]. Copper sulfides are less susceptible to oxidation  
than iron sulfides, and so t he formation of copper sulfide or copper xanthate at the mineral  
surface can stabilise the surface and improve flotation [ 1, 11].
Sodium sulfide or sodium hydrosulfide can be used as an activator for oxidised minerals of lead,  
zinc and copper [1]. Over a pH of 8 to 11 almost all the sulfide is present as the hydrosulfide ion.  
These reagents produce a pseudo sulfide surface coating which can then be floated using thiol  
collectors.
1.2.6 Dispersants
Better flotation separations occur if the  particles are fully separated. To achieve this, dispersants  
can be added. As previously noted dispersants often also act as depressants. Many reagents  
have  dispersing  ability  and  include  sodium  hexametaphosphate  (Calgon),  calcium  
ligninsulfonate, sodium silicate and both organic and inorganic polymers. These species can  
disperse a pulp in two ways. They can adsorb onto the particle surface and either increase the  
surface charge (zeta potential) magnitude or create a steric barrier. The result is an increased  
particle-particle repulsion in both cases. An alternative to the addition of a dispersant to the pulp  
is the use of ultrasound to disperse the particles, although an improper ultrasonic treatment can  
induce particle aggregation rather than dispersion [ 13].
1.2.7 pH Control
Where  possible,  flotation  is  carried  out  under  alkaline  conditions  because  most  collectors,  
including xanthates, are stable under these conditions. The alkaline conditions also minimise  
corrosion to cells and pipework  and precipitate out any heavy metal ions, prior to flotation,  
preventing them from activating certain sulfides. The pH is normally controlled by the addition of  
lime, sodium carbonate and to a lesser extent sodium hydroxide and ammonia. Sulfuric acid is  
often used where a decrease in pH is required.
Adding sufficient alkali will depress almost any sulfide mineral and there is a critical pH below  
which the mineral will float for a given collector type, collector concentration and temperature.  
These critical pH values are different for different sulfide minerals and this can be used to  
selectively separate sulfide mixtures. For examp le, lime can act as an effective pyrite depressant,  
by increasing the pH . At high pH levels, most surfaces including the metal oxides and metal  
hydroxides carry a strong negative charge, which  makes  the minerals  hydro philic  and less 
floatable. The formation of a mixed iron hydroxide/oxide, calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate  
film on the pyrite reduces the adsorption of xanthate and makes the surface more hydrophilic . 
Another example is p entlandite which can be floated selectively from pyrrhotite by controlling the  
10pH of flotation to about pH 9. All nickel flotation plants that reject pyrrhotite use pH control [ 14].
Enhanced flotation rates for both pentlandite and chalcopyrite occur when sodium carbonate is  
used [15]. The use of sodium carbonate instead of lime for pH control increases the rate of  
flotation of pentlandite relative to that of pyrrhotite. Sodium carbonate can also increase nickel  
flotation selectivity against magnesium oxide minerals when compared with hydrated lime [ 16]. It 
has been suggested that the carbonate may act as a dispersant in these systems [references in  
16].
1.2.8 Pulp Eh
The reduction or pulp potential, E h, can affect the properties and floatability of sulfide minerals  
and it can be a valuable parameter for monitoring and controlling the flotation process. The E h is 
traditionally measured using a noble metal electrode, usually platinum or gold, with reference to  
either a calomel or silver/silver chloride electrode. The results are then normally reported on a  
hydrogen scale (Standard Hydrogen Electrode, SHE) by adding the appropriate values to the  
reference  electrodes.  This  potential  will  normally  represent  a  mixed  potential  arising  from  
concurrent redox reactions in the pulp. The different types of electrodes that can be used for E h 
measurements and the practical considerations about their use have been reviewed  in detail 
elsewhere [17].
The majority of sulfide flotation plants operate at the “air set” E h potential, generally between  
+200 to +300 mV relative to the SHE [ 7]. The normal operation of a plant within this range with no  
special consideration of E h can give a satisfactory flotation [ 3]. For most sulfides the flotation  
recovery is a function of E h,  and flotation recoveries are normally at their highest in the +200 to  
+300 mV Eh range which is in the mildly to moderately oxidising region . Flotation is slight or  
absent under strongly reducing conditions. The independent control of E h is not simple since any  
reagent added to modify the E h can also have an effect on the mineral surface and other  
parameters.
Changes in Eh are the result of various changes in the concentrations of the species in solution.  
One of  the most  important species  is oxygen. The oxygen concentration decreases during  
grinding and conditioning before rapidly rising to the solubility limit of oxygen in the liquor [ 3]. This 
results in the Eh values becoming more positive as the pulp proceeds through the plant and the  
pulp oxidation becomes more complete. Changes in E h can also be brought about by altering the  
pH, adding redox reagents, altering the flotation gas and controlling the type of grinding media  
and mill. In tests using a mild steel mill, the slurry E h was between -400 to -100 mV [ 18, 19] and 
increased to between +100 to +300 mV on aeration [ 7, 20]. Slurry pH is normally alkaline and  
remains similar throughout flotation.
The pulp potential in a steel mill is frequently in the reducing region and must be raised to a  
11satisfactory level by aeration  otherwise  flotation  recoveries  may be low.  When  the pulp is  
exposed to air the Eh will increase and promote the uptake of collector. The control of pH is about  
the only method by which the E h can be permanently altered in air [ 19]. For conventional flotation  
practice, with the large volumes of oxygen present, the E h is only amenable to control in regions  
that are more oxidising than the natural E h of the pulp. The amount of reducing agents required  
to maintain a reducing environment  would be unrealistically large and therefore not economical.  
The only way Eh control by reagent addition can realistically be achieved is if an inert gas is used  
for flotation [19].
An example of the possible variation in E h is given here for chalcopyrite. When chalcopyrite is  
ground in an inert mill the E h value is about +300 mV and must be lowered to the desired flotation  
value by adding a reducing agent. Grinding in a steel mill gives a much lower potential for the  
chalcopyrite between -300 to -400 mV and an oxidising agent must be added to raise the E h to 
the desired value. Sulfide minerals in a reducing environment are relatively more hydrophilic and  
so it is only when the environment becomes slightly oxidising that flotation occurs [ 19]. 
Self induced flotation is displayed by many sulfides in moderately oxidising solutions but not in  
reducing solutions. Typical conditions required for collectorless flotation are a low pH and a slight  
oxidising potential [1]. In general flotation is observed near potentials at which sulfur would be  
expected to form and the minerals which produce sulfur appear to float most strongly. The  
mineral-collector interaction  may also be potential dependent and so flotation normally only  
occurs over a limited E h range.
The collector induced flotation of sulfide particles with xanthate is a function of E h. The process 
leading to hydrophobicity with thiol collectors  is reported to involve the anodic oxidation of the  
collector at the mineral surface which is driven by the cathodic reduction of oxygen [ 8]. The 
xanthate oxidation process involves the anodic charge transfer chemisorption of xanthate and/or  
the oxidation of xanthate to dixanthogen and/or formation of a metal xanthate [ 7]. The formation 
of the hydrophobic dixanthogen and metal xanthates requires a specific E h value. For example  
the maximum recovery of chalcopyrite occurs at an E h of +200 mV with a butyl xanthate collector.  
The increased flotation recovery at this potential has been attributed to dixanthogen formation.
1.3. Flotation of Fine Particles
The typical change in flotation rate constant as a function of particle size is shown in Figure 4  [1, 
21]. This generalised curve shows that fine and coarse particles are either not recovered at all or  
are recovered poorly during flotation. The grade for recovered fine particles is also lower due to  
the entrainment of gangue fines.  The maximum grade will not necessarily coincide with the  
maximum in the flotation rate constant shown in Figure 4. For example the maximum grade was  
found to occur at a larger particle size than the maximum recovery [ 22].  
12Fine particles are generally considered to be less than 20 μm [22, 23] and intermediate particles  
which float well range from approximately 20 μm up to 150 μm [24]. The slower fines recovery is  
thought to be primarily due to fewer bubble-particle collisions and their low particle momentum  
which reduces the chance of adhesion [ 25]. The proposed mechanism is that fine particles have  
a low inertia and tend to follow liquid streamlines around the bubble rather than continue on in a  
direct path and collide with it, as shown in Figure 5. Intermediately sized particles are more likely  
to continue on in a direct path resulting in more bubble-particle collisions. The decrease in  
recovery for the coarser particles is due to the larger particles being more easily dislodged from  
the bubbles.
The  low  recovery  of  fines  can  also  be  affected  by  electrostatic  forces.  For  fine  particles  
electrostatic forces can be large compared with the inertial and hydrodynamic forces. This means  
that particles which are normally strongly hydrophobic may still not float if their zeta potentials are  
large, particularly if they have the same charge as the bubbles. As the particle size is reduced,  
the influence of these surface forces increases, while the energy transferred to the particle by the  
fluid decreases. For 10 μm particles the kinetic energy transferred to the particle by the fluid can  
still be substantial and in cases of sufficient shear will dominate over the electrostatic forces [ 22]. 
However,  the  electrostatic  forces  may still have  a role  to  play in  fine  particle  interactions,  
especially where the particles are less than 10 μm or under quiescent conditions.

TailingsRougher Concentrate
ScavengersThe improved flotation of t he fines fraction will ideally require both an increasing rate of flotation  
of the valuable mineral and a decrease in the rate of entrainment of fine gangue. Entrainment  
can be the principal recovery method for fine gangue and  accounts for much of the observed  
behaviour of fine material.  The fines occupy the space between the bubbles and enter the  
concentrate via the water in the top most layers of froth. It is usually considered that t he low 
grade of the fine fractions is not due to the non-selective adsorption of the collector but instead is  
caused by the entrainment of fine gangue material [ 21]. This gangue entrainment can limit the  
success of recovering valuable fines at high grades by flotation. All particles finer than 30 μm are 
affected  by  entrainment  [ 22].  Unless  this  gangue  entrainment  is  reduced  techniques  for  
increasing the rate of true flotation could still result in relatively low concentration grades in the  
fine fraction. Some methods for decreasing the effect of g angue entrainment include increasing  
the flotation rate of the valuable mineral, diluting the pulp which flows to the concentrate or  
washing the concentrate to remove the entrained gangue but not the valuable mineral. Unless 
entrainment  can  be  reduced,  conventional  flotation  is  unlikely  to  succeed  as  the  sole  
concentrating method for systems where fine particles dominate [ 21].
Most proposed modifications to conventional flotation have focused on increasing the rate of  
fines flotation. There are several potential methods that may increase the flotation rate of the fine  
material and these are outlined in the following sections. Th e flotation recovery of 2 μm particles 
is approximately 10 times slower than that of 20  μm particles [22]. Any method for improving  
fines recovery would therefore need to improve the recovery approximately 10 fold to get it to that  
of the intermediate particle sizes.
14Figure 5: Fine particle path along streamlines around an air bubble.
1.3.1 Selective Flocculation/Aggregation Technique s
Increasing the overall particle size of the fines will increase their flotation rate and recovery [ 26]. 
The techniques developed to try and increase particle size are all similar in that the fine particles  
are induced to form flocs or aggregates. The flocculation or aggregation of the fine particles  
increases their effective size which increases the probability of particle-bubble collisions. For  
hydrophobic surfaces any increase in particle-bubble collisions will lead to an increased flotation  
rate. These techniques can be divided into three groups: selectiv e flocculation, hydrophobic  
aggregation and electrolyte induced aggregation.
Selective flocculation involves flocculating the valuable fine material while leaving the gangue  
dispersed. The fine material flocs can then be separated from the gangue by flotation at a higher  
rate than would be possible using  non-flocculated fines. If the fine mineral particles in the system  
are not dispersed prior to flocculation and flotation , then the flocculation may not be selective. 
Therefore, it is essential that the system is first fully dispersed prior to selective flocculation. 
Selective flocculation often uses long chain polymer molecules or ions to bridge between the  
particles and form the flocs. Synthetic anionic, non-ionic and cationic polymers can be chosen to  
suit the specific surface charge and groups on the minerals to be aggregated. Multivalent metal  
ions as activators or dispersants can also be used to improve the selectivity of the flocculation.  
The  selectivity of  the flocculants  can  also  be increased  by using modified polymers  which  
incorporate functional groups on the polymers which are known to selectively adsorb to certain  
minerals. 
At one point selective flocculation was a favoured method for fines recovery, but the progress  
was not impressive, especially for low grade feeds [ 21]. Selective flocculation is yet to find  
general application as entrapment of gangue is a major issue. Selectively flocculating the gangue  
first could potentially offer some improvement. In general, a lack of selectivity has restricted the  
applicability of selective flocculation [ 26]. Recently flocculation using a temperature responsive  
flocculant has shown an improved flotation recovery of fine mineral particles compared with  
conventional flotation. The disadvantages of this method are the potentially high energy costs  
associated with raising the pulp temperature as well as the likely entrapment of gangue material  
[27]. 
Another  potential  method  to  increase  the  flotation  of  fines  is  hydrophobic  aggregation.  In  
hydrophobic aggregation the particles are selectively made hydrophobic then intense agitation is  
applied to bring them into very close proximity. The surfaces can be made hydrophobic using a 
hydrophobic polymer like polyethylene oxide (PEO), or a collector. The hydrophobic surfaces  
flocculate through their mutual attraction [ 22] and the more hydrophobic a particle surface is  
made the greater the degree of hydrophobic flocculation. The strength of these aggregates can  
be increased by the addition of a non-polar oil. 
15Hydrophobic aggregation of fine particles can occur in the presence of a xanthate collector. For  
example the hydrophobic flocculation of fine galena particles (less than 30  μm) in aqueous 
suspensions could be induced by adding potassium amyl xanthate and using sufficient kinetic  
energy input [28]. A constant degree of aggregation was obtained after a critical stirring duration  
with the maximum floc size occurring at stirrer speeds between 500 to 700 rpm. The  hydrophobic 
flocculation and the flotation of these galena flocs were substantially enhanced by the addition of  
kerosene. Using a non-polar substance like kerosene (200 mg/L) resulted in a 20-fold reduction  
in the amount of collector required for complete flotation of galena fines. It was suggested that  
the use of kerosene to enhance the floc flotation could give large savings in operating costs since  
kerosene is much cheaper than potassium amyl xanthate. It was also found that the finer the  
galena the more powerful the hydrophobic flocculation.
Finally the aggregation of fine particles can be achieved through the addition of electrolyte which  
decreases  the electrostatic  repulsion  between the  particles.  The  problem  with  this  form  of  
aggregation is that it often causes hetero-agglomeration with no selectivity. Selectivity is essential  
for minerals processing and it is difficult to obtain selective aggregation by electrolyte addition  
alone. This method is rarely used in the mineral processing industry for particle enlargement.
1.3.2 Carrier Flotation
Carrier flotation uses the more easily floated coarse or intermediate sized particles as carriers for  
the fines. The fine particles attach to these coarser particles and are carried into the froth layer.  
This method can be used in situations where it is easier to attach the fines to carrier particles and  
recover them than to selectively aggregate the fines and float them. The weight of the carrier  
particle can be as high as 20 to 40 times the weight of the fines to be removed [ 22]. In some 
cases the carrier may not be a particle but an oil droplet. This variation on carrier flotation is  
sometimes referred to as e mulsion flotation.
The  mechanisms  of  carrier  flotation  are  governed  by  physical,  chemical  and  geometrical  
variables [29]. When the repulsive force due to like charges (zeta potential) is greater than the  
attractive van der Waals force fine particle, or slime, coatings are unlikely to form. The degree of  
fines on the surface a nd the proportion of fines removed from the pulp tend to increase with  
increasing carrier particle size. It could be thought that this would result in the larger particles  
continuing to grow at the expense of smaller particles. In reality the situation deviates from this  
and the aggregation is opposed by a process of re-dispersion due to attrition.
An advantage of carrier flotation over selective aggregation of fines is that the rate of aggregation  
is much faster and the rate of shear required to cause aggregation is less. An oil (e.g. kerosene)  
is normally also added along with a surfactant (e.g. oleate) in carrier flotation to help strengthen  
the aggregates. Oil (kerosene) and oleate were used to aid in the removal of haematite slimes by  
16coarser haematite [30]. It is often simpler if the carrier species is the same mineral as the  
adsorbed fines since this will prevent the difficulties associated with having to separ ate the fine 
material from the carrier. 
1.3.3 High Intensity Conditioning (HIC)  / Shear Aggregation / Shear Flocculation
On intense agitation the fine particles in a pulp or sample can aggregate in a process termed  
shear aggregation or shear flocculation. The agitation speeds required are generally between  
800 to 3000 rpm but are known to vary from system to system [ 29]. The hydrophobicity and  
charge of the particles can influence this aggregation. Particles that carry an opposite charge and  
those with a low or almost zero charge would be expected to aggregate more easily on agitation.  
Surfaces with a high degree of hydrophobicity can also aggregate more easily on agitation. This  
aggregation can still occur for particles carrying charges with the same sign if there are strong  
chemical or hydrophobic interactions between the particles. The intense agitation tends to force  
the particles  together,  which  can  overcome  the repulsion  between the  particles.  Once  this  
repulsive barrier is overcome the particles remain aggregated due to the strong chemical or  
hydrophobic interactions. Neutral oils like kerosene can also be added to help strengthen and  
form these aggregates.
In principle it could be possible to selectively aggregate particles of a certain mineral with low  
surface charge from other minerals with higher charges by the technique of shear aggregation. It 
is likely that the particles with a lower surface charge would require lower levels of agitation for  
aggregation  than  the  particles  with  higher  charges.  This  means  that  potentially  we  could  
selectively aggregate particles by varying the agitation speed. The aggregates or flocs once  
formed by shear aggregation/flocculation are normally tough enough to withstand the turbulence  
in mineral processing plants, and if hydrophobic they can be floated [ 22]. Long periods of intense  
agitation tends to produce more compact, rounded aggregates or flocs. If the agitation is too  
intense the larger aggregates or flocs will be broken up. 
Shear aggregation can be used to attach the fines to the coarser particles in carrier flotation. The  
aggregates  or  flocs  produced  by shear  aggregation  can  float  at  rates  similar  to  those  of  
intermediately sized particles. 
High intensity conditioning (HIC) is known to enhance the flotation recovery, grade and kinetics of 
the fine particles [references within 31]. One HIC mechanism thought to increase the flotation  
rate is cleaning of gangue slimes  and oxidation products from  the surface of  the valuable  
particles. Another proposed mechanism is the selective agglomeration of particles through HIC,  
which increases the effective size and floatability of the valuable fines [ 32].
HIC  has  been  shown  to  increase  the  flotation  rate  of  fine  galena  at  higher  collector  
concentrations without compromising galena selectivity against sphalerite [ 32]. The flotation of 
17gold fines in tailings is also improved using HIC prior to flotation [ 31]. In the case of these gold  
fines the flotation selectivity and kinetics were enhanced as a result of aggregation of gold fines  
followed by carrier flotation.
HIC has also been shown to improve the flotation of pentlandite from a nickel ore [ 33]. HIC 
increased the flotation rate of the 8 to 75 μm particles but did not increase the flotation rate of  
particles less than 8 μm. The changes observed after HIC were similar in many ways to those  
observed after desliming of the slurry which had a greater beneficial effect than HIC. The HIC  
was able to remove hydrophilic gangue slimes from both the pentlandite and gangue mineral  
surfaces [34]. The amount removed depended on the agitation intensity and time.
1.3.4 Bubble Size
The average bubble size in existing flotation cells is of the order of 655  μm [23]. There is 
evidence that bubble-particle collection efficiency and flotation rate increase with decreasing  
bubble size [23,  26]. These observations are consistent with the increase in available bubble  
surface area which occurs as bubble size decreases. In addition, the pressure inside a bubble  
increases inversely with bubble diameter, so smaller bubbles present air in a higher energy state  
than large bubbles. The high energy air in small bubbles is more likely to interact with surfaces in  
order to produce  a  lower  energy particle-bubble combination.  As  previo usly stated  the  low  
flotation rate and recovery of fine hydrophobic particles is predominantly due to their low collision  
efficiency with bubbles. A decrease in the bubble size can increase this collision efficiency and  
therefore increase flotation rates. The flotation rate of fines is highest using small bubbles (less  
than 100 μm) at low to moderate stirrer speeds [ 23]. The Concorde Cell uses smaller bubbles  
and has recently been reported to give a flotation rate of the order of one hundred times that of a  
mechanical cell [35]. 
There are some disadvantages to using small bubbles; these include long flotation times and  
increased gangue entrainment [ 26]. The higher water recoveries when small bubbles are used  
lead to the higher gangue entrainment. To obtain high grades it is essential that as much of this  
entrained gangue as possible drains back into the pulp from the froth. For example a high grade  
iron ore concentrate from fines was obtained using cationic reverse flotation with controlled use  
of wash water to remove the entrained fine iron mineral particles from the froth [ 36]. 
1.3.5 Separate Flotation of Fines
The reason that fines do not float well in many process circuits is because they are mixed with  
coarse particles and composites. Fine and coarse particles typically do not float well together in  
the same cell because they each require different conditions for optimum flotation. Fines lost to  
tails are often there because they were not made hydrophobic enough, either through insufficient  
18collector or through a hydrophilic surface coating. The degree of hydrophobicity required for  
maximum floatability tends to increase with particle size [ 21]. Where a range of sizes is present  
there is no single collector addition which will be appropriate for all the sizes. A certain surface  
coverage will be required to attain a level of hydrophobicity to give good floatability. The high  
coverage requirements of the coarsest particles may not be met when a substantial amount of  
fines are present. This fine material will consume reagent in proportion to its increased surface  
area. For fine particles the critical level of hydrophobicity required for flotation is easily exceeded,  
since coverages of less than 5 % are sufficient to produce recognisable flotation [ 21].
Fines can be floated to high recoveries if attention is paid to the surface chemistry, solution  
chemistry, classification and materials handling. For example, the use of clean mineral surfaces  
produced with inert grinding media can transform the flotation performance of fines compared  
with conventional grinding with steel media [ 37]. The selection of a suitable flotation environment  
is a compromise between the differing requirements of all the particles present. This means that  
the conditions will not be optimal for any of  the individual sizes including the fines. These  
limitations can be alleviated by using separate circuits for fine, intermediate and coarse particles  
[21].  Optimising  the  collector/depressant  combination  for  both  fine  and  coarse  fractions  in  
different streams has been shown to improve the flotation rate coefficient [reference in 32].The 
use of separate circuits has been generally overlooked in the push for circuit simplification and  
the use of larger flotation cells. There is also the possibility of using small bubbles to float fines in  
one circuit and a separate circuit using larger bubbles for the flotation of the intermediate/coarser  
particles [23]. 
There are operations, for example the Xstrata McArthur River and Mt Isa operations, that are  
able to efficiently float their fine material [ 37]. The high recoveries are not due to changes in  
flotation mechanisms but rather getting the right degree of liberation and adjusting the surface 
chemistry. The surfaces  of  fines are  sensitive to oxidation and surface  precipitates. These  
operations use inert grinding media to produce clean surfaces  and they minimise the time  
between grinding and flotation to increase the flotation efficiency of the fines.
1.3.6 Magnetic Methods
Magnetic carrier methods use the adsorption of magnetic reagent or the attachment of magnetite  
onto the particles to be separated to make them more magnetic. A particle with as little as 1 % or  
less of a magnetic material such as magnetite can show a dramatic increase in its magnetic  
response. Calculated volume contents of only 0.01 to 0.1 % of magnetite were enough to make a  
normally non-magnetic material become sufficiently magnetic to be separated by a conventional  
high intensity magnetic separator [ 38].
There are two methods for attaching magnetic materials to non-magnetic particles [ 38]. One 
19involves a magnetic reagent which is a composite of magnetic materials and surface active  
agent. The surface active agent has functional groups that can interact with magnetic and non-
magnetic materials. The second method involves hydrophobic magnetic agglomeration. This  
requires highly selective surfactants or chemicals with functional groups with an affinity for the  
target surface in a mixture. Both the magnetite carrier and particles to be attached need to be  
made hydrophobic. Finally high agitation is used to induce hydrophobic agglomeration between  
the  particles.  The  magnetic  carrier  method  has  been  shown  to  increase  c oal recovery  by 
approximately 5 % over conventional flotation [38].
Magnetic flocculation is another technique that can be used to aggregate mineral fines [ 39]. Fine 
magnetic particles are induced to aggregate or flocculate making them easier to float. For the  
particles to aggregate they must be at least partially magnetic. Ferromagnetic particles, such as  
magnetite, are easily magnetised and flocculate using relatively low intensity magnetic fields. For  
paramagnetic particles which are not as easily m agnetised, the application of high  intensity 
magnetic fields is required to induce flocculation. Diamagnetic materials which are non -magnetic 
do not flocculate on application of a magnetic field. 
Plant trials have shown that magnetic flocculation can improve the recoveries of fine chalcopyrite  
and gold [40, 42], pentlandite [41] and sphalerite [42]. The increased recoveries occur in the fine  
fractions (less than 20 μm), with improvements of approximately 2 % and 3.5 % for copper and  
gold,  respectively;  0.85%  for  pentlandite  and  3.8%  for  sphalerite.  This  particular  magnetic  
conditioning method (ProFlote ®) uses permanent rare earth magnets to generate the magnetic  
field and is currently in use at some sites. 
Other  examples  where  magnetic  methods  have  been  applied  include  iron  oxide/silica  and  
gibbsite/quartz systems.  Haematite and magnetite can co-flocculate whilst leaving the silica  
dispersed. The resultant magnetic flocs c an be magnetically separated from the silica [ 38]. Fine 
gibbsite (2 to 20 μm) was co-flocculated with magnetite using a high molecular weight anionic  
polyacrylamide while the quartz remained dispersed. A magnetic separator was used to recover  
the gibbsite at a recovery of 87.1 % from a feed grade of 39.6 %.
A factor that should be kept in mind with any of these magnetic methods  is the potentially high 
capital and operational costs involved with maintaining a high intensity magnetic field.  Although 
where permanent rare earth magnets are used to generate the magnetic fields (e.g. ProFlote ®) 
the operational costs would be reduced.
1.3.7 Other Potential Methods
A method not involving a particle-bubble collision step has been suggested. Using this method a  
mixture of graphite (hydrophobic) and quartz (hydrophilic) particles were selectively separated by  
direct contact with an air-water interface [ 43]. It was shown that a scale up of the process from a  
20simple batch to a continuous process was possible. For the continuous process a satisfactory 
selectivity for this one stage separation was obtained with the efficiency dependent  on the area of 
the air-water interface.
The vacuum or pressure release flotation method also does not involve a direct bubble-particle  
collision mechanism. In this case the gas is precipitated onto the particle to be floated. This  
method can be used to float very fine particles and has been used to remove fine solids in water  
clarification. At the moment there is no evidence that it is successful with selective separations  
[21]. 
A  method  involving  the  use  of  vibration  to  improve  flotation  performance  has  also  been  
suggested. This technique utilises high frequency vibrations on a deformable wall in contact with  
the pulp to reduce the flotation time and quantity of air expended [ 44]. This technique has the  
potential to  increase  the  agglomeration  and  particle-bubble  collision  efficiency  of  the  fines  
present.             
Finally, increasing  the  flotation  time  will  normally  increase  the  fines  recovered  [ 21].  The 
disadvantage is that it will also increase the amount of fine gangue recovered. Extending the time  
of flotation  was reported to increase  the amount of fine pentlandite recovered but  reduce the 
selectivity. Changing the type of collector and doubling its concentration in  a conditioning stage  
for fine pentlandite did not improve the recovery. The fine pentlandite was quite non-responsive  
and if very high recoveries were to be achieved there appeared to be  no choice but to float for a  
long time which would have decreased  the grade [45].
1.4. Sulfide Surface Oxidation
Sulfide mineral surfaces are heterogeneous in nature [reference in 7] and have both hydrophilic  
and hydrophobic sites on the surface. The relative amounts of these sites will affect the contact  
angle and floatability of the mineral. The sulfide surface may also be fractured or fissured giving  
both a chemically and an energetically heterogeneous surface. An example is the chalcopyrite  
surface which can have both hydrophobic patches (sulfur based entities) and hydrophilic patches  
(hydroxides) [46]. The floatability will be determined by the relative amounts of these hydrophobic  
and hydrophilic patches on the mineral surface. There may also be differences between the  
relative amounts of these hydrophobic and hydrophilic patches with particles of varying size. If  
more  hydrophilic  groups  are  present  on  the  fine  particles  compared  with  the  intermediate  
particles then, even with a high collector concentration, the net hydrophobicity of the fine particles  
could be less than the intermediate particles [ 32].
Sulfides are not stable in air and are readily oxidised. Thermodynamically they are expected to  
react immediately on exposure to air. The oxidation rate for sulfides depends on the surface area  
21available for reaction, the type and composition of the sulfide, the solution pH, the temperature  
and the partial pressure of oxygen [ 7]. The oxygen concentration in a pulp varies depending on  
where it is in the process. For example it is often low after grinding in a steel mill and higher after  
being pumped or aerated. It has been reported that the oxygen concentration can vary from  
about 5 mg/L up to 10 mg/L [ 3].
It is believed that the early stages in oxidation of a sulfide mineral may involve the progressive  
removal of metal atoms leaving behind either a metal deficient sulfur-rich surface layer or an  
elemental sulfur layer [ 1]. These sulfur rich areas would make the surface hydrophobic and can  
lead to the collectorless flotation of some sulfides such as chalcopyrite [ 8, 19]. This effect is most 
pronounced  at  acidic  pH  values  and  most  studies  show it  does  not  occur  under  alkaline  
conditions. In descending order, the collectorless floatability for some sulfides has been given as  
chalcopyrite, galena, pyrrhotite, pentlandite, covellite, bornite, chalcocite, sphalerite, pyrite and  
arsenopyrite [7]. The floatability of the first four sulfides is strong and differences are only slight.  
The last four all show very little collectorless floatability, with their relative ranking dependent on  
the quantity of frother present. In general, the less easily oxidised the sulfide the more readily it  
floats without a collector. However, we have found some literature results which do not fit with the  
above trend relating the 'rest potential' (natural pulp E h) with collectorless floatability [ 7].  The 
excessive oxidation of the sulfur rich areas would pr oduce thiosalts and finally sulfate, making  
the surface less hydrophobic.
It has been proposed that the dissolved metal atoms from a sulfide mineral re-adsorb onto the  
sulfide surface as metal hydroxides [ 4, 47, 48, 49]. The adsorption of insoluble or partly soluble  
metal hydroxides onto the sulfide surface will lead to the surface assuming the surface properties  
of the hydroxide (hydrophilic) [ 6,  50,  51,  52]. The adsorption of these metal hydroxides  onto 
sulfide mineral surfaces in plant pulps interferes with the flotation and in general they interact  
indiscriminately with the minerals [ 46].
The  depressant  effects  of  insoluble hydroxides  have  been known  for  some  time  [ 53].  For 
example chalcopyrite and pentlandite are easily depressed by metal hydroxides [ 46, 54].  For the 
chalcopyrite  complete  floatability  could  be  restored  at  pH  9  by  adding  enough  
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to dissolve the metal hydroxides formed. The metal  
hydroxide formed could also be dissolved by acidifying the solution. The xanthate added to these  
chalcopyrite systems more or less behaved in a conventional manner interacting with those  
surfaces not coated by insoluble metal hydroxide [ 46]. In the case of  pentlandite, samples  
oxidised for the longest period of time showed the lowest pentlandite recovery [ 54]. Also samples 
oxidised after grinding showed significantly greater losses of 8.0 to 24.6% pentlandite compared  
with 0.8 to 3.5% for those oxidised before grinding. This may have been because the grinding  
exposed clean and less oxidised surfaces. As well as the reduced pentlandite recovery after  
oxidation a higher pyrrhotite recovery was obtained for the oxidised samples. The oxidation of  
22pentlandite leads to the enrichment of iron and oxygen at the surface [ 55,  56]. The rates of 
oxidation for nickel and iron differ, with iron being more rapidly oxidised in the early stages of  
oxidation. 
The type of grinding media used can affect the degree of metal hydroxide contamination of the  
sulfide. The iron hydroxide formed from the oxidation of steel grinding media can depress the  
mineral floatability. The galvanic coupling of the steel grinding media with the sulfide minerals  
can accelerate this oxidation of the steel media, as will increasing the ionic strength of the  
solution  [57].  Using  a  more  inert  grinding  media  can  prevent  this  iron  hydroxide/oxide  
contamination of the mineral surfaces. For example the surface of galena after grinding with a  
high chromium alloy steel media was more hydrophobic than when a high carbon steel media  
was used [57]. The use of ceramic media rather than steel media can reduce this contamination  
even  further.  An  example  is  the  greatly  improved  copper  grade-recovery  relationship  and  
selectivity against pyrite using inert grinding media [ 57]. 
It has been reported that pyrite, unlike other sulfide minerals,  does not show a significant  
difference when milled using a mild steel or more inert grinding media. Since pyrite is the most  
readily oxidised  of  the  common  sulfide  minerals  it  has  been  suggested  that  the  reducing  
conditions created in mild steel mills have little effect on the subsequent behaviour of pyrite . 
Because pyrite is easily oxidised, the selectivity of pyrite in the presence of other sulfides has  
been enhanced through the use of nitrogen [ 2].
Due the larger available surface area of fine materials they are particularly susceptible and  
influenced by surface oxidation. Fine particles are also less subject to diffusion limitations which  
can slow down the transport of oxygen and other dissolved species during oxidation reactions.  
For these reasons, fine particles  can undergo a higher level of oxidation which results in the  
eventual adsorption of more metal hydroxide species. This makes fine particle flotation more  
susceptible to iron contamination emanating from grinding media [ 20,  51]. It has also been 
reported that the iron oxidation species from grinding media show a greater affinity for fine  
particles [57]. This acts to further depress the flotation of these fine sulfides and is in addition to  
the already lower flotation recoveries due to their size.
The flotation of fine fractions can be increased by not using mild steel grinding media [ 20, 37, 
57]. An example is the increased recovery of fine chalcopyrite particles using ceramic media [ 57]. 
In this case, a lack of adsorption of thiol collectors onto chalcopyrite is the main reason for the  
depression of chalcopyrite by the iron hydroxide. The hydrophilic iron hydroxide layers on the  
chalcopyrite do not interact with the collector at neutral to alkaline pH. 
A reversal of this detrimental oxidation of the sulfide mineral surface can be achieved in some  
cases  using sulfidisation  [ 58].  Sulfide and hydrosulfide ions  in solution could  potentially be  
oxidised to elemental sulfur and polysulfides, depending on the pH, and these could deposit onto  
23the mineral surface making it hydrophobic. The sulfidisation of an oxidised chalcopyrite surface  
leads to formation of copper sulfide like species as well as polysulfides and elemental sulfur on  
the  surface.  However,  the  complete  remediation  of  the  oxidised  pentlandite  surfaces  by  
sulfidisation was  not readily achievable. When sulfidised  in the presence  of  other oxidised  
sulfides, particularly pyrrhotite, the sulfidisation of adsorbed iron hydroxides formed pyrrhotite-like  
and possibly pyrite-like surfaces.
Other potential methods  of  removing  the oxidation products  from  a  sulfide surface  include  
sonication, attrition by quartz, pH adjustment and the use of complexing species like EDTA [ 59].
1.5. Zeta Potential
The zeta potential (ζ) is a measure of the effective charge on a particle as it moves in a solution.  
When the particle moves, it drags along a close layer of solution and ions. The zeta potential is  
the field due to the particle charge and the ions in the surrounding layer of  adhering solution 
within the shear or slipping plane. The shear plane of a particle is commonly considered to be the  
effective particle surface in a solution. These features are shown in Figure 6.
The classical electrical double layer model incorporates a layer of strongly bound inner counter  
ions, called the Stern layer, on the charged particle surface along with a diffuse outer layer of  
counter ions. This model of the double layer is often referred to as the Gouy-Chapman-Stern  
model and is shown in Figure 7 along with a typical decrease in the potential with distance from  
the surface. The shear plane is normally considered to be at or close to the interface of the Stern  
and diffuse layers. For the thin double layers which occur in concentrated electrolyte solutions the  
potential decays rapidly over a short distance and so the zeta potential at the shear plane is  
small. At lower ionic strengths the potential decays over a larger distance and so the zeta  
potential at the shear plane is larger.

The zeta potential can be critical in controlling particle-particle interactions, rheological behaviour  
and reagent interactions. It can also provide information on the mineral surface chemistry and  
purity. Zeta potential measurements provide a good way of ascertaining adsorption mechanisms  
and conditions in systems [ 60]. Modifying the zeta potential is probably one of the best ways of  
achieving selectivity between minerals with similar surface properties [ 30].
Bubbles have a zeta potential which will affect the way they interact with mineral surfaces. It has  
been reported that the zeta potential of micro-bubbles, bubbles with diameters less than 50 μm, 
ranges from 20 mV at pH 2 to -120 mV at pH 11 [ 61]. Other studies have shown the zeta  
potential to be negative over this whole pH range [ 62] with a shift to more negative values on  
addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate [ 63]. Both the particle and bubble zeta potentials can affect the  
particle-bubble interactions which in turn will influence the flotation. The flotation rate constant  
was shown to decrease by an order of magnitude as the particle and bubble charge were  
doubled from 30 mV to 60 mV. In this system both the particles and bubbles had similar positive  
charges [64]. Increasing the zeta potential magnitudes increased the particle-bubble repulsion  
making particle-bubble attachment less likely.
If we neglect oppositely charged bubble and particle surfaces the maximum rate of flotation is  
obtained when both surfaces have a charge close to zero [ 65]. A zeta potential of close to zero  
may improve the flotation rate but would increase the agglomeration between different mineral  
species. As a rough rule for solutions of low salinity, zeta potentials in the range -15 to 15 mV are  
not sufficient to cause much repulsion [ 66]. We therefore require a zeta potential high enough to  
prevent agglomeration but not so high as to prevent bubble coalescence. A charge of 20 mV has  
25Figure 7:  Gouy-Chapman-Stern model and change in potential with distance from surface.
been suggested to be adequate for this purpose [ 23].
The zeta potential can give an indication of changes that may be occurring to the surface. For  
sulfide minerals the surface adsorption of metal hydroxides/oxides will alter the zeta potential [ 51, 
52, 67, 68]. The zeta potentials will shift towards those of the metal hydroxide/oxide in proportion  
to the amount present on the sulfide surface. The zeta potential will also have an effect on the  
adsorption of collector. For example cationic collectors would preferentially adsorb onto negative  
surfaces and anionic collectors would adsorb onto positive surfaces. This means that often the  
adsorption of a collector can be enhanced by modifying the zeta potential, which is typically  
achieved through adding potential determining ions or pH regulation [ 12].
Collectors are also able to adsorb onto a surface with the same charge by chemisorption. This  
involves a specific chemical interaction or bond being formed between the collector and the  
surface. For example chemisorbing anionic collectors can still adsorb onto a negatively charged  
surface unless the opposing charges are large. If the opposing charges are large enough the  
electrostatic repulsion can overcome the chemisorption. Whether collectors are physisorbed or  
chemisorbed they both have distinct effects on the zeta potential of the mineral [ 60]. An example 
is the shift of the zeta potential for galena to more negative values on addition of potassium amyl  
xanthate [28].
The  zeta  potential  can  be  used  to  determine  the  conditions  which  will  promote  fast  
agglomeration, settling and filtration rates. The point at which the zeta potential is at its minimum  
value  (zero)  is  known  as  the  isoelectric  point  (IEP).  It  is  at  this  point  that  the  maximum  
agglomeration, settling rate, filtration rate and slurry yield value would be expected. In general  
there is a good correlation between fast agglomeration and this minimum value for several  
mineral types [13, 66]. The agglomeration of particles will also increase the solid bed porosity  
which in turn increases its permeability [ 69].
When more than one mineral is present heteroagglomeration will occur at pH values between the  
isoelectric points of the two minerals, i.e. heteroagglomeration occurs if the two minerals are  
carrying opposite charges.  Particle agglomeration can also occur when both mineral surfaces  
have a small zeta potential (close to the isoelectric point, or in the presence of significant salt  
concentrations).  When  selective  removal  is  required,  agglomeration  of  the  mineral  species  
present is undesirable. To prevent this agglomeration, and to prevent the formation of potential  
slime coatings [70], the surfaces require relatively high zeta potentials of the same sign, greater  
than 40 mV [22] in magnitude. This gives enough repulsion between the particles to prevent their  
agglomeration. Agglomeration or sliming often occurs due to the electrostatic attraction between  
the particles of opposite charge [ 71]. Slime particle surface coverages as low as 10 % can  
decrease the flotation rate of a sulfide mineral by an order of magnitude [ 72]
The rheology of the slurry often correlates with the zeta potential, and can be used as an  
26indicative  measure  of  the degree  of  inter-particle  interaction  or  aggregation  in  a  pulp. F or 
example the maximum in the slurry yield value has been shown to occur at the isoelectric point  
for a sulfide mineral system [ 73]. The addition of metal ions, xanthates and slime particles all  
dramatically affect not only the zeta potential but also the pulp rheology [ 74].
So  far  we  have  restricted  the  discussion  to  zeta  potential  and  the  resultant  electrostatic  
interactions. Another important factor is the hydrophobic interaction th at occurs between surfaces 
at  short  separation  distances.  Aggregation  can  be  controlled  by  both  electrostatic  and  
hydrophobic interactions. These hydrophobic interactions can be one or two orders of magnitude  
larger than the electrostatic interactions [ 28]. A hydrophobic interaction was used to explain why  
the sphalerite zeta potential results do not correlate with the respective settling rate data [ 75]. A 
hydrophobic force was also used to explain the heteroagglomeration in a sphalerite-silica system  
[76]. For the sphalerite-silica systems the zeta potentials provided only a partial interpretation of  
the results. The heteroagglomeration occurred even when both minerals had negative zeta  
potentials. A hydrophobic attraction was also used to explain the increase in the slurry yield value  
at low pH in another sphalerite system [ 74].
When the zeta potential magnitude is low the surface is more hydrophobic. The increased  
particle-particle agglomeration and bubble-particle attachment at low zeta potentials are often  
attributed to the hydrophobic interactions between the surfaces.  Often a reduction in the  zeta 
potential magnitude is required for the particles to  approach  each  other more closely for the 
hydrophobic interactions to have an effect.
1.5.1 Pyrite (FeS2)
The isoelectric point of metal sulfides including zinc, cadmium, lead, nickel, mercury, copper,  
iron, cobalt, manganese, antimony, arsenic and molybdenum are all estimated to be between pH  
0.6 to 3.3, with most below pH 2 [ 77,  78]. At pH levels below the isoelectric point the sulfide  
surfaces will be positive and above the isoelectric point sulfides will have a negative charge, so  
for most practical applications sulfide minerals have a negative surface. Metal oxides, however,  
can  be  present  as  either  positive  or  negative  particles  depending  on  the  processing  pH.  
Compared with metal oxides the sulfides have isoelectric points that are largely independent of  
the nature of the metal cation in the solid [ 79]. The overall similarity between the various sulfides  
in the absence of potential determining ions suggests that the surface is dominated by the sulfur  
surface functional groups. This is in contrast to metal oxides and hydroxides where the surface is  
typically more stable (not subject to further oxidation) and so the metal oxide has a greater  
influence on the isoelectric point.
The zeta potential of an unoxidised pristine pyrite surface is negative over the entire pH 3 to 12  
range. The zeta potentials and isoelectric points of pyrite, and most other sulfides, are very  
27susceptible to any changes in surface oxidation. Exposing the pyrite to oxygen results in a  
reversal of the zeta potential from negative to positive at low pH. The dissolution of iron from the  
surface followed by electrostatic adsorption of p ositively charged iron species onto negatively  
charged surface sites on pyrite has been used to explain the zeta potential observations [ 47]. 
The reversal of zeta potential could also be due to iron hydroxide forming in solution at higher pH  
values and precipitating on the pyrite surface. The result is a zeta potential trend with pH which  
above pH 3 approaches that of an iron hydroxide as the pyrite is oxidise d. This means the 
isoelectric point for the pyrite moves to higher pH values and can be used as an indicator of the  
degree of surface oxidation. The formation of an oxide or hydroxide film on the pyrite surface  
makes it less hydrophobic and therefore less likely to float.  Figure  8 shows the typical zeta  
potential trend with pH on oxidation of a sulfide surface.
The adsorption of a collector onto the pyrite surface will also affect the zeta potential. The zeta  
potential becomes more negative with an increasing xanthate concentration [references within 6]. 
Zeta potential measurements have been used to show that low concentrations of xanthate  
cannot adsorb readily onto pyrite above pH 6 [ 6]. At pH values greater than pH 6 xanthate is  
mainly consumed due to the formation in solution and on the surfaces of less hydrophobic ferric  
dihydroxy  xanthate,  which  leads  to  the  poor  floatability  of  fine  pyrite.  The  zeta  potential  
relationship with pH for pyrite with and without xanthate was also used to develop a model  
involving the dissolution of iron from the surface followed by adsorption of iron hydroxide and iron  
hydroxide xanthate species [ 4]. It was postulated that various iron xanthate and iron hydroxide  
xanthate complexes are formed and adsorb onto the pyrite surface. These complexes contribute  
to the flotation of pyrite.

-veOften there is only a limited correlation between the zeta potential and the tendency of particles  
to adsorb organic molecules [ 10,  78]. In the interaction between the pyrite surface and both  
phosphorylated and low molecular weight organic molecules, the organic anions continue to  
adsorb when the pyrite surface is negative. In such cases, the adsorption of an organic anion can  
lead to a more negative zeta potential for the surface [ 10]. Under anaerobic conditions it has  
been speculated that the interactions between these organic solutes and pyrite are dominated by  
interactions with specific surface sites (thiol or iron surface sites), and that electrostatic forces  
were  less  important  [ 78,  80].  In  one  of  the  studies,  dissolved  metal  ions  enhanced  the  
interactions of the organic species with the pyrite surface [ 80]. This enhancement was attributed  
to either an alteration in the distribution of thiol and iron groups on the surface or the formation of  
ternary surface complexes. The shift in the pyrite surface charge to become more positive in the  
presence of metal ions did not appear to have been considered a significant factor in increasing  
the adsorption of the organic species. However, we would expect the addition of metal cations to  
reduce the negative surface charge, and in this way allow an increase in anion adsorption.
1.5.2 Chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2)
Like  pyrite  the  zeta potential of  chalcopyrite  is  affected  by the  surface  coverage  of  metal 
hydroxides  which  increases with pH. The isoelectric point of chalcopyrite  also behaves in a 
similar fashion to pyrite and  increases with the degree of oxidation [ 48]. The isoelectric point  of 
unoxidised chalcopyrite is at pH 2 and shifts to higher pH values on oxidation [ 20]. This means 
that the oxidation of chalcopyrite can result in a zeta potential sign change. This can then affect  
the adsorption of charged species onto the surface.
Zeta potential measurements were used in a heteroagglomeration study of chalcopyrite with  
pyrite [81]. Pyrite and chalcopyrite were both found to have positive zeta potentials up to their  
isoelectric points. In this particular investigation the isoelectric points of chalcopyrite and pyrite  
were  pH  5.5  and  pH  2.2,  respectively.  The  higher  than  expected  isoelectric  point  for  the  
chalcopyrite indicates that the surface may have been partially oxidised. The opposite zeta  
potential signs for the chalcopyrite and pyrite in the pH 2.2 to pH 5.5 range are the most likely  
reason for their agglomeration. This agglomeration was not only confirmed by the zeta potential  
measurements but also small scale flotation tests [ 81]. At pH 10 these two minerals do not  
heteroagglomerate in the presence of flotation collector. Under these conditions it is quite likely  
that both the chalcopyrite and pyrite have the same zeta potential sign and would repel each  
other rather than agglomerate.
Others have found that information on the oxidation of chalcopyrite, chalcocite, covellite, bornite,  
enargite and tennantite can be obtained using zeta potential measurements [ 82]. The observed 
changes in zeta potential with pH are consistent with the presence of a copper hydroxide layer  
covering a metal deficient sulfur rich surface. The extent of this copper hydroxide coverage  
29increases with oxidation conditions.
1.5.3 Pentlandite [(Fe,Ni)9S8]
There have not been a large number of zeta potential studies involving pentlandite, most likely  
due to the difficulty of obtaining pure pentlandite samples. In one investigation of a synthesised  
pentlandite  sample  the  isoelectric  point was  at  pH  4.5,  [ 83]  while  for  another  synthesised  
pentlandite  an  isoelectric  point  was  found  at  pH  8.6  [ 84].  Like  most  sulfide  minerals  the  
isoelectric point of pentlandite is likely to increase from a typical unoxidised value of pH 2 to the  
fully oxidised values associated with iron and nickel hydroxides. The isoelectric points of pH 4.5  
and pH 8.6 indicate a partially oxidised pentlandite surface. This oxidation of the pentlandite  
surface shifts the surface charge from a negative value to a slightly positive value at pH 9 [ 85].
Above pH 4 the zeta potential of the synthesised pentlandite shifted to more positive values after  
the addition of copper ions [ 84]. The positive zeta potential of the untreated pentlandite was used  
to rule out an electrostatic interaction with the positive copper ions, with the suggestion that the  
interaction was chemical in nature. However, electrostatic interactions could well have played a  
significant role through copper cations  interacting with heterogeneous charged sites  on the  
pentlandite surface. The copper ions were used in this study to show that they could enhance  
pentlandite recovery with xanthate ions at pH 4 and 9. Another study also showed that adding  
copper ions could increase the recovery of fine pentlandite but the addition caused a marked loss  
of selectivity [14].
The presence of fine serpentine minerals can interfere with pentlandite flotation [ 85]. The flotation 
depression caused by slime coatings of these minerals on pentlandite is controlled by the zeta  
potential differences between the slime and sulfide particles. Unoxidised pentlandite will normally  
have a negative zeta potential over most of the pH range and would therefore be expected to  
attract particles with a positive zeta potential. Serpentine minerals such as chrysotile and lizardite  
have positive zeta potentials up to pH 11 and form slime coatings on pentlandite [ 83, 85]. If these 
serpentine minerals are made to have a negative zeta potential they do not form a slime coating  
and flotation is not impeded. The addition of a reagent like carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC) can  
do this while leaving the pentlandite zeta potential relatively unchanged [ 83]. The introduction of  
CMC can depress talc and other rock mineral flotation and result in an improvement to de-
watering and filtering of the concentrate [ 15]. CMC and sodium hexametaphosphate (Calgon)  
have also been found to remove iron oxide slime coatings from galena and quartz particles [ 72]. 
Both can reverse  the charge  on the slime  particle leading to a net repulsion between the  
particles.
301.5.4 Saline and Hypersaline Process Water
In flotation plant practice, where high levels of dissolved salts are often experienced, high ionic  
strengths can influence both particle-particle and particle-bubble interactions. The process water  
quality is an essential variable to consider when optimising flotation. The process water can  
contain metal ions like calcium as well as sulfate, thiosulfate, trithionate and tetrathionate. All  
these  ions  can  influence  the  surface  chemistry  and  floatability  of  minerals  [ 86].  Calcium, 
thiosulfate and sulfate are all surface active at normal process pH [reference in  86] and can 
compete with xanthate for adsorption onto the surface of a mineral sulfide like pentlandite. Any  
residual collector in the process water can also affect the recovery of sulfides [ 87]. Increasing the 
concentration of simple electrolytes, like sodium chloride, will also have a significant effect on the  
zeta potential of the particles and bubbles present [ 62, 88, 89]. With a prior knowledge of the  
species that will be present in solution, particles and bubbles can be made to acquire a desired  
sign and magnitude of charge by adding the required amount of appropriate salts.
Flotation in a 10 % salt solution has been shown to promote the flotation of a fine nickel sulfide  
[90]. Electrolytes affect the flotation of sulfides in three ways: through improved dispersion, when  
slime coatings are a problem; through enhanced hydrophobicity by modifying the hydration layers  
around mineral particles and air bubbles; and through altering the water structure in a way which  
reduces the solubility for many of the slightly hydrophobic organic and sulfide species ("salting  
out"). The hydration layer is the adhered water/ion layer around a particle or bubble. Typically, the  
higher the ionic strength, the thinner this hydration layer. High recoveries of fine sphalerite, pyrite  
and chalcopyrite from the Red Sea (P 80 of 2 μm) were successfully floated at high ionic strength  
[90].  Other  investigators  have  also  found  saline  water  can  improve  fine  sulfide  flotation  
[references in 90]. 
At the Kambalda operation in Western Australia the nickel flotation is 2.5 times faster in circuit  
water than in local potable water, and the presence of salts in the circuit water was found to be  
the reason for the increased flotation rate [ 90]. The addition of sodium chloride was found to  
increase the diffusion of xanthate anions to the particle surface and increases the amount of  
collector adhering to it. In another investigation using process water containing 77.1 g/L dissolved  
solids, most of which was sodium chloride, the pentlandite recovery from the fine fraction was  
slower and 8 % lower than from the coarse fraction for the same flotation time [ 91].
High concentrations of salt (greater than 0.1 M sodium chloride) can increase the kinetics and  
yield of coal flotation without the addition of frother or collector [references within 92]. The higher 
floatability of coal at high ionic strength is not simply due to a reduction in the zeta potential  
magnitude  and  reduced  bubble-particle  repulsion  [ 93].  Single  bubble  experiments  at  salt  
concentrations more than 0.01 M indicate that the attractive hydrophobic force between the  
bubble and coal particle becomes stronger [ 93]. This may be due to "salting out" of the slightly  
water-soluble organic species which act as natural collectors in coal [ 94] or in combination with  a 
31reduction in the zeta potential.
The zeta potentials of coal particles and bubbles are negative in BHP Billiton Mt Keith operation  
bore water [95]. The bore water contained the following ions at significant levels : calcium, 
potassium, magnesium, sulfate, sodium and chloride. The predominant species was sodium  
chloride with a concentration of about 0.7 M. At approximately pH 8 the zeta potential for the coal  
was reduced from about -20 mV, in 0.001 M potassium chloride, to -7.84 mV in the bore water.  
The zeta potential of  the bubbles at the same  pH was  approximately -50 mV in 0.001 M  
potassium chloride. The reduction of the zeta potential magnitude at high electrolyte levels will  
reduce  the  repulsive  electrostatic  interaction.  This  means  that  the  hydrophobic  force  will  
dominate the bubble-particle interaction and enable bubble particle attachment to occur and a  
better flotation response. 
Improved flotation performance in saline water has been attributed to a greater number of small  
stabilised bubbles and a reduction of the particle-bubble electrostatic repulsion [ 95, 96, 97]. The 
bubble stabilisation effect at high salinities means that potentially less frother is required. The  
flotation performance is not always improved at high salinities. High ionic strengths result in  
greater froth stabilities which increases the mass pulls and water recoveries. The higher water  
recoveries at high ionic strength introduce more gangue into the final concentrate and therefore  
can lower the grade [ 98, 99].
1.6 Rheological Measurements
Rheological measurements provide us with an insight into the handling properties of a material.  
The rheology of  a sample is determined by the interparticle interactions and these can be  
influenced  by the  zeta  potential.  Therefore  modification  of  the  zeta potential can  alter  the  
rheology of a slurry or dispersion. As part of the current project, the rheological properties of yield  
stress, viscosity and elasticity were compared with the zeta potential results.
The yield stress is the minimum force required to cause the sample to flow. This can give an  
insight into the strength of the interparticle interactions. A previous investigation on a sulfide  
slurry has shown a correlation between yield stress and zeta potential [ 100]. In general, as the 
zeta potential magnitude decreases the yield stress increases. Similarly, the viscosity of the  
system can give an indication of the strength of the interparticle interactions. Like the yield stress  
the viscosity would be expected to increase as the zeta potential magnitude decreases. This is  
due to the reduced electrostatic repulsion between the particles.
As well as the yield stress and viscosity the elasticity of a system is also affected by the nature of  
the interparticle forces. The elasticity is normally described by the elasticity or storage modulus,  
G', which relates to the total energy stored in the elastic contributions. The loss or viscous  
32modulus G” relates to the dissipated energy due to material flow. 
In general, the larger the G' value the more a material acts as a solid, and tends to retain its  
shape when deforming forces are removed. Under these conditions, bonds tend to be deformed  
but not broken. On the other hand, the larger the G” value, the more the material acts as a 'thick'  
liquid, with flow being increasingly hindered as the magnitude of G” increases. Even at very high  
G”, deformation causes flow and irreversible changes to local linkages at a microscopic scale, as  
well as changes to shape at the macroscopic scale. In aqueous slurries this usually means that  
hydrogen bonds are being broken.
Both the elasticity modulus G' and the viscous modulus G” can be determined by dynamic  
oscillation measurements. Elasticity measurements can provide a great deal of information about  
the interparticle interactions within a slurry or dispersion including those of flocculated systems  
[101, 102]. Elasticity measurements have been used to determine the interparticle interactions  
during dewatering of flocculated kaolinite dispersions [ 103]. Faster dewatering occurred at higher  
values of G'. It was suggested that the G' potentially could be used as a diagnostic tool for  
predicting the relative effectiveness of flocculants.
Parallel data on both rheological properties and zeta potential will provide more comprehensive  
and useful information on  the systems to be investigated. The rheometer used for this work  
provided much more information than currently available from conventional viscometers, through  
both its higher sensitivity and the ability to measure slurry elasticity. Slurry v iscosity and yield 
stress measurements were correlated with zeta potential. The rheometer provided information on  
the  strength  or  degree  of  any particle  agglomeration  as  well  as  experimental  evidence  of  
changes  occurring within the slurry. There are few detailed comparisons  between the zeta  
potential and rheological properties for systems approaching industrial process conditions.

2.1 Zeta Potential and Sizing
The  zeta  potential  and  particle  sizing  measurements  were  recorded  using  a  Dispersion  
Technology DT1200 electroacoustic spectrometer, shown in Figure 9. The measurements were  
conducted under ambient conditions at temperatures between 24 to 27 °C. Typically 200 mL of  
sample was continually pumped around the DT1200 sample chamber using a peristaltic pump.  
Most samples had solid loadings between 15 to 20 weight percent and were prepared in either  
deionised  water,  sodium  chloride  solution  or  process  water.  The  sodium  chloride  solution  
concentrations ranged from 0.1 M up to 3 M. The dispersions were all sonicated for 5 minutes  
and pumped around the DT1200 sample chamber for approximately 5 minutes prior to any  
measurements. For the sizing measurements a  P80 size (80% of particles by mass less than this  
size) was used to determine whether a change in the particle size distribution had occurred.
For increased zeta potential accuracy the background due to the ions present was subtracted  
from the total recorded signal. This background subtraction becomes essential for background  
electrolyte levels greater than 0.1 M. The background was recorded either by collecting the  
supernatant at the end of the experiment or by using the solution the slurry was prepared in. The  
supernatant was collected by centrifuging at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes or allowing the solids to  
settle  then decanting the clear supernatant.  T he zeta potentials  in  this  report  have had a  
background correction applied as well as adjustments for the variations in sound speed, density  
and viscosity differences between the various background solutions used. The zeta potentials for 
a single point reading  were typically measured to a standard deviation of 0.2 mV or less.

2.2 Rheology Measurements
The rheology measurements were performed on a TA Instruments AR-G2 rheometer using a  
temperature  controlled  double  concentric  cylinder  system.  The  measurements  were  all  
conducted at 25°C with samples transferred from the DT1200 to the rheometer. Shear stress  
versus shear rate, dynamic oscillation and viscosity versus time measurements were run. From  
these measurements the  Casson yield points, viscosities and elasticities of the slurries were  
determined.
2.3 Materials
Sulfide ore and process water samples were supplied by the sponsors. The sulfide samples used  
included mill feed ore, drill core samples, cleaner-scavenger feed and sulfide concentrate. A high  
purity pyrite sample from Huanzala, Peru was also used and supplied by Ward's Natural Science  
Establishment. A chemical analysis of the sulfide samples was conducted by ALS Minerals using  
sodium peroxide fusion with ICPAES/ICPMS finish. The major species are given in Table 2. The 
calculated purity values in the Table are for either pyrite, chalcopyrite or pentlandite and are  
based on the analyses and ideal chemical formulae for each sulfide. The process water samples  
were analysed by ALS Environmental using ICPAES/ICPMS, titration, chloride discrete analyser  
and turbidimetric techniques. The results of the process water analyses are given in Table 3.

The  collectors  used were  sodium  ethyl xanthate (Orica),  potassium  amyl xanthate  (Orica),  
sodium isobutyl xanthate (Orica) and a modified thionocarbamate (Cytec). A 200 g/L solution of  
each xanthate collector in deionised water was prepared prior to the flotation tests and stored at  
approximately 5 °C between tests. The solutions were stored for no more than a week before  
fresh solutions were prepared. The frother used was methyl isobutyl carbinol supplied by Sigma  
Aldrich.
Wherever possible all other chemicals used were of analytical grade and in most cases were  
supplied by Sigma Aldrich. The non-sulfide solids in this work included 0.5 μm median particle  
sized haematite and 1 to 5 μm median particle sized silica. Sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric  
acid solutions were used for any pH adjustments.
362.4 Milling
Sulfide ore samples were initially crushed and pulverised to 85% passing 75 μm by ALS Minerals 
and then stored at -5 to -10  °C until required. Some of the samples received did not require  
crushing or pulverising and were simply stored until needed. The ore (65 g) was combined with  
35 mL of either deionised water, sodium chloride solution or process water and milled with 2.25  
kg of zirconium oxide grinding media (6 mm diameter balls) in a stirred ceramic mill (Figure 10). 
After 10 minutes of milling at 200 rpm more than 80% of the particles were less than 10 μm. The 
milled material was then transferred into a beaker using 210 mL of the background solution. This  
gave approximately 220 mL of slurry for the zeta potential, sizing and rheology measurements.  
The  weight  percentages  of  the  milled  sulfide  samples  were  determined  using  density  
measurements and drying small aliquots of the samples. Air was not excluded at any time during  
the milling or subsequent measurement processes.
2.5 Flotation
All flotation tests were conducted using the Metso Minerals Denver D-12 laboratory flotation  
machine with the 1.7 L capacity stainless steel tank (Figure 11). Solid loadings of 10 or 20 weight  
percent with a P85 of 75  μm were used for the majority of samples. The slurry volumes were  
approximately 1 L with the solids in either deionised water, 1 M sodium chloride, 3 M sodium  
chloride or process water.
The stirrer speed was 800 rpm; this was sufficient to keep the solids suspended and produce an  
air flow rate into the tank of approximately 5 L/min. The collector dosages used were either 25,  
50 or 100 g/t (grams per tonne of solids) and 25 g/t or 100 g/t MIBC was added. The slurries  
were conditioned with the collector/frother for 3 minutes prior to the introduction of the air and

commencement of flotation. The pH was adjusted to the required value prior to conditioning  
using either sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid solutions.
Concentrates were collected after cumulative times of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8 minutes. The froths were  
collected by continually scraping the top layer of the froth. The collected concentrates were  
weighed, dried at 80°C, re-weighed, then a chemical analysis conducted.

3. RESULTS
3.1 Pyrite
The effect of pH on the zeta potential, particle size and rheology of 20 weight percent pyrite  
(PYR-1) in deionised water was determined. A summary of the results from pH 3 to pH 12 is  
shown in Figures 12, 13 and 14.

pHP80 (μm)The zeta potential and P 80 for the pyrite did not significantly change as the pH was increased. A  
maximum for the viscosity and yield stress occurs around pH 8. The elasticity of the slurry also  
showed this same trend and maximum. The increased slurry viscosity, yield stress and elasticity,  
at high pH, coincide with known lower pyrite recoveries by flotation at high pH [ 6]. A typical 
recovery curve for pyrite with pH is shown in Figure 14. Particles with a zeta potential magnitude  
less than 20 to 30 mV will often agglomerate due to a lack of mutual repulsion. Although the zeta  
potential magnitude for the pyrite was well below 20 mV, which would suggest a high likelihood  
that  the  particles  would  agglomerate,  the particle  size  measurements  did  not  suggest  that  
agglomeration occurred.
As previously shown in Figure  8 the zeta potential for an ideal unoxidised sulfide surface will  
remain negative over the entire pH range. As the degree of oxidation increases this zeta potential  
will  shift  towards  more  positive  values,  especially under  acidic  conditions.  The  pyrite  zeta  
potential was negative across the whole investigated pH range. This is consistent with a pyrite  
surface that is mostly unoxidised.
The increases in viscosity, elasticity and yield stress of the pyrite slurry are most likely due to iron  
hydroxide formation as the pH is increased. The pH at which the maxima occur fits with the pH at  
which iron hydroxide would begin to precipitate. A small increase in the solids present through  
precipitation, or the precipitation of these solids on the sulfide surface, are both likely to affect the  
rheology. The change in the parameters, in particular the yield stress, were not large and this fits  
with the expected relatively small amount of precipitated solids that would form compared with  
40Figure 14: Effect of pH on pyrite (PYR-1) slurry yield stress and viscosity. Lines through the points are not  
mathematical fits and are given to show the trends. Typical trend for pyrite flotation recovery (dashed line).34.567.5910.51200.511.522.5

viscosity (cP)the total sulfide solids present. It appears that the rheology measurements were capable of  
picking up this small change while the zeta potential and sizing measurements were not.
Over a period of time, a small zeta potential change occurred for the pyrite surface in deionised  
water at pH 10. This shift to slightly more negative zeta potentials is shown in Figure 15 along 
with the associated particle size (P 80) values. As evident in the Figure, the size distribution did not  
change significantly. The slight shift in zeta potential with time to more negative values could be  
due to iron hydroxide being stripped from the pyrite surface as the slurry is pumped around the  
sample chamber. Even though the zeta potential magnitude has increased, this increase is  
unlikely to be sufficient to keep the particles fully dispersed and prevent any agglomeration.  
3.2 Chalcopyrite
The zeta potentials, particle sizes and rheology of 15 weight percent chalcopyrite (CHALC-2) in  
deionised water were measured over the range pH 5 to pH 12.  A summary of the results is  
shown in Figures 16 and 17. The chalcopyrite zeta potential shifts to more negative values as the  
pH increases. This trend, and the absence of an isoelectric point, is typical of unoxidised sulfide  
surfaces. The increasingly negative zeta potential at higher pH would be expected to lead to  
decreased rather than increased particle agglomeration. The magnitudes of the zeta potentials  
were less than 20 mV over the full pH range, and at this moderate potential particles commonly  
exhibit at least partial agglomeration. Nevertheless, particle size measurements suggested that  
agglomeration of the chalcopyrite was minimal, with less than a 0.5 μm P80  increase across the 
investigated pH range.

P80 (μm)Less surface oxidation is expected to occur for chalcopyrite compared with the pyrite . This higher 
level of oxidation in pyrite results in a lower initial pH and higher solution conductivity compared  
with the chalcopyrite system. The higher conductivity will contribute to the reduced zeta potential  
magnitude for the pyrite system compared to the equivalent chalcopyrite system.
The changes in elasticity and viscosity which occurred with changing pH for the chalcopyrite  
slurry in deionised water are shown in Figure 17. The yield stress was very low with values less  
than 0.1 Pa and the differences in viscosity and elasticity were also small. The decrease for both  
elasticity and viscosity at high pH could be due to the larger zeta potential magnitude (associated  
with  a higher  particle  charge).  This  would increase  the electrostatic  repulsion  between the  
chalcopyrite particles and could lower the viscosity and elasticity. Another possible explanation  
involves the formation of iron hydroxide. Some iron hydroxide will almost certainly form in these  
samples as the pH increases. This iron hydroxide, whether precipitated on the chalcopyrite  
surface or in solution, could affect the rheology. Less of it would form in these chalcopyrite  
samples compared with the previously discussed pyrite systems. The smaller amount of iron  
hydroxides formed in the chalcopyrite samples could explain the similar but smaller rheology  
changes observed for chalcopyrite compared with pyrite.
The observed yield stress and viscosity for the pyrite slurries were much higher than those  
observed for chalcopyrite slurries over the whole pH range. This is primarily due to the slightly  
higher solids content of the pyrite system (20 weight percent solids compared with 15 weight  
percent) but there are other factors involved. Firstly, the pyrite slurries had a higher conductivity

P80 (μm)due to oxidation of the pyrite. In addition, the greater oxidation of pyrite is likely to have produced  
a more hydrophilic surface, with stronger water-mineral interactions. Finally, the production of a  
separate amorphous iron hydroxide phase from oxidation of pyrite could help to bind the minerals  
and increase the mineral-mineral interactions.
3.3 Pentlandite
The zeta potential and sizing measurements for pentlandite samples in deionised water with solid  
loadings of between 15 to 20 weight percent are given in Figure 18.  The zeta potential and P 80 
did not significantly change over the investigated pH range. Each of the two pentlandite samples  
contained significant proportions of pyrite and/or pyrrhotite, which will have affected the zeta  
potential. The zeta potentials for the pentlandite samples were negative across the whole pH  
range, which suggests that the surfaces were unlikely to be fully oxidised. The zeta potentials  
were less negative than similar measurements for pyrite. The major difference between the  
pentlandite samples and the pyrite samples is the additional presence of both pyrrhotite and  
pentlandite, which results in an average zeta potential that is closer to zero. This shift to less  
negative zeta potentials for the pentlandite samples may be related to their oxidation products  
and the iron hydroxides formed at high pH. The particle size distributions did not significantly  
change for the pentlandite samples across the pH range and they were similar to the distributions  
recorded for the chalcopyrite and pyrite samples. The results did not show an increased particle  
agglomeration at a specific pH.

Haematite and silica are common in the slimes and gangue associated with the flotation feed.  
For comparison with the sulfides, the zeta potential, particle size distributions and rheology of  
haematite and silica slurries were determined. Figures  20,  21 and  22 show the results for 20  
weight percent haematite and 11 weight percent silica in deionised water. For the haematite, as  
the zeta potential approaches zero the viscosity increases. The increase in viscosity is due to the  
reduced repulsion between the haematite particles. However, any reduced inter-particle repulsion  
resulted in less than 0.2  μm increase in the haematite particle size (P 80), i.e. no significant 
agglomeration of the haematite particles was observed.
As the pH was increased from pH 4 to pH 12 for silica, the silica zeta potential shifted to larger  
negative values and the particle size (P 80) decreased. A greater degree of agglomeration for  
silica was observed at lower pH where the zeta potential magnitude was smaller. The increase in  
particle size at low pH was approximately 1.2 μm.
As the sulfides are oxidised and more iron oxide/hydroxide products are formed or adsorbed onto  
the sulfide surface the zeta potential trend with pH would be expected to approach the trend for  
haematite shown in Figure 22. A positive zeta potential under acidic conditions is one indication  
of a heavily oxidised sulfide surface. The silica surface, like the sulfide surface, had a negative  
zeta potential across the whole pH range, but the zeta potentials for silica were much larger at  
high pH than those of the sulfides. The source of the negative zeta potentials for silica are silanol  
groups (Si-OH) on the surface which can de-protonate to form  Si-O- groups. These silanol  
groups make the silica surface hydrophilic. The zeta potential for an unoxidised sulfide surface is

P80 (μm)also expected to become more negative as the pH increases. This did not occur with the pyrite  
and pentlandite, probably because of the presence of metal hydroxides in the samples. 
Based only on the zeta potentials, heteroagglomeration between silica and sulfide particles is  
unlikely to occur since both have the same charge. Inter-particle repulsion between the silica and  
sulfide will decrease the chances of the particles combining. This would also be the case for  
haematite and sulfide particles at high pH. However, at low pH where haematite has a positive  
zeta potential some heteroagglomeration is possible. A certain amount of heteroagglomeration  
may also occur in regions where the zeta potential magnitudes are small.

We examined the effects of calcium, copper, zinc, magnesium, iron, carbonate and sulfate ions  
on the zeta potential of pyrite (PYR-1), chalcopyrite (CHALC-2 and CHALC-3) and pentlandite  
(PENT-4). In each case, the solids were dispersed in deionised water. The concentrations of the  
ions added to the milled slurries were 0.032 M (1.3 g/L) calcium, 0.018 M (1.7g/L) sulfate and  
0.01 M (0.6 g/L) carbonate. These ions were dosed as either calcium chloride solution, sodium  
sulfate or sodium carbonate solids.  Copper, zinc and magnesium ions were added up to levels of 
0.25 g/L using metal sulfate solutions. The ferric ions were dosed in at approximately 0.005 M  
(0.28 g/L) using solid ferric chloride hexahydrate.
At these concentrations the calcium, sulfate and carbonate ions did not have a large effect on  
either the zeta potential, particle size or rheology of the pyrite or chalcopyrite slurries. The  
addition of calcium ions did change the sign of the zeta potential for a pentlandite containing  
slurry from a negative to a positive value, and these results are shown in Figure 23. The shift of 
the zeta potential to more positive values is due to the adsorption of either calcium ions, calcium  
hydroxide cations (CaOH+) or calcium hydroxide solid depending on the pH. A similar zeta  
potential shift due to calcium was not observed for pyrite or chalcopyrite. The addition of calcium  
did not have a large effect on either the particle size or rheology of the pentlandite samples.  
The addition of 0.25 g/L copper, zinc and magnesium ions did not have a large effect on the  
pyrite zeta potential, particle size or rheology at either pH 7 or pH 10. The addition of copper and  
magnesium ions also did not significantly affect the chalcopyrite results. The addition of zinc ions  
at concentrations of 0.25 g/L did shift the zeta potential of chalcopyrite from -7.3 mV to -6.8 mV

pHzeta potential (mV)at pH 7. Zinc ions had the opposite effect on the chalcopyrite zeta potential at pH 10 shifting it to  
a more negative value, from -11.4 mV to -14.3 mV. The shift in the zeta potential at pH 7 is most  
likely due to the adsorption of positive zinc/zinc hydroxide cations. At pH 10, the formation of  
anionic zinc hydroxides and the zincate anion ( Zn(OH) 42- ) can cause the shift to more negative  
zeta potentials. The slightly more negative zeta potential of sulfides at pH 10 after addition of zinc  
ions also suggests that the sulfides become less hydrophobic.
The effect of iron cations on the zeta potential of chalcopyrite (CHALC-3) in deionised water is  
shown in Figure 24. Approximately 0.005 M (0.28 g/L) ferric ions (Fe3+) were added to the milled  
sample using solid ferric chloride hexahydrate. The zeta potential shifted to a less negative value  
and the sample elasticity increased slightly on addition of ferric ions. The increase of the elasticity  
at the minimum in the zeta potential magnitude is consistent with a stronger interaction between  
the sulfide particles, due to reduced electrostatic repulsion.
There are several possible reasons for the shift of the zeta potential to a less negative value in  
measurement 2. They include the decrease in pH (due to the addition of acidic ferric ions) from  
an initial adjusted value of pH 9.7 down to pH 5.3. In addition, ferric ions can act as a mild  
oxidising agent, and oxidation of the sulfide surface could shift the zeta potential to slightly less  
negative values. Adsorption of the positive ferrous ions (Fe+2) at pH 5.3 onto the chalcopyrite  
surface would also shift the zeta potential to less negative values. Finally, the slight increase in  
the ionic strength of the solution would also act to lower the zeta potential magnitude. All these

max G'(Pa)factors may have had an impact on the zeta potential of chalcopyrite.
On adjusting the pH back up to the initial value of approximately pH 10 (measurement 3 in Figure  
24) the zeta potential shifts back to a value only slightly less negative than the initial value. The  
increase in pH would cause the precipitation of iron hydroxide. This solid formation did not  
significantly change the zeta potential, suggesting the precipitate  most  likely formed  in the  
solution rather than directly on the chalcopyrite surface. If most of the precipitation was on the  
chalcopyrite surface, a larger zeta potential difference would have occurred. On adding a similar  
amount of haematite solid as would be expected from precipitation of ferric ions at pH 10 (1.6  
g/L, measurement 4 in Figure 24), no significant change was recorded. These observations are  
consistent with pH being the dominant factor in affecting the zeta potential for chalcopyrite, and  
the iron hydroxide precipitation occurring in the solution rather than on the sulfide surface.
3.6 Effect of Xanthate, Humate and Quaternary Ammonium Compounds
The effects of sodium ethyl xanthate and potassium amyl xanthate on approximately 18 weight  
percent pyrite in deionised water at pH 7 and pH 10 were investigated. Each collector was dosed  
in at two levels, approximately 240 g/t and 1200 g/t. For both collectors only a small shift in the  
zeta potential was observed at the higher dosage level. This shift was to a more negative value  
and only approximately 1 mV. The trends and shifts were the same at either pH 7 or pH 10 and a  
significant change in the particle size distribution and rheology was not observed.
The addition of the quaternary ammonium compound cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)  
shifted the zeta potential of pyrite (PYR-1), chalcopyrite (CHALC-3) and pentlandite (PENT-5)  
samples to more positive values (Figure 25). These samples had a solid loading of approximately  
20 weight percent and were maintained at pH 10. The results show that the pyrite and pentlandite  
samples both required an increased amount of CTAB to shift the zeta potential to a positive value  
compared with the chalcopyrite sample. Given the initial zeta potentials were relatively similar for  
the sulfides, this suggested that  the CTAB adsorbs more strongly to the chalcopyrite surface.  
This could be due to an increased hydrophobicity of the chalcopyrite surface compared with the  
other sulfides. A more hydrophobic surface would be expected to adsorb more of the CTAB  
compared with a relatively hydrophilic surface.  The concentration required to shift the zeta  
potential from negative to positive was similar for both the pentlandite and pyrite samples. The  
pentlandite sample contains a significant amount of iron sulfides which could be a contributing  
factor  to  the  similarity  of  the  zeta  potential  data  for  the  pentlandite  and  pyrite  samples.  
Alternatively, the oxidation products present on the sulfide surfaces may be similar for the pyrite  
and pentlandite  samples, and different for the chalcopyrite.
49The particle size (P80) increased only slightly with the addition of CTAB, and this increase was  
only observed at the very highest CTAB concentration of 1000 ppm. The P 80 values for the 
chalcopyrite and pentlandite samples only increased by approximately 0.2  μm while the P80 
increase for the pyrite was larger at 2 μm. These results suggest that the addition of CTAB does  
not cause the unoxidised sulfides to undergo a high degree of agglomeration. Although the  
particle size did not show a large change, measured values of the viscosity, elasticity and yield all  
increased as the zeta potential approached a value of zero. The greatest changes were for the  
chalcopyrite sample and some of these results are shown in Figure 26. This increase could be  
due  to  the  lower  electrostatic  repulsion  between  the  particles  when  the  zeta  potential  is  
minimised, and the subsequent formation of a weak structure in the slurry. Although the zeta  
potential was minimised, an increased agglomeration of the sulfides was not apparent from the  
sizing data. It is possible that other non-electrostatic forces were acting to keep the particles from  
agglomerating. In this case, with the addition of CTAB it could have been a steric effect from the  
CTAB on the surface that acted to prevent the particles from agglomerating.
Humate had a negligible effect on the zeta potential of the sponsors' ores in 1 M sodium chloride  
at basic pH. The humate was dosed in at 50 ppm and 200 ppm and the zeta potentials shifted by  
less than 1 mV towards more negative values. Humate did not significantly change the particle  
size distribution and only slightly reduced the viscosity, yield and elasticities of the samples.

The zeta potential of pyrite (PYR-1) with an increasing sodium chloride concentration is pH  
dependent (Figure 29). At pH 7, increasing the sodium chloride concentration caused an initial  
shift  to a more  negative value before  the zeta potential became  slightly less  negative  and

differ substantially from that of pyrite dispersed in deionised water. At pH 10, pyrite exhibited a  
positive zeta potential at high salinity levels, which was most likely due to a charge reversal of  
negative metal oxide and hydroxide species on the sulfide surface. Metal oxides and hydroxides  
normally have a positive zeta potential when under high ionic strength conditions [ 88, 89]. Iron 
hydroxychloride/chloride species at pH 7 may also have contributed to the different zeta potential  
observations for pH 7 and pH 10 at high salinity.
A summary of  the results  involving pyrite (PYR-1),  chalcopyrite (CHALC-2) and pentlandite  
(PENT-4) samples in low and high salinity process waters are shown in Tables 4 and 5. All the 
samples had solid loadings between 15 to 17 weight percent. The low salinity process water  
(PW-3) had a chloride concentration of 1400 mg/L while the high salinity process water (PW-4)  
had a chloride level of approximately 44000 mg/L.

Generally the zeta potential decreased in magnitude on going from low to high salinity process  
water for all three sulfide samples. There was also a change in sign for the neutral and basic  
values. This change in sign suggests that at a specific salinity between these two extremes the  
zeta  potential would  be  zero  and  at  this  point the  repulsion  between the  particles  will  be  
53minimised. The higher P 80 values in the high salinity process water indicate a slightly greater  
degree of agglomeration, most likely due to the reduction in the zeta potential magnitude.
The trends are also consistent with metal oxide/hydroxides in the samples and on the sulfide  
surfaces. The positive zeta potentials at neutral and basic pH for the samples in high salinity  
process water are most likely due to the presence of metal oxide/hydroxides. Under acidic  
conditions the zeta potential remains negative in the high salinity process water. Under these  
acidic conditions the oxide/hydroxides are likely to at least partially dissolve leaving a “clean”  
essentially  unoxidised  sulfide  surface.  The  results  suggest  that  the  zeta  potential  of  an  
unoxidised metal sulfide surface is less sensitive to changes in salinity than the equivalent metal  
oxide/hydroxide surface. 
3.8 Sulfide Ores in Process Water
Zeta potentials, particle size distributions and rheology of the sponsors' ores were measured in  
the sponsors' process water. Figure 30 shows the zeta potential results for the investigated pH  
range. The majority of samples had a solid loading of approximately 20 weight percent.
The zeta potentials for all the ores in high salinity process water were positive, while zeta  
potentials in low salinity process water were negative. A positive zeta potential at high salinity  
was also observed for the sulfides in sodium chloride solutions (see Figure  27). The sodium

pHzeta potential (mV)chloride concentration in the process water appears to be the dominant factor influencing the  
zeta potential rather than any of the other ions present. 
The particle size distribution for the ores in process water did not significantly change as the pH  
was increased. The P 80 increased only slightly, by less than 0.6 μm, as the pH was increased.  
The rheological properties  of the samples were also similar,  with only small increases in the  
viscosities, elasticities and yield stress points occurring for most samples as pH increased. 
The sizing results suggest that large , stable agglomerated particles are not forming in the high  
salinity process waters. The non-zero positive zeta potential  may help to prevent  significant 
agglomeration of the sulfides in the saline process waters , but this is unlikely  to be the main 
factor given the relatively small magnitudes of the zeta potential, i.e. less than 10 mV. The slight 
increase in the P80, viscosity, elasticity and yield values at the highest pH values may possibly be 
due to metal hydroxide formation in the slurries , which could influence  all these factors as well as  
the zeta potential. It is also possible that the pumping and sonication during our measurement of  
particle size is breaking up weakly held agglomerates, even though these weak agglomerates  
could still be influencing rheological properties.
The sulfide content of the ore samples correlated with their zeta potential. Figure 31 shows the 
change in zeta potential at basic pH (pH 9 to 10) for the varied ore samples in low and high  
salinity process waters, as well as in 1 M sodium chloride. The overall trend is a shift towards  
more negative zeta potential values as the sulfur content of the ore increases. The trend towards  
more negative zeta potential values with increasing sulfur content appears to occur regardless of  
the salinity.
Figure 32 shows how the zeta potential changes as the percentage of magnesium and silicon  
containing gangue material in the ore increases. The zeta potential for all salinities shifts towards  
more positive values as the percentage of gangue material increases. From these and other zeta  
potential results obtained during the course of this project it seems that the sulfide surface is  
negative and relatively insensitive to increases in salinity while the gangue material, including  
metal oxides/hydroxides, is more sensitive to the salinity. This gangue material has a positive  
zeta potential at high salinities while an unoxidised sulfide surface would have a negative zeta  
potential. This means that the zeta potential, typically measured as the average of all surfaces  
present, can give an indication of the relative amounts of sulfide and gangue  in an ore sample.  
In general, the more positive the zeta potential, the more gangue is present in the ore and the  
less sulfide. These opposite charges on the gangue and sulfide surfaces are likely to cause a  
significant amount of heteroagglomeration between the gangue and sulfide particles.

3.9.1 Sulfides in Sodium Chloride
Flotation tests conducted on 10 weight percent pyrite (PYR-1) slurries in deionised water and 3 M  
sodium chloride are shown in Figure 33. The pH was initially adjusted to approximately pH 12 but  
this tended to decrease during the flotation. Bo th MIBC frother and a potassium amyl xanthate  
collector were dosed in at 100 g/t.
Regardless of whether a collector was used or not, a higher recovery of solids occurred when the  
solids were in the 3 M saline solution rather than water. Carrying out the flotation at high salinity  
gave a 4.6 fold increase in recovery with collector and a 3.2 fold increase with no collector. The  
high  salinity stabilised  smaller  bubbles  and in  general produced  more  froth.  These  factors  
contributed to the increase in recovered solids due to entrainment. From the water recovery  
percentages it was determined that the increase in recovery was not just due to increased  
entrainment. For example, the water recoveries from  the deionised water and 3 M sodium  
chloride samples were very similar, yet the recovered solids were slightly higher from the more  
saline sample.
The addition of the collector increased the recovery of solids in the 3 M sodium chloride solution  
more than it did in deionised water. In this case the water recoveries from the saline solution  
were much higher, so a substantial amount of this increase was probably due to entrainment. In

time (mins)%recovery (solids)the 3 M sodium chloride sample, the solid surfaces could more readily have a positive zeta  
potential which could increase the adsorption of the anionic collector. The high salinity may also  
have reduced the solubility of the xanthate, causing some of it to precipitate out onto the solid  
surfaces present. The increase in the water recovery along with the solids recovery for the high  
salinity solutions is consistent with the salt causing an increase in froth, which can happen if the  
frother solubility is decreased slightly. These results suggest that increasing the pH to depress  
pyrite flotation is not as effective at higher salinity.
Flotation tests similar to those above were conducted for chalcopyrite and pentlandite in both  
deionised water and 3 M sodium chloride. For these tests 100 g/t potassium amyl xanthate and  
25 g/t MIBC were used. The results under basic pH conditions are shown in Figures 34 and 35. 
For both chalcopyrite and pentlandite more solids were recovered in the froth flotation when  
using 3 M sodium chloride rather than when using deionised water. This increase in recovered  
solids is in part due to the slightly increased amount of froth produced in the 3 M sodium chloride  
and entrainment, but as for the pyrite case this cannot account for all of the increase in the  
recovered solids.

The flotation of the sponsors' ores were carried out on slurries with solid loadings of 20 weight  
percent with 25 g/t MIBC frother. The same collectors as those used in the sponsors' processes  
were used for the tests and included sodium ethyl xanthate, potassium amyl xanthate, sodium  
isobutyl xanthate and a modified thionocarbamate. The collector dosages used were similar to  
those used in the sponsors' processes and were in the 25 to 75 g/t range. For each test, the ore  
was dispersed in either deionised water, 1 M sodium chloride or the sponsors' process water.  
The effect of 50 g/t humate on the ores in 1 M sodium chloride and process water was also  
investigated. The metal sulfide recoveries and grades for the ores after a cumulative collection  
time of 8 minutes are shown in Figures 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 and 41.
The results suggest a general trend of reduced grade with increasing salinity, and therefore with  
more positive zeta potentials. As the salinity increa ses, the zeta potential is likely to pass through  
a point at which it is zer o, where the maximum particle agglomeration would be expected to  
occur. The small positive zeta potential of the ore in some of the saline backgrounds may not be  
high enough to fully re-disperse the particles. If the high salinity has caused agglomeration  
between sulfide and gangue particles, which is quite likely, then the grade would be reduced. The  
measured zeta potential for the ore samples is an average of the zeta potentials of all the  
particles present, so it is feasible that heteroagglomeration could occur between gangue and  
sulfide particles with opposite charges.  It is also possible that heteroagglomeration could occur  
between oxidised sulfide ores and unoxidised sulfide ores.

time (mins)%recovery (solids)The trend in recovery with increasing salinity was not as clear for the ore samples. In many cases  
the recoveries decreased as the salinity was increased but for some tests it increased. While the  
lower purity PENT-2 sample gave worse flotation results in the presence of 1 M sodium chloride,  
the higher purity PENT-3 sample produced better flotation grade and recovery in the presence of  
1 M sodium chloride. Similarly, the lower purity chalcopyrite CHALC-1 exhibited a poorer flotation  
separation with 1 M sodium chloride, while the higher purity CHALC-3 produced a good flotation  
yield and recovery with 1M sodium chloride. In some cases where an increased recovery was  
observed this could be attributed to a greater amount of froth forming for the more saline  
samples. Therefore this increased recovery could be partially due to entrainment. In general an  
increased salinity and overall positive zeta potential for the solids in the ore samples did not  
appear to increase the recovery.
The addition of humate decreased the grade and recovery in almost every single case. Humate  
is  a  surface  active  compound  which  readily adsorbs  onto particle  surfaces.  When  humate  
adsorbs onto a sulfide surface it will make the surface more hydrophilic, which will reduce both  
grade and recovery.

The zeta potential magnitudes for all the sulfide samples in this work were below 20 mV. Zeta  
potential magnitudes less than this are typically considered insufficient to keep the particles from  
agglomerating. However, the sizing measurements did not show any significant degree of fine  
particle agglomeration with only small increases occasionally observed at higher pH and high  
salinities. To have a significant impact on the flotation recoveries of these fine sulfides a four or  
five fold increase in the median particle size would be required.
The sulfide particles did not appear to agglomerate to any significant degree even when the zeta  
potential magnitude was decreased towards a value of zero. The samples during the sizing  
measurements are continuously circulated around the measurement chamber using a peristaltic  
pump. It is possible that the pumping of the samples breaks up any agglomerates and keeps the  
particles dispersed. If this is the case then the fine sulfide particles in the agglomerates are not  
tightly bound and can be easily broken up. This suggests that any agglomerates formed through  
modification of the zeta potential may be unlikely to withstand the conditions experienced during  
processing, in particular those in the flotation cells.
The rheology measurements showed subtle changes in the samples related to precipitation of  
metal hydroxide species and some zeta potential changes. The precipitation of metal hydroxides  
that would occur on increasing the pH increased the viscosities, elasticities and yields of the  
samples. These increases were not large but did give an indication that changes were occurring  
within the slurries and on the particle surfaces. The rheometer would often pick up changes  
before  any  changes  in  the  zeta  potential  were  detected.  Despite  the  small  rheological  
differences, the rheology of all the sulfide ore samples were generally similar. These similarities  
could be related to the similar particle sizes and overall zeta potentials of the samples.
The pyrite, chalcopyrite and pentlandite surfaces were all negative from approximately pH 4 up to  
pH 12. Chalcopyrite was the only sulfide to show a significant zeta potential shift with pH. The  
chalcopyrite zeta potential shifted to slightly more negative values as the pH was increased while  
the pyrite and pentlandite samples did not substantially differ across the whole pH range. Of the  
three sulfides the chalcopyrite would be unlikely to oxidise to the same degree as the pyrite and  
pentlandite samples. For mixtures of sulfides, this difference in oxidation behaviour could result  
in small amounts of iron oxide/hydroxide oxidation products on the chalcopyrite surface. Both  
pyrite and pentlandite are more prone to oxidation than chalcopyrite, and the oxidation results in  
iron oxidation products on the particle surface. The pyrite and pentlandite samples would both  
have higher amounts of ferric/ferrous ions present which would precipitate out as the hydroxide  
when the pH is increased. These hydroxides, as well as the greater amount of surface oxidation  
in the pyrite and pentlandite samples, are the most likely cause of the zeta potential not shifting to  
more negative values when the pH is increased. The chalcopyrite is not as prone to oxidation  
64and there would be less metal hydroxide formed at high pH, so the surface behaved more like a  
pristine unoxidised sulfide surface.
The effect of oxidation of the sulfides appears to be greater than the effect of metal hydroxide  
precipitation. Direct oxidation of the surface might be expected to lead to more oxidation products  
directly on the sulfide particle surface, where the oxidation products would have the largest effect  
on the zeta potential. On the other hand, the precipitation of metal hydroxide at high pH does not  
necessarily produce as much metal hydroxide localised on the sulfide surface. A significant  
proportion will precipitate out in the bulk solution and therefore it will not have as large an impact  
on the sulfide zeta potential and surface chemistry.
The surface of the sulfide particle is not likely to be homogeneous. There will be patches on the  
surface that are not oxidised and other patches that contain sulfide oxidation products such as  
iron oxides/hydroxides. Figure  42 attempts to illustrate the likely heterogeneous surface for a  
sulfide particle. The surface chemistry of the sulfide will be an average or combination of the  
various patches that make up the particle surface. For example if a surface is more heavily  
oxidised and has more oxide patches on it the surface will behave more like that particular oxide.  
The patches on different sulfide particles will also interact. These interactions are illustrated in  
Figure 42 by the dashed lines between the particles. The interactions between the patches, on  
the different sulfide particles, will affect the rheology and agglomeration characteristics. The  
greater the strength and number of these interactions the increased likelihood of agglomeration  
and an increased slurry yield, elasticity and viscosity. If these interactions are repulsive in nature  
65Figure  42: Idealised heterogeneous surfaces for metal sulfide particles. The dashed  
lines represent possible inter-particle interactions.
then agglomeration is less likely and the viscosity, yield and elasticity of the slurry will decrease.  
The zeta potential is one factor that would determine whether these interactions are of an  
attractive or repulsive nature.
During the course of this project it was found that the solid loading had a significant impact on the  
proportion of the sulfide surface that was oxidised. Sulfide slurries that had a lower solid loading  
exhibited zeta potentials which were typical of a greater degree of oxidation. The initial amount of  
oxygen  present  for  both  low and high  solid  loadings  would  be  the  same,  but  the  relative  
proportion of unoxidised sulfide surface to available oxygen increases with higher solid loadings.  
Therefore, to obtain results closer to those expected for an unoxidised sulfide surface, it was  
necessary to use a relatively high solid loading.     
As the salinity was increased, the sulfide zeta potentials shifted in some cases and remained  
relatively unchanged for others. These differences can be attributed to the degree of sulfide  
oxidation. For systems with sulfide surfaces which were predominantly unoxidised, the zeta  
potentials remained relatively unchanged as salinity was increased. For systems where a change  
in zeta potential occurred with increasing salinity, the sulfide surface was likely to be more  
oxidised. The zeta potential behaviour for these systems was similar to that expected for the  
sulfide oxidation products,  i.e. the zeta potentials were similar to that of the metal hydroxides.
The change in zeta potential behaviour of a sulfide surface with salinity was found to vary  
depending on the pH. At high pH the zeta potential for a sulfide surface shifted from a negative to  
a positive value with increasing salinity. This change in zeta potential is attributed to the oxidation  
and hydroxide products on the sulfide surface. Metal oxides and hydroxides have positive zeta  
potentials at high ionic strength. At lower pH less oxide and hydroxide would be expected on the  
sulfide  surface,  and  the  surface  behaved  more  like  an  unoxidised  sulfide  surface.  This  
predominantly unoxidised sulfide surface showed very little change as the salinity was increased.  
As well as the “cleaning” of hydroxides from the sulfide surface at lower pH there is another  
factor that could contribute to these differences. The smaller underlying negative charge for a  
surface at low pH would attract fewer cations to the sulfide surface. The accumulation of cations,  
like sodium, near a surface at high ionic strength can have an impact on the zeta potential [ 89].  
The  salinity could  not  be  used  to  agglomerate  the  fine  sulfides  to  the  extent  required  to  
significantly increase recovery by froth flotation. In some cases where an increase in recovery  
was obtained some of this was due to a greater degree of entrainment within the froth. In at least  
one case where a relatively pure sulfide sample in 3 M sodium chloride was tested a small  
increase in the recovery that was not simply due to entrainment was obtained. 
In highly saline solutions smaller bubbles are stabilised and normally more froth is produced. The  
amount of oxygen in the solution will also decrease as solubility of oxygen decreases as salinity  
increases. The smaller bubbles produced may help to float more of the finer material and a lower  
66amount of oxygen in the sample could reduce the amount of oxidation to the sulfide surface. Both  
these factors may be responsible for the small increase in recovery of sulfides in 3 M sodium  
chloride. Perhaps the most important factors, however, are the tendency of the potential on  
negative surfaces to be made positive when in the presence of high salt levels, and the high salt  
concentration causing the particle surfaces to act as if more hydrophobic.
The zeta potential of sulfide ores in process and saline waters did show a correlation with the  
froth flotation recoveries and grades (Figures 43 and 44). The overall trend was a shift to higher  
recoveries  and  grades  as  the  zeta  potential  shifted  to  more  negative  values,  which  also  
correlated with less oxidation. These trends were similar to the zeta potential trends with sulfur  
and gangue content (Figures 31 and 32). In these cases, the zeta potential reflected the changes  
in the ore rather than itself acting to increase or decrease the flotation recoveries and grades.  
The zeta potential shifted to less positive values for ores containing a higher sulfur and lower  
gangue content. Ores with less gangue material and more sulfide simply give better recoveries  
and grades, and the zeta potential was essentially acting as an indicator of the ore quality. The  
more negative the zeta potential, the higher the sulfur content and the lower the gangue content  
of the ore. 
Similarly, the zeta potential acted as an indicator for the degree of oxidation of the sulfide  
surface. The more positive the zeta potential the more oxidised the sulfide, and the less well it  
will be separated by flotation.
In Figure  44 there are two points that do not fit the general trend of a higher grade with an  
increasingly negative zeta potential. These points have a zeta potential in the vicinity of -8 mV  
and have a grade of approximately 10%. These points are from a pentlandite ore (PENT-2)

recovery (%)zeta potential (mV)which had the highest sulfur content of all the ores investigated. This ore contains a substantial  
amount of  non-pentlandite sulfides  such  as  pyrite and pyrrhotite. The  lower than expected  
pentlandite grade, for this zeta potential, was due to a substantial amount of non-pentlandite  
sulfides in the recovered solids. The shift in zeta potential to more negative values does not  
differentiate between the sulfides recovered from an ore into the concentrate. This zeta potential  
shift only acts as an indicator for the total recovered sulfides and gives no information on the  
sulfides that may be present in the concentrate.  
For the less pure or more oxidised ores, an increase in salinity decreased the grade and often  
the recovery. In most of these cases the zeta potential shifted towards more positive values. This  
shift to more positive values was probably due to the change in the zeta potential of the gangue  
material and the oxides on the sulfide surfaces. The zeta potential for the unoxidised sulfides  
remained a relatively unchanged negative  value  even at  high salinities.  Therefore  the zeta  
potentials for an unoxidised sulfide surface and gangue surface at high salinities have the  
opposite charge. This means that these particles could agglomerate under the right conditions  
and a slime coating of the gangue material on the sulfide surface is possible. This would be a  
contributing factor to the reduced recoveries and grades with increasing salinity. The other major  
factor which was mentioned previously was the initial gangue content of the ore. The more non-
sulfide gangue present, the more positive the zeta potential for the ore and the lower the grades.

Adjusting the salinity and pH did not cause the agglomeration of fine sulfide particles to a size  
where a significant improvement in recoveries and grades would occur. Significant increases in  
salinity reduced both recoveries and grades for most sulfide ores, although the increased salinity  
enhanced the flotation of at least two higher grade ores. 
In  saline  and  hypersaline  process  water,  gangue  particles  have  the  opposite  charge  to  
unoxidised sulfide particles, and the opposite charges subsequently cause an attraction between  
gangue and pure sulfide surfaces. Therefore, the decreased grades and recoveries in saline  
process  water  probably arise  from  increased  slime  coating  of  the  sulfide  surface.  This  is  
consistent with our results showing that flotation of the lower grade ores at high salinity produced  
the lowest recoveries and grades.
The zeta potential was a useful indicator of the overall ore quality. It provided a measure of the  
level of oxidation, sulfur and gangue content for an ore. Generally, the more negative the zeta  
potential the higher the sulfur content and the lower the gangue/oxidised sulfide content. The  
unoxidised sulfide and gangue/oxidised sulfide surfaces behaved very differently at high salinity.  
The unoxidised sulfide surface showed very little change with salinity while the gangue and  
oxidised sulfide surfaces were more sensitive to changes in salinity.
The pyrite, pentlandite and chalcopyrite zeta potentials  from pH 4 to pH 12 were all negative and  
less than 20 mV. The chalcopyrite was the only sulfide to shift to slightly more negative values as  
the pH was raised. This shift to a more negative surface is expected for unoxidised sulfides but  
did not occur for the pyrite and pentlandite samples due to their greater degree of oxidation and  
the hydroxide products on the surface.
The sulfide surface can become covered by metal oxide and hydroxide either through oxidation  
of the surface or precipitation/adsorption from the solution at high pH. If there is enough of the  
oxides/hydroxides on the sulfide surface it will behave more like a gangue particle than a sulfide  
particle, this will reduce recoveries and grades.
Multivalent metal cations only had a minor impact on the results, with most only having an effect  
at higher pH where metal hydroxide species form. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) had  
a significant impact on the zeta potential of the sulfide particles shifting them from negative to  
positive values.
Rheology measurements provided the most sensitive method of detecting changes within a  
slurry. Changes in rheology were sometimes observed even when there were no significant  
particle size or zeta potential differences. The yield, viscosity and elasticity all increased when  
metal hydroxides formed in the sample, and when the zeta potential was closest to zero.     
696. FURTHER WORK
Conditions where sulfide and gangue surfaces have an opposite charge are undesirable.  These 
conditions can produce sulfides with more of a slime coating which will reduce r ecoveries and 
grades. Using conditions, or adding species, that will result in sulfide and gangue surfaces having  
the same charge could reduce the slime coating on the sulfide. A reduced salinity will shift the  
surfaces to the same charge but this may not be a viable option. Another possible method would  
involve the addition of a surface active species that is able to either shift the gangue charge from  
positive to negative or the sulfide charge from negative to positive. CTAB is an example of one  
such surface active compound. Further work exploring the conditions and the possible species  
that can be used to maximise and maintain oppositely charged sulfide and gangue particles  
could help to improve recoveries and grades.
Metal oxides/hydroxides on the sulfide surface cause it to behave more like a gangue particle.  
The zeta potential measurement is an average value of all the surfaces present in a sample. This  
includes unoxidised and oxidised sulfide surfaces as well as metal hydroxide both in solution and  
on the sulfide surface. An idealised heterogeneous sulfide surface was used earlier in this report  
to explain some of the observations. An investigation of the nature and coverage of the oxidation  
and metal hydroxide products on the sponsors' sulfides would be of value. This would provide an  
opportunity to identify any potential methods for the removal and prevention of these coatings  
which lower recoveries and grades.
All the zeta potential values measured as part of this work had magnitudes less than 20 mV. Zeta  
potentials  in  this  range  are  not  usually  considered  large  enough  to  prevent  particle  
agglomeration, yet significant agglomeration of the fine sulfides did not occur. This was partly  
attributed  to  the  break  up  of  any agglomerates  formed  by the  pumping  of  the  slurry.  An  
investigation into strengthening of these fine particle agglomerates so that they were able to  
withstand the applied forces during pumping and agitation in a flotation cell would be worthwhile.  
If the fine particles do not agglomerate at these low zeta potentials then there must be other  
factors involved, such as a reduced attractive force or a non-electrostatic repulsion between the  
particles which also warrants further investigation.
The effectiveness  of  the collectors at high salinities was not investigated in this project. A  
decrease in collector performance as the salinity increases is possible and if this does occur  
recoveries and grades will decrease. An investigation into this possibility would help to determine  
whether the decrease in recoveries and grades at high salinities is related in any way to a  
decreased collector performance.
