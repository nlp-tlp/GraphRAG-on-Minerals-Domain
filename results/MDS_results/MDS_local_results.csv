Below is an \noverview of key findings, and a look at some of the common threads that link alteration patterns to fluid chemistry.  \nGold mineralising systems form through chemical reactions that destabilise gold in \nsolution, leading to the precipitation of gold. Large fluid volumes are considered  responsible \nfor the transportation and precipitation of gold. Models predict that flui ds move ppb levels of \ngold along structures and precipitate gold at key sites (i.e. structural jogs  and other \ndilatational features).  Models frequently show fluids derived  from the lower crust migrated to  \nthe upper crust along major structures with gold deposited along secondary str uctures. These \ncrustal fluid s are accepted to largely be H\n2O-CO2 rich fluids. However  as shown here and in \nearlier studies (M410 and M452) fluid pathways in Archean gold systems are not limited"",""2"":"" be rare. As such many of the discriminator mineral plots for the Wiluna Camp differ from those of their higher temperature counterpart. This study has demonstrated \nthe key mineral assemblages to map when looking for key chemical gradients in lower \ntemperature gold camps.

What is the average number of references in each MRIWA report?,"To determine the average number of references in each MRIWA report, we can analyze the data provided for the MRIWA reports. Here are the relevant reports along with their respective number of relationships, which can be interpreted as references:

1. **MRIWA REPORT NO. 476** - 9 references
2. **MRIWA REPORT M532** - 10 references
3. **MRIWA REPORT NO. 494** - 2 references
4. **MRIWA 452 FINAL REPORT** - 3 references
5. **MRIWA REPORT NO. 488** - 4 references
6. **MRIWA M0470 FINAL REPORT** - 6 references
7. **MRIWA 494 FINAL REPORT** - 3 references
8. **MRIWA PROJECT M0458 PROGRESS REPORT 5** - 1 reference
9. **MRIWA SOLUTION PURIFICATION AND BY-PRODUCT FORMATION REPORT** - 1 reference

Now, we can calculate the average number of references:

- Total number of references = 9 + 10 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 39
- Total number of reports = 9

**Average number of references per report** = Total references / Total reports = 39 / 9 ≈ 4.33

### Conclusion

The average number of references in each MRIWA report is approximately **4.33**. This indicates a moderate level of referencing across the reports, reflecting the collaborative nature of the research and the importance of citing various sources and relationships in the field of mineral research.",1,10681,"{""id"":{""0"":""10513"",""1"":""27234"",""2"":""8033"",""3"":""8510"",""4"":""1""},""entity"":{""0"":""\""MRIWA REPORT NO. 476\"""",""1"":""\""MRIWA REPORT M532\"""",""2"":""\""MRIWA REPORT NO. 494\"""",""3"":""\""MRIWA 452 FINAL REPORT\"""",""4"":""\""MRIWA\""""},""description"":{""0"":""\""MRIWA Report No. 476 is a comprehensive report detailing an integrated multi-scale study of crustal structure and prospectivity in the Eastern Yilgarn Craton and adjacent Albany-Fraser Orogen.\"""",""1"":""The \""MRIWA REPORT M532\"" is a comprehensive report that focuses on the geology, mineralogy, and geometallurgy of electric vehicle (EV) materials deposits located in Western Australia.
