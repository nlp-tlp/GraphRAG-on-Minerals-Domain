4. **Sequential Leaching Project M432 - Final Report to MRIWA** - 3 references [Data: Sources (8909, 8988, 5350)].

Now, let's calculate the average:

- Total number of reports: 4
- Total number of references: 4 (Report No. 488) + 3 (Report M532) + 6 (Project M451) + 3 (Project M432) = 16 references.

To find the average number of references per report, we divide the total number of references by the total number of reports:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total References}}{\text{Total Reports}} = \frac{16}{4} = 4
\]

### Conclusion

The average number of references in each MRIWA report is **4**. This indicates a moderate level of citation, reflecting the collaborative nature of the research and the importance of referencing in academic and technical reports.",ES,local_results
