What is the average number of references in each MRIWA report?,"To determine the average number of references in each MRIWA report, we can analyze the data provided for the MRIWA reports. Here are the relevant reports and their corresponding number of references:

1. **MRIWA REPORT NO. 476** - 10 references
2. **MRIWA REPORT M532** - 13 references
3. **MRIWA 452 FINAL REPORT** - 2 references
4. **MRIWA REPORT NO. 488** - 4 references
5. **MRIWA M0470 FINAL REPORT** - 2 references
6. **MRIWA 494 FINAL REPORT** - 1 reference

Now, we can calculate the average number of references:

- Total number of references = 10 + 13 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 32
- Total number of reports = 6

**Average number of references per report** = Total references / Total reports = 32 / 6 ≈ 5.33

### Conclusion

The average number of references in each MRIWA report is approximately **5.33**. This indicates that, on average, each report includes a moderate number of references, reflecting the collaborative and research-intensive nature of the projects undertaken by the Minerals Research Institute of Western Australia (MRIWA).",1,10724,"{""id"":{""0"":""9743"",""1"":""25080"",""2"":""7808"",""3"":""27228"",""4"":""7318""},""entity"":{""0"":""\""MRIWA REPORT NO. 476\"""",""1"":""\""MRIWA REPORT M532\"""",""2"":""\""MRIWA 452 FINAL REPORT\"""",""3"":""\""MRIWA REPORT NO. 488\"""",""4"":""\""PERTH WA 6000\""""},""description"":{""0"":""\""MRIWA Report No. 476 is a comprehensive report detailing an integrated multi-scale study of crustal structure and prospectivity in specific geological regions.\"""",""1"":""The \""MRIWA REPORT M532\"" is a comprehensive report that focuses on the geology, mineralogy, and geometallurgy of electric vehicle (EV) materials deposits located in Western Australia.

Key entities include various geological regions known for gold deposits, significant research projects, and notable researchers affiliated with UWA, all contributing to a rich network of geological exploration and education.\n\n## University of Western Australia as a research hub\n\nThe University of Western Australia (UWA) serves as a central entity in this community, recognized for its extensive research in geology, particularly in gold deposits. UWA is involved in various significant projects, including the MRIWA Project M476, which focuses on seismic data processing to enhance geological interpretation. This institution's research efforts contribute to a deeper understanding of mineral resources and geological processes, making it a pivotal player in the field of economic geology. UWA's collaborations with organizations like CSIRO further amplify its impact in advancing scientific knowledge in mineral resources [Data: Entities (1154, 10086); Relationships (10220, 10222, 10256)].\n\n## Significance of Gold Deposits in Western Australia\n\nGold deposits are a crucial aspect of the community, representing valuable mineral resources that are actively explored and mined in regions like the Yilgarn Craton and the Eastern Goldfields Province. These deposits are characterized by their unique geological settings and processes, particularly in Archean environments. The study of gold deposits not only has economic implications but also contributes to the understanding of geological history and mineralization processes. The presence of significant gold deposits in areas such as the Telfer District and Mt Pleasant highlights the importance of this community in the broader context of mineral exploration [Data: Entities (7905, 14636, 24926); Relationships (20410, 2383, 24534)].\n\n## Research contributions of notable scholars\n\nResearchers affiliated with UWA, such as Hodkiewicz, P. and John Walshe, have made significant contributions to the understanding of gold deposits and their formation processes. Their work focuses on critical aspects like sulfur isotopes and structural settings that influence gold mineralization. The academic output from these researchers, including Ph.D. dissertations, plays a vital role in advancing geological knowledge and fostering new insights into mineral exploration. This scholarly activity underscores the community's commitment to education and research in geology [Data: Entities (7142, 15100); Relationships (10235, 10218)].\n\n## Collaborative projects enhancing geological research\n\nThe community is characterized by collaborative projects that enhance geological research, such as the MRIWA Project M476, which involves partnerships between UWA and organizations like CSIRO. This project focuses on improving seismic data processing and understanding crustal structures, which are essential for mineral exploration.

These entities are primarily focused on gold mineralization and geological studies, contributing to the understanding of mineral systems in the Yilgarn Craton region.\n\n## Papa Bear Prospect's geological significance\n\nThe Papa Bear Prospect is a key geological site within the Kundana Camp, recognized for its substantial gold mineralization and ongoing geological research. This prospect is characterized by its unique geological features, including intermediate to felsic sedimentary units, and has been the focus of various studies aimed at understanding its mineral deposits. Notably, the prospect shows a correlation between gold concentrations and sulfur isotope values, which is crucial for assessing its potential for resource extraction. The ongoing research at this site includes alteration mapping and geochemical analyses, which are essential for understanding the geological formations present in the area [Data: Entities (7321); Relationships (21161, 21168, 21155, 21149, 21156, +more)].\n\n## Kundana Camp as a central hub for mineral exploration\n\nKundana Camp serves as a significant geographical and geological site for mineral prospecting, particularly related to gold systems. It hosts the Papa Bear Prospect and is associated with major mining companies like Northern Star Resources and Evolution Mining. The camp is characterized by distinct mineral zoning and is involved in various geological studies, including systematic scanning electron microscopy (SEM) mapping and core logging. These studies aim to enhance the understanding of mineral distribution and the characteristics of gold-related sulfides, which are critical for advancing knowledge in the field of geology and mineral exploration [Data: Entities (7351); Relationships (20325, 21390, 21399, 21409, 21402, +more)].\n\n## Pegasus Deposit's role in gold production\n\nThe Pegasus Deposit is a prominent geological site within the Kundana Camp, known for its substantial gold resources exceeding 1 million ounces. This deposit is characterized by specific alteration assemblages and mineralization processes that are critical for understanding the surrounding geological features. The deposit's geochemical characteristics, particularly its positive sulfur isotope values, indicate favorable conditions for gold deposition. The Pegasus Deposit is a focal point for lithogeochemistry studies, which are essential for assessing the mineralization processes in the region [Data: Entities (7363); Relationships (21635, 2112, 21201, 21640, 21629, +more)].\n\n## Collaboration with the Mineral Research Institute of Western Australia\n\nThe Mineral Research Institute of Western Australia (MRIWA) plays a crucial role in supporting research initiatives within the Kundana Gold Community. MRIWA provides financial assistance for various projects focused on gold mineralizing systems and their chemical reactions. This collaboration enhances the understanding of geological processes and contributes to the overall development of the mining sector in Western Australia. The institute's involvement in projects like M451 and M494 underscores its commitment to advancing mineral research and exploration in the region [Data: Entities (7350); Relationships (21394, 21393, 13794, 21367, 22220, +more)].\n\n## Interconnectedness of geological sites\n\nThe Kundana Gold Community is characterized by the interconnectedness of its geological sites, including the Papa Bear Prospect, Pegasus Deposit, and Carbine Area. These sites are part of the same geological framework and are involved in similar research initiatives aimed at understanding gold mineralization processes. The proximity of these sites allows for comprehensive geological studies that enhance the understanding of mineral systems in the Yilgarn Craton. This interconnectedness is vital for advancing knowledge in mineral exploration and resource extraction [Data: Entities (7320, 7352); Relationships (21147, 21398, 21419, 21404, 21422, +more)].""}}",{}
