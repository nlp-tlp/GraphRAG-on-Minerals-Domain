#### Industrial Applications

Nickel is a vital base metal utilized in various industrial applications, especially in alloys and batteries. The extraction efficiency of nickel is notably high, with a leaching percentage of 92.51% during processing, making it a valuable resource in metallurgy [Data: Reports (3252)]. The presence of nickel-bearing minerals, such as pentlandite and millerite, is crucial for understanding extraction processes and their environmental impacts [Data: Reports (3252)].

#### Environmental Considerations

Nickel's concentration is monitored in various environmental contexts, including soil, leachate, and water samples. Its presence in contaminated soils poses risks to environmental health, necessitating thorough assessments of its concentration levels [Data: Reports (3252)]. The chemical behavior of nickel is influenced by pH levels, with a noted association at pH 6.9, which is essential for optimal chemical interactions during extraction processes [Data: Reports (772)].
