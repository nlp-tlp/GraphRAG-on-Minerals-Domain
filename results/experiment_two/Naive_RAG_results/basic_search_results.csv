Identify any references to nickel or Ni in the MRIWA reports.,"## Overview of Nickel References in MRIWA Reports

The MRIWA reports contain several references to nickel (Ni) and its leaching characteristics, particularly in relation to environmental assessments and potential concerns regarding its concentrations in leachates.

### Leaching Characteristics

1. **Nickel Leaching Predictions**: The reports indicate that the LeachXS model predicted extremely low concentrations of nickel in leachates, specifically at L/S ratios of 1 or more, with values less than 0.0002 mg/L. This suggests that nickel is not considered a constituent of potential concern in the context of the IMG leachates [Data: Sources (4473, 4472, 5538, 5532, 4653)].

2. **Field Study Comparisons**: In the context of field studies, nickel concentrations were also reported to be low. For instance, the tall column trial and field trial data showed that nickel concentrations remained below detection limits in many instances, reinforcing the conclusion that nickel does not pose a significant environmental risk [Data: Sources (4473, 4653, 5538)].

### Summary of Findings

The findings across the reports consistently indicate that nickel concentrations in leachates are extremely low and do not present a significant environmental concern. The data from both laboratory and field trials support this conclusion, with nickel levels often falling below detection limits or remaining at negligible concentrations [Data: Sources (4473, 4472, 5538, 5532, 4653)].

In summary, the MRIWA reports provide a comprehensive overview of nickel's leaching characteristics, emphasizing its low concentrations and minimal risk in the studied contexts."," IMG Leachates.

These elements are analyzed in various contexts, including soil and groundwater studies, as well as in the assessment of by-products from mining and treatment processes. For instance, the reports detail the mean concentrations of these elements in different samples, such as fresh rock samples and treatment residues [Data: Sources (1500, 4388, 5320, 4795, 4812, +more)].

### Analysis and Context

The analysis of these elements is crucial for understanding their environmental impact, potential toxicity, and the effectiveness of remediation strategies. For example, the reports include detailed assessments of leaching characteristics and the behavior of these elements under various conditions, which is essential for environmental management and regulatory compliance [Data: Sources (1805, 4791, 4818, 5538, 2005, +more)].

In summary, the MRIWA reports provide a comprehensive overview of various elements, their concentrations, and their implications for environmental health and safety, particularly in the context of mining and land use."," MRIWA

EV MATERIALS DEPOSITS IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA
M Wells, M Aylmore and B McInnes 
Western Australia is the world’s largest producer of lithium (Li), mainly 
as spodumene concentrate. However, development of these uniquely complex deposits has only recently become economic due to rising demand for Li in batteries for electric vehicles. This MRIWA 
and industry-supported project has generated new petrology, 
mineralogy, geochemistry and geochronology data from 
some key Li–Cs–Ta (LCT) pegmatite deposits in Western Australia. Characterization and analysis techniques applied include XRD, SEM-EDS, EPMA, LIBS, LA-ICP-MS, SHRIMP U–Pb dating, 
40Ar/39Ar dating, FIB-SEM and 
ToF-SIMS. The mineralogy results are used to produce a comparative geometallurgical classification framework for Western Australian LCT pegmatites. Project samples were assessed using physical liberation, calcination and thermogravimetric methods. The project has built new capability and capacity in the, 029, China MINERAL RESOURCES

The purpose of this project is to gain a better understanding of the magmatic history of the East 
Kimberley, and to allow for a better evaluation of its prospectivity for magmatic Ni-C u-(PGE) as 
well as reef-style V-T i-Fe-PGE deposits. In order to do so, a multidisciplinary approach was taken, 
focusing on two of the major mineralised systems already known of in the area: the Speewah 
Dome and the Savannah magmatic systems. Thanks to the collaboration of researchers with a 
wide scientific expertise, this project combined results from: geochemistry, mineralogy, 
mineral chemistry, traditional geological mapping and logging, isotopic studies (S, O), 
geochronology, and magnetic (paleomagnetism and magnetic anisotropy) studies. The key 
results obtained are summarised below:

Executive summary "
Which regions of Western Australia are referenced in the MRIWA reports?,"### Regions Referenced in MRIWA Reports

The MRIWA reports reference several key geological regions in Western Australia, particularly focusing on the Yilgarn Craton and the Albany-Fraser Orogen. 

#### Yilgarn Craton
The Yilgarn Craton is highlighted as a significant geological area characterized by granite-greenstone terranes. This region has a complex Palaeo-Neoarchean tectonic history and is known for its mineral wealth, making it a focal point for geological studies and mineral exploration [Data: Sources (3396, 3397, 2912, 2913, +more)].

#### Albany-Fraser Orogen
Another critical area mentioned is the Albany-Fraser Orogen, which is discussed in the context of mineral systems on the margins of cratons. This region is noted for its geological significance and potential for mineral resources, particularly in relation to the adjacent Eucla basement [Data: Sources (2912, 2913, 3396, 3397, +more)].

### Conclusion
These regions are essential for understanding the geological framework and mineral prospectivity in Western Australia, as detailed in the MRIWA reports. The studies conducted in these areas aim to enhance knowledge of mineral systems and support exploration activities [Data: Sources (0, 2912, 3396, 3397, +more)]."," tre, Curtin University

Which MRIWA report author has been involved in more than one report/project?,"Based on the provided data, several authors have been involved in multiple MRIWA reports or projects. Notably, John L. Walshe is mentioned as an author in the MRIWA Project M494 report, which focuses on mapping the chemical architecture of gold camps [Data: Sources (2005)]. Additionally, he is also listed as an author in the MRIWA Project M476 report, which is an integrated multi-scale study of crustal structure and prospectivity of the Eastern Yilgarn Craton and adjacent Albany-Fraser Orogen [Data: Sources (3397)].

Moreover, Adam B. Bath is another author who appears in both the M494 report and the M476 report, indicating his involvement in multiple projects as well [Data: Sources (2005, 3397)].

In summary, both John L. Walshe and Adam B. Bath have contributed to more than one MRIWA report, showcasing their ongoing engagement in research projects under the MRIWA umbrella.","/11/2018 Revisions to Progress Report 5 to reflect feedback received at the

Progress on the project, and future project directions, were di scussed. MRIWA Project M0458 Progress Report 5 
Panton project           
Charmaine de Witt provided feedback on version 1 of Progress Report 5, and suggested that 
the report is revised to include the following:  
That only new data is presented in a revised progress report;
That the research publications produced during the reporting p eriod are included in a
revised Progress Report 5; and
That is it is noted that Mr Cleophace Mpinga was working on his PhD thesis during the
reporting period.
Progress Report 5 (this document) has subsequently been revised  to reflect that above request 
and has been re-issued as a version 2 report.

What is the average number of references in each MRIWA report?,"To determine the average number of references in each MRIWA report, we can analyze the provided data. The data includes several reports, each identified by a unique source_id. 

### Summary of Reports

From the data, we can see that there are multiple entries for various reports, particularly for the ""Sequential Leaching Project M432"" and ""By-products (LEAF) Project M451."" Here are some key observations:

- The ""Sequential Leaching Project M432"" has multiple entries (record ids 1805, 5320, 1379, 4775, 5538, etc.), indicating it is a significant report with numerous references.
- The ""By-products (LEAF) Project M451"" also has multiple entries (record ids 4791, 1597, 1617, etc.), suggesting it too is well-referenced.

### Calculation of Average References

To calculate the average number of references, we can count the total number of unique reports and the total number of references across these reports. However, the data does not provide explicit counts of references per report, making it challenging to derive an exact average.

Given the available data, we can summarize that:

- The reports vary in the number of references, with some having multiple entries and others fewer.
- A precise average cannot be calculated without specific counts of references per report.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, while we can identify that there are multiple reports with varying numbers of references, the data does not provide sufficient detail to calculate an exact average number of references per MRIWA report. Further detailed data on the number of references for each report would be necessary to perform this calculation accurately."," MRIWA

Leachate salinity was generally low, as indicated by mean EC values ranging from 120 to 6.8 mS/m 
(indicating brackish to fresh water quality), with monthly values being similar to those of the 
corresponding transition zone sample.  All major ions (Na, Ca, Mg, K and S) showed decreasing 
trends, indicating “wash -out” of solutes present in the supplied sample.   Leachates from the last 6 
months of the trial were close to rainwater quality.  
This sample was the only one to provide leachates with measurable concentrations of arsenic.  
Concentrations increased from 0.002 mg/L at week 0 to a maximum of 0.017 mg/L at month 18, with 
all concentrations being well below the livestock drinking water guideline and  freshwater aquatic 
guideline values of 0.5 and 0.024 mg/L (As III), respectively.  Several samples exceeded the lower 
aquatic freshwater trigger value of 0.013 mg/L for pentavalent arsenic (As V).  
Slightly elevated concentrations of molybdenum were presen t in leachates of this sample.  
Concentrations in leachates from column 1 ranged from 0.003 mg/L (month 1) to 0.047 mg/L (month 
9), although, LEAF) Project M451  -  Final Report to MRIWA

Executive summary "
Which MRIWA reports relate to mining extraction?,"## MRIWA Reports on Mining Extraction

Several reports from the Mineral Research Institute of Western Australia (MRIWA) focus on various aspects of mining extraction, particularly in relation to environmental impacts and mineral systems. Here are some key reports:

### 1. **MRIWA Report M532**
This report, titled ""The Geology, Mineralogy and Geometallurgy of EV Materials Deposits in Western Australia,"" discusses the production of lithium, primarily from spodumene concentrate, and the economic viability of these deposits due to rising demand for lithium in electric vehicle batteries. It includes new data on petrology, mineralogy, geochemistry, and geochronology from key lithium-cesium-tantalum (LCT) pegmatite deposits. The report also outlines various characterization and analysis techniques used in the study [Data: Sources (0, 921, 945, 920, +more)].

### 2. **Sequential Leaching Project M432**
This project report focuses on the Sequential Leaching Project, which aims to address knowledge gaps regarding the impact of mining on ground and surface water quality. It emphasizes the importance of environmental impact assessments (EIA) and mine waste management. The report discusses the need for well-designed waste rock dumps to minimize costs associated with rehabilitation and mine closure [Data: Sources (1805, 950, +more)].

### 3. **MRIWA Report No. 494**
Titled ""Mapping the Chemical Architecture of Gold Camps,"" this report presents findings from research conducted on the chemical gradients in Archean gold systems. It provides insights into the mapping of gold camps and the chemical architecture that influences mining extraction processes [Data: Sources (2005, +more)].

### Conclusion
These reports collectively contribute to understanding the complexities of mining extraction, particularly in Western Australia, by addressing geological, environmental, and economic factors. They highlight the ongoing research efforts to improve mining practices and mitigate environmental impacts associated with mining activities. For further details, the reports can be accessed through the MRIWA publications portal [Data: Sources (921, 920, +more)]."," tre, Curtin University

ChemCentre initiated a series of discussions with industry and WA regulatory authorities, in particular the 
Department of  Water and Environmental Regulation  (DWER, formerly: Department of Environment 
Regulation (DER), Office of Environmental Pr otection Authority (O EPA)  and Department of Water (DoW)) 
and the  Department of Mine s, Industry Regulation and Safety ( DMIRS) to identify knowledge gaps 
pertinent to the impact of mining, including iron ore mining, on ground and surface water quality. Such 
data is needed to inform (i) Environmental Impact Assessment s (EIA) , (ii) mine waste management and 
storage and (iii) mine -site closure planning. A well designed waste rock dump based on segregation and 
preferential placement of different waste types can o ffer substantial cost savings for rehabilitation and 
mine closure. On the other hand, miss -information can lead to double handling of problematic waste 
types and can become a costly exercise  for mine closure .  
From these discussions and related activities , the consensus view emerged,

THE GEOLOGY, MINERALOGY AND GEOMETALLURGY OF  
EV MATERIALS DEPOSITS IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA
M Wells, M Aylmore and B McInnes 
Western Australia is the world’s largest producer of lithium (Li), mainly 
as spodumene concentrate. However, development of these uniquely complex deposits has only recently become economic due to rising demand for Li in batteries for electric vehicles. This MRIWA 
and industry-supported project has generated new petrology, 
mineralogy, geochemistry and geochronology data from 
some key Li–Cs–Ta (LCT) pegmatite deposits in Western Australia. Characterization and analysis techniques applied include XRD, SEM-EDS, EPMA, LIBS, LA-ICP-MS, SHRIMP U–Pb dating, 
40Ar/39Ar dating, FIB-SEM and 
ToF-SIMS. The mineralogy results are used to produce a comparative geometallurgical classification framework for Western Australian LCT pegmatites. Project samples were assessed using physical liberation, calcination and thermogravimetric methods. The project has built new capability and capacity in the,  RESOURCE STRATEGY

Which MRIWA reports relate to mineral processing?,"## MRIWA Reports on Mineral Processing

Several reports from the Mining Research Institute of Western Australia (MRIWA) focus on mineral processing, particularly in relation to various mineral deposits and methodologies. Here are some key reports that are relevant to this field:

### 1. MRIWA Report M532
This report, titled ""The Geology, Mineralogy and Geometallurgy of EV Materials Deposits in Western Australia,"" discusses the mineralogy and geometallurgical classification of lithium, cesium, and tantalum pegmatite deposits. It includes detailed analyses using various characterization techniques such as XRD, SEM-EDS, and LA-ICP-MS, which are essential for understanding mineral processing in these contexts [Data: Sources (0, 921, 1, 945, 950)].

### 2. Sequential Leaching Project M432
The final report for the Sequential Leaching Project focuses on validating sequential leaching methodologies against different rock types, particularly iron ore deposits. This project aims to maximize the extraction of valuable metals and assess the leaching potential of various minerals, which is crucial for effective mineral processing [Data: Sources (945, 949, 950, 2005, 2006)].

### 3. MRIWA Report M494
Titled ""Mapping the Chemical Architecture of Gold Camps,"" this report presents research on the chemical gradients in Archean gold systems. It includes methodologies that can be applied to mineral processing, particularly in understanding the fluid pathways and alteration patterns linked to gold mineralization [Data: Sources (2005, 2006)].

### Conclusion
These reports highlight the ongoing research and development in mineral processing methodologies, particularly in the context of Western Australia's diverse mineral resources. The findings from these studies contribute significantly to the understanding and improvement of processing techniques in the mining industry.

THE GEOLOGY, MINERALOGY AND GEOMETALLURGY OF  
EV MATERIALS DEPOSITS IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA
M Wells, M Aylmore and B McInnes 
Western Australia is the world’s largest producer of lithium (Li), mainly 
as spodumene concentrate. However, development of these uniquely complex deposits has only recently become economic due to rising demand for Li in batteries for electric vehicles. This MRIWA 
and industry-supported project has generated new petrology, 
mineralogy, geochemistry and geochronology data from 
some key Li–Cs–Ta (LCT) pegmatite deposits in Western Australia. Characterization and analysis techniques applied include XRD, SEM-EDS, EPMA, LIBS, LA-ICP-MS, SHRIMP U–Pb dating, 
40Ar/39Ar dating, FIB-SEM and 
ToF-SIMS. The mineralogy results are used to produce a comparative geometallurgical classification framework for Western Australian LCT pegmatites. Project samples were assessed using physical liberation, calcination and thermogravimetric methods. The project has built new capability and capacity in the,  tre, Curtin University

The major objective of the project w as to validate sequential leaching methodologies against a range of 
rock types representative of iron ore deposits , focusing on those  that have low sulfur concentration and 
/or are of complex mineralogy . Step -wise sequential leaching methodologies are conducted to extract the 
maximum amount of informatio n from each representative sample  of each waste rock type . Typically, 
sequential leaching involves the successive application of increasingly aggressive solvents, with mass 
balance and reaction rate data being obtained for each leaching stage and respectiv e analytes (salts, 
metals and metalloids) of environmental concern.  
Although this project concentrates on applicability to the iron ore industry, sequential leaching 
methodologies may also be applicable as sample screening tools to assessing the leaching potential of 
metals including chromium, manganese, nickel and cobalt from ultramafic rocks associated with gold, 
nickel and other base metal deposits. The researchers would be very keen to explore this possibility at 
some stage, but for the purposes of the  current project there was a need to restrict the project scope in 
accordance with the industry sponsor’s requirements . Sequential Leaching Project  M432  –  Final Report to MRIWA
