  1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
MERIWA PROJECT M401: IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY 
David J. Robinson 
Efficient Solvent Extraction (SX) performance is cr ucial to an increasingly broad range of mineral 
processing operations.  The challenge is to understand how to increase throughput, reduce 
entrainment, optimise performance,  reduce costs and improve operati onal stability.  Reductions in 
capital and operating costs, and improved effici encies can be achieved in SX plants by: 
 Optimising the use of current equipment (usua lly mixer-settlers) through improvements in 
operation and design, 
 Where appropriate, introducing newer t echnology such as pulsed columns, and 
 Better management of reagents, especially with r espect to phase separation and organic degradation 
and loss. 
The AMIRA P706 multi-sponsor project ran betw een 2004 and 2006 and produced information 
relevant to mixer settler theory, design, modelli ng and application; organic system chemistry, 
degradation and phase separation; and pulsed co lumn technology, design theory, modelling and 
application. 
MERIWA project M401: Improving Solvent Extraction Technology Project (SXT) built on these 
foundations with support from eight mineral proces sing companies and equipment suppliers (Anglo 
American / Anglo American Platinum, Ausenco Ltd., Bateman Litwin NV, BHP Billiton, CESL / 
Teck, FMI / FMCG Inc., Minara Resources and St raits Resources), MERIWA and CSIRO Minerals 
Down Under National Research Flagship.  The focus of SXT was to translate the developments in 
fundamental understanding into outcomes for solven t extraction plant operations.  This involved a 
balance of fundamental and generic research as well as site focussed and more specific activities.  The 
project ran from 2007 to 2010 and involved approxim ately six monthly research forums and reviews 
and three campaigns of work on sponsors operations.   
Highlights of the research outcomes include;   Development of a variety of measures and probes for mixer settler characterisation including a 
robust and intrinsically safe flow measurement pr obe for use in both laboratory and pilot scale 
model SX systems and operating plants. 
 Improvement in two phase Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling capabilities for 
droplet formation, collisions and coalescence a nd the development of specific mixer and settler 
models of lab, pilot and full scale unit processes.  Mass transfer was included the CFD model of the mixer and validated.  
 Design, construction and initial use of an im proved Lewis Cell for fundamental kinetic and 
mechanistic studies, the incorporation of on-lin e analytical capabilities and the creation of the 
capability for fundamental and comparative testing of mass transfer and changes in mass transfer 
related to changes in the operating system and parameters. 
 On site investigations on the ope rations of three sponsors compani es.  This involved measuring and 
characterising flow patterns, identifying shortc omings of the operations , proposing opportunities 
for improvements and assisting production / technical st aff in their justification of changes to bring 
about these improvements.

  2 This report summarises the SXT project outcomes over the three year duration and specifically 
provides detailed information in a number of key areas including: 
 The selection and variety of solvent extraction equi pment currently available for consideration by 
potential users and where possible an indication of the relative advantages of each unit and where it 
could be considered useful; 
 A review of the critical mass transfer part of the solvent extraction process including a discussion 
of factors affecting the rate of mass transfer and some specific studies; 
 An introduction to the measurem ent of mass transfer, kinetics and tools used to study this 
important phenomena; 
 An introduction to the important topic of entrainment; 
 Details of some mass transfer and kinetic studies, focussed on the testing, validation and 
subsequent use of the CSIRO Lewis Cell to study the extraction of copper using a LIX984N / 
Shellsol D70 reagent system; 
 A more detailed study of the same copper extracti on process and the effect of variation of process 
parameters upon the kinetics and mechanism of mass transfer; 
 Mathematical (Computational Fluid Dynamic) modelling of inter-phase mass transfer in solvent 
extraction and inclusion of mass transfer in CFD modelling of unit operations; 
 Application of CFD modelling to the study of hydrodynamics in a bench scale model mixer unit. 
The progress and impact of the project was recognised  by the sponsors and as a result a proposal for 
an extension and broadening of the work has been put  together for an SXT2 project.  Initial plans for 
this project are also summarised in this report. 
 REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  3 1. INTRODUCTION 
Within the minerals processing industry and speci fically hydrometallurgical processing options, 
solvent extraction often plays a critical role achiev ing one or more functions such as value element 
separations, selective impurity removal, value me tal recovery, improvement in purity and often 
increase in concentration, solution preparation for final or intermediate or  metal production (e.g. by 
electrowinning, reduction or precipitation) etc.  Fo r various Australian and International companies 
solvent extraction is a critical technology in ma ny operations producing commodity metals such as 
copper, nickel, zinc, cobalt, uranium, rare earth el ements, gold and the platinum group elements.  New 
reagents and new combinations of reagents are c ontinually being developed and tested (including 
significant work in the CSIRO) for new applications. 
Predictions of metal processing and refining into the future suggest hydrometallurgy will be the 
increasingly favoured option particularly for lower gr ade, more complex ores and concentrates.  In 
addition many studies suggest hydrometallurgical  options are more sustainable, improving the 
industry’s energy, water, CO 2 and environmental footprint.  Lower concentration and increasingly 
complex leach solution could thus be anticipated to  be features of operations into the future, two 
factors which highlight the need for improved separ ation and purification technologies.  At the same 
time solvent extraction continues to be an integral  and critical unit for the separation and purification 
of metal solutions in many hydrometallurgical operations in Australia and internationally.  The 
efficient performance of solvent extraction operations is crucial to throughput, efficient metal recovery 
and purification, cost management and minimisation of values loss.   
Addressing fundamental understanding and operational improvements in solvent extraction is one way 
in which we can assist in placing solvent extraction at the forefront of solving current and future 
hydrometallurgical separation needs.  However, until this project the independent means of modelling (computationally and physically), diagnosing prob lems and improving the performance of the various 
contactors have been severely limited.  
The MERIWA “Improving Solvent Extraction Technology” project (M401) aimed to build on the 
physical and two- phase computational fluid dyna mics (CFD) models developed in the AMIRA P706 
project and pull together critical skills and capabilities developed independently across CSIRO 
Hydrometallurgical, Process Engineering and Math ematical Modelling groups.  Project aims included 
the development of improved CFD and physical models and their applicability, including the 
development of mathematical models of real pl ant units with the goal of  indicating improvement 
strategies for ongoing operations and assisting in the design of new plants.   
During the three years this project has enjoyed sponsorship and regular constructive input from 
representatives from Industry (Anglo American / A nglo American Platinum, Ausenco, Bateman 
Litwin, BHP Billiton, CESL / Teck, Freeport McMo Ran, Minara Resources and Straits Resources), 
the Minerals and Energy Research Institute of W estern Australia (MERIWA) and the CSIRO Minerals 
Down Under National Research Flagship.   REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  4 2. RESEARCH SUMMARY AND OVERVIEW OF OUTCOMES 
2.1 Background – AMIRA P706: Impr oving Solvent Extraction 
Technology 
Solvent extraction (SX) processes ha ve been used extensively to recover uranium, copper, nickel, 
cobalt, rare earths and other elem ents.  Although various SX pro cesses continue to be used for 
recovery of different metals in different plants, th ey all use similar equipment (mixer-settlers or more 
recently, pulsed columns), and face similar issues su ch as phase separation efficiency, crud formation, 
entrainment and organic degradation.   
The AMIRA project P706 was founded on the premise that  efficient SX performance is crucial to an 
increasingly broad range of mineral processing opera tions.  The challenge is to understand how to 
increase throughput, reduce entrainment, optimise pe rformance, reduce costs and improve operational 
stability – preferably all at the same time. 
Reductions in capital and operating costs, and improve d efficiencies can be achieved in SX plants by: 
 Optimising the use of current equipment (usua lly mixer-settlers) through improvements in 
operation and design, 
 Where appropriate, introducing newer t echnology such as pulsed columns, and 
 Better managing reagents, especially with respect to phase separation and organic degradation and 
loss. 
The initial two-year research project aimed at addressing such issues through developing a 
fundamental understanding of the parameters that  control the performance of SX equipment and 
reagents and the work program for P706 included: 
 Comprehensively reviewing mixer-settlers, pulsed columns and reagent degradation. 
 Examining reagent degradation in sponsors’ SX circuits. 
 Comparing the performances of mixer-settlers  and pulsed columns for Ni and Cu SX. 
 Establishing physical and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models to allow measurement, 
visualisation, prediction and verification of the impact of reactor design and operating conditions 
on droplet size distributions and fluid flow patterns. 
This was the first time that two-phase CFD mode ls (incorporating droplet break-up and coalescence 
models) for mixer-settlers and pulsed columns had b een developed.  These early models provided the 
tools to optimise droplet size distribution and fluid flow patterns – to conduct “what if” analysis on the 
impact of reactor design and operating conditions. 
Efficient SX performance is crucial to an increasi ngly broad range of mineral processing operations.  
While this could be considered a mature t echnology remaining challenges include improved 
understanding of how to increase throughput of exis ting plant (better use of established assets), reduce 
entrainment (and related operating costs), optimi se performance (for efficiency and selectivity), and 
improve operational stability.  The move from P706 to  SXT was based on the need to further develop 
capability and knowledge and similarly translate th ese advances into operati onal benefits for the 
sponsors particularly but also the industry in general.  
 REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  5 2.2 CSIRO SXT: Improving Solvent Extraction Technology - project 
structure and rationale 
At the centre of the motivation for the three-year  M401 (SXT) project was the aim to translate the 
fundamental understanding deve loped in P706 into outcomes for plant operations.   
The project combined the expertise and experience of  the Parker Centre solvent extraction chemistry 
and technology teams with those of CSIRO mathematical modelling (particularly the CFD group).  
The unique, state-of-the-art CFD models develope d in P706 for mixer-settlers and pulsed columns 
were to be utilised and refined to visualise a nd quantitatively describe the flows and performance in 
pilot plant and plant operations.  Potential solvent extraction reactor design modifications identified by 
sponsors and researchers to improve performance w ould be considered and evaluated using the CFD 
models, and, as appropriate, tested using the physi cal models and pilot scale facilities constructed for 
P706. 
The project was initially structured in four modules: 
 Incorporation of mass transfer into CFD m odels for pulsed columns and mixer-settlers.  
Incorporation of mass transfer into the CFD mode ls allowed the benefits of improved fluid flows 
and droplet size distributions to be translated in to models for improved plant performance in terms 
of productivity. 
 Design and operating improvements for SX reactors (pulsed columns and mixer-settlers).  The 
models developed in P706 were used to assess a lternative mixer-settler, pulsed column designs and 
operating conditions.  Some very pr eliminary work in this area w as performed in P706.  In the 
M401 (SXT) project, further operating and design improvements were considered based on both 
the preliminary results obtained from P706 and suggestions solicited from sponsors.  
 Translation of performance improvements (on single SX units) into gains in plant efficiency.  To 
gauge the impact of improvements in the operation of a single SX unit on the efficiency of a plant 
process, it is necessary to link unit models in series.  In the SXT Project, (CFD) models of single 
SX reactors were linked (in series) through process flowsheet models, to gauge the impact of reactor improvements on plant process efficiency. 
 Plant measurements of entrainment and fluid flows in settlers.  Very little plant information is 
available on fluid flows in settlers and the rela tionship to entrainment.  Modelling settler fluid 
flows and entrainment from laboratory and pilot plant experimental data is particularly difficult to 
scale up and apply to plant operations.  In or der to validate these models and approach a 
quantification of benefit of changes a probe used elsewhere in CSIRO research was adapted to be 
the “flow meter” of choice.  This was selected, m odified and adapted to measure both the flow rate 
and flow direction at various points (and depths) in plant settlers including the aqueous and organic 
phases.  This flow meter was then available for tr ansportation and installation at sponsors’ sites.  
Sponsors were asked to provide raffinate samples for entrainment analysis by the research team. 
The research strategy involves a combination of  laboratory and pilot scale work, modelling (both 
physical and CFD) and proof of concept case studies.   Sponsors’ meetings were held at 6-monthly 
intervals and all reports, presenta tions and papers were posted on an SXT web site accessible by 
sponsors. REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  6 2.3 Project highlights and outcomes  
As the project developed, capabilities grew and the project evolved in four main areas.  These 
following areas will be used to describe at a high level the findings and impact of the project: 
 Fundamental science and entrainment; 
 Computational fluid dynamic m odelling of mixers and settlers; 
 Physical modelling and development of characterisation probes; 
 Site based measurements, diagnosis of pr oblems and identification of opportunities. 
2.3.2 Fundamental science and entrainment 
Under this work program, three key areas of research have been carried out:  
 Mass transfer and kinetic measurements for incorp oration into the computational fluid dynamics 
(CFD) modelling package;  
 Solvent extraction entrainment fundamentals for iden tification of entrainment factors, effects and 
issues in entrainment sampling and measurements;  
 Testing and review of new solvent extraction equi pment carried out to gain a better knowledge of 
new equipment developments. 
The major outcomes from the work are outlined as follows: 
 A comprehensive review of solvent extraction prin ciples and various techniques for mass transfer 
and kinetic measurements provi ding a better understanding of the solvent extraction kinetic 
fundamentals and techniques for further development; 
 A CSIRO Lewis cell with improved features was de veloped and validated, offering a useful tool 
for kinetic measurements for various solvent extraction systems with minimum ambiguity; 
 Establishment of the rate equation and kinetic m echanism for copper extraction systems and testing 
using a batch mixer for incorporation into the initial CFD model; 
 Comprehensive review of entrainment in solven t extraction, focussing on entrainment factors, 
effects, methods for sampling and entrainment m easurements, with major entrainment streams and 
issues in sampling and entrainment measurements identified for further research and development; 
 A comprehensive review of new solvent extracti on equipment and work on the modification of the 
pulsed column at CSIRO Waterford with Teflon inte rnals for demonstration at sponsors’ meetings. 
Specifically from the review of new equipment it is of  interest to note that over the last two to three 
decades, traditional mixer settlers have been improved by:  
 Placing the settler feed launder on the top of the settle r (the Krebs mixer settler) or at the side of the 
settler (the Bateman settler) to enhance phase separa tion and to shorten the distance of the settler 
discharge points to the next stage mixer; 
 Designing better mixer arrangement and better s tirrers to avoid over mixing and increase 
transportation capability (the VSF mixer settler); 
 Designing a better feed distribution system to impr ove flow patterns in the settler (the VSF mixer 
settler and the Lightnin mixer-settler); 
 Placing picket fences or coalescence media in the settler to form a deep emulsion section to combat 
macro eddies and micro droplets. REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  7 Within the minerals industry, limited new equipmen t has been introduced and adapted, such as a 
pulsed column (the Bateman pulsed column) and few completely new ideas have  been developed (e.g. 
the Kenics and Lightnin in-line mixer and The Koch -Glisch in-line mixer settler).  All new equipment 
aims to obtain better and controllable mixing and settli ng, so that high solvent extraction efficiencies 
can be obtained, the need for expensive reagen ts reduced, and capital and operation costs saved. 
Similarly SXT researchers reviewed information fro m reagent manufacturers, mining companies, and 
the open literature on types and mechanisms of entr ainment and techniques used for the entrainment 
measurements.  Both aqueous and or ganic entrainments are practical issues in all SX operations, and 
have potential to cause disastrous effects on downstream or upstream operations.  Although 
entrainment control in SX operations is important in terms of both efficiency and steady operation, 
many SX plants have not been sufficiently successful at  least partially because of the lack of means of 
accurate and precise analysis of entrainment. 
Centrifugation and the Karl Fischer methods ar e commonly used techniques for measuring aqueous 
entrainment in organic phases.  Several methods have  been established and practiced commercially for 
measurement of organic entrainment in the aqueous phase.  These include centrifugation, total organic 
carbon (TOC), extraction and gravimetry, EmporeTM filtration, extraction and infrared spectroscopy 
(Horiba analyser), GC and HPLC analysing,  extraction and maximum metal loading.  
Each method has its own advantages and disadvantag es.  The suitability of each method depends on 
the requirement and operation cond itions of individual SX circu its, including the level of the 
entrainment to be measured, the organic system used  and the availability of measurement equipment.  
“Best practice” was summarised and discussed with ope rating sponsors, and an aim of future research 
is to achieve reliable and sufficiently accurate on-line analysis of both organic entrainment in aqueous 
and aqueous entrainment in organic. 
A literature survey and early model details have been presented previously.  This work formally fits 
into module 1 and the presentation was centred on the establishment of capabilities in fundamental 
kinetic measurements for systems of choice with the aim of deriving para meters appropriate for 
inclusion in the mass transfer components of th e CFD model and thus improving the accuracy of the 
metal extraction component of the mixing model. 
A major achievement in this module of work was the successful design, construction, commissioning 
and initial testing of a Lewis Cell for the purpose of  determining fundamental kinetic parameters and 
phase transfer mechanisms associated  with the industry standard so lvent extraction of copper.  In-
house HPLC expertise has been used to develo p an “in-situ” measurement system to make 
“continuous” measurements and thus en abling measurement of rapid processes.

REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  8 The copper system under study in this work include d study of the extraction mechanism under varying 
conditions and the Lewis system allowed for consider able variation of many parameters including the 
following: 
 Temperatures – in particular measurements at relatively low and high temperatures to mimic the 
operational variation of this parameter; 
 Copper concentrations and concen trations of other metals and species in the aqueous phase; 
 Acid levels (pH), redox potentia l and other aqueous conditions; 
 LIX984N concentrations and variation of any part of the organic formulation. 
Further improvements including alternative horiz ontal baffles have now been designed and 
constructed to allow the study of the effect of  differing surface areas and a second generation Lewis 
Cell is envisaged to allow the more convenient dete rmination of kinetic parameters for much slower 
and some faster processes.  This capability is now available for both fundamental and comparative 
studies and could find great application in charac terising aging and impurity effects, diluent and 
accelerator effects, the effects of impurity build-up or loss of organic capacity and characterisation of new reagents. 
2.3.3 Computational fluid dynamic mode lling of mixers and settlers 
Building on the CFD models previously established, the mathematical modelling researchers have 
focussed on improved programming and the applicati on of CFD modelling to i) predict mixing and 
flow patterns in real laboratory and full scale settle rs and ii) consider changes in the mixer, settler 
design and operation as well as the effect of such changes upon mixing and flow patterns. 
With respect to the fundamental improvement s in the CFD model, changes and significant 
improvement have been made in the following areas: 
 Improved droplet formation model for mixer mode lling (with the ability to tailor the model to 
varying organic and aqueous systems); 
 Improved droplet collision and coalescence model for settler modelling (with the ability to tailor 
the model to varying organic and aqueous systems); 
 Incorporation of mass transfer into CFD models  for mixer settlers and to a lesser extent pulsed 
columns.  This latter improvement in the model was based on a comprehensive literature review of 
mass transfer in SX that considered fundamenta ls, experimental measurements and previous work 
on modelling mass transfer.  A mass transfer sub- model for a copper system was built into a two-
phase CFD model of the laboratory mixer and expe rimental measurements used to validate the 
predicted results.  Subsequent va lidation in the pilot scale was also undertaken and a range of 
physical and operating conditions have been studied; 
 Flow patterns and detailed analysis around criti cal items such as impellors, baffles, chevrons, 
fences etc.  In particular the flow patterns around and through settler fu rniture were validated 
initially at the laboratory and pilot scale using th e FBRM probe described below and later were 
validate at the full operational scale by measurements in operations (see below). 
  REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  9 With the improved modelling capability its applica tion to interrogate potential improvements in 
mixers and settlers was exploited.  A range of potential changes already considered, modelled and 
assessed in this project include: 
 Running simulations with R320 at different clearances; 
 Modelling and assessing the effect of: 
o Upward and downward pumpi ng auxiliary A310 impeller; 
o Shortened baffles; 
o Centrally positioned R320 with draft tube; 
o Axial flow-pump impeller. 
 
Much of this modelling was run in parallel with the physical modelling work (described below) and 
thus comparisons of modelled a nd observed behaviour were readily  made.  The general approach 
involved separating the functions of the impellor wh ich include pumping action, droplet formation and 
intimate mixing, and considering designs or modifi cations for each function independently; thus novel 
selections and arrangements of impellors continue to  be considered.  However, generally the research 
is limited to considering the use of components that  are considered readily available or relatively 
simple modifications.

2.3.4 Physical modelling and development of characterisation probes 
Work in this area was targeted at the deve lopment and testing of both design and operating 
improvements for solvent extraction reactors (mixer  settlers and pulsed colu mns) and involved the 
development of laboratory and pilot testing capabilit y, the investigation and improvement in a number 
of diagnostic tools, and the support an d involvement in site based activities. 
Early in the SXT program a forum of sponsors was convened to brainstorm and discuss many 
potential modifications and a limited number of design modifications were prioritised for 
investigation.  In the mixer this included the use of  various baffles, the addition of an auxiliary mixer, 
variation in the pump-mixer clearance and a new pump-mixer design.  Similarly in the settler, 
prioritised changes included variation of the size, nu mber and spacing of picket fences, and the design 
of a feed launder and use of distribution vanes at th e entrance to the settler, false bottoms, recycles and 
outlet arrangements.  These selected design changes we re incorporated into the physical mixer-settler 
model and physical measurements were made to eval uate the beneficial and detrimental consequences 
of each change.  
REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  10 A combination of physical modelling and measureme nt and CFD modelling was used to evaluate and 
validate these proposals and all findings were discuss ed with sponsors.  Limited work was done on the 
pulsed column due to the focus of attention of th e sponsors but with some interest from current and 
potential sponsors of further related research (e .g. Vale and Goro, BHP Billiton and Olympic Dam and 
Minara and Murrin Murrin) the need to consider ch anges in pulsed columns and improvements in their 
design may be re-evaluated.  
 
Figure 3. Typical images of laboratory scale physical modelling capabilities being used to investigate potential 
changes in the engineering and design of the internals of a mixer box, a pulsed column and a settler (left to right). 
Of particular interest is the development of a correlation between torque measurement on the 
impellor / mixer and droplet size distributions.  A new torque meter was used on the mixer and the 
value of the combination of measurements of both torque and pressure drop against the various 
impellor options has been evaluated.  Also of partic ular interest at the moment is the measurement of 
droplet sizes, mean size(s) and size distributions with  the various mixer configurations.  Initial work 
involved: 
 Single–phase measurements of mixer torque and pr essure drop inside the bottom chamber with and 
without auxiliary mixer A310 (both up- and down-pumping); 
 Two-phase organic droplet size measurements inside  the baffled mixer with and without auxiliary 
mixer A310 using Lasentec’s PVM probe. 
Similarly from an operational perspective the assessm ent of effect of picket number, spacing and 
position on the dispersion band is important to entr ainment minimisation or management.  This work 
led to some suggestions of improved picket fe nce design and optimal positions for selected unit 
operations (i.e. selected equipment, applications a nd operational conditions) but the generality of these 
“optima” is still to be confirmed with differing operating conditions (phase compositions, ratios, flow 
rates etc.).  An approach was developed to di gitising the images and quantifying the size of the 
dispersion band in different arrangements, gi ving a relative number for comparative use. 
Numerous probes were tested and evaluated for flow  pattern measurement and an Ultrasonic Velocity 
Profile (UVP) system has been de veloped and prov en on laboratory, pilot and full scale settlers as 
being robust and appropriate fo r measurement of velocities. 
The use of conductivity probes and other measurem ent devices for the location and mapping of the 
interface and dispersion band was progressed and can now be incorporated into real site surveys.  In 
particular the effect of settler furniture upon di spersion band depth and position is likely to be 
revealing. 
2.3.5 Site based measurements, diagnosis of prob lems and identification of opportunities 
Whilst the aims of SXT included transferring new knowledge to operational solvent extraction plants 
and the delivery of real benefits to sponsors, it was with some relief that operating sponsors invited 
our team of researchers onto their operations with great enthusiasm.  In the middle of the second year 
of this project our first opportunity arose with BH P Billiton and in particular opportunities with two of 
REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  11 their Chilean copper operations.  Before the end of this project similar opportunities arose with 
Freeport McMoRan and their Morenci operation in Arizona and with Minara and their Western 
Australian Murrin Murrin operation.  Whilst each ope ration disclosed confidential information to 
enable the team to work on site and both measure and model flow patterns, for obvious reasons all of 
these details were not available to be shared with  the other sponsors.  The following three sections 
summarise the activities and findings of the th ree specific site focussed activities. 
2.3.5.1 SXT activities focussed on the BHP Bil liton Spence and Escondida copper operations in 
the Antofagasta region of Chile 
During the last week of February and first we ek of March 2009, William Yang and Kosta Simic from 
CSIRO) travelled with Mauricio Chovar and Rueben Rajasingam (BHP  Billiton) to Northern Chile 
and spent several days each at the Spence and Escondida operations of BHP Billiton Chile.  The 
purpose of this exercise was to gather the first real  measurements and other evidence of the true flow 
patterns in selected settlers at each of these operations  and make comparisons of this data with the 
patterns presented by the CFD model.  In addition to  working with the UVP probes, videos were taken 
at a number of locations looking at surface flows in each settler and these videos were presented. 
A significant attempt was made prior to these meas urements to customise the CSIRO CFD model to 
represent the engineering parameters of the selecte d settlers and give some prediction of the flow 
patterns; however, this was incomplete due to the co mplexity in gaining full engineering data and the 
time required to complete the model itself. 
The team gathered visual evidence and velocity m easurements with the UVP probe that demonstrated 
unexpected flow patterns.  Not surprisingly during this first test of the equipment on site a few 
logistical / site issues arose and these delayed the measurements to some degree; however, all things 
considered the sponsors agreed the trials had b een very successful and had given each of the sites 
plenty to think about.  
A number of interesting observations with both the site work and the modelling work were made and 
the following areas of discussion are worthy of mention: 
 Strong recirculation currents upstream of the chevrons caused by high kinetic energies of inflows; 
 Backflows at the surface and in the side launder ; 
 Complex flow patterns between the chevron and th e picket fence including recirculating flows, 
upwelling and phase re-mixing; 
 The role of the Outotec DDG (Dispersion Depl eter Gates) and the possible introduction of 
substantial vertical velocity particularly into  the dispersion band and the consequences of this; 
 Issues around measurements in or through a disp ersion band and the interference caused by 
droplets and solids on the UVP measurement in  the settler were reported and discussed; 
 The consideration of settling profiles for use in th e CFD model rather than just the final settling 
time and operational observations that the dispersion settles (or separates) slowly initially and more 
rapidly later on; 
 There were considerable regions  of high horizontal velocities (s ometimes up to 4 times those 
expected from flow rates) in both phases and as a c onsequence the need for regions of slow flow or 
even back flow; 
 The significant and poorly predicted impact of solid s build-up either at the bottom of the settlers or 
at the two-phase interface. REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  12 Opportunities for testing of improvements in settler furniture were identified (some of which would 
need to be done with the suppliers) with on-site  opportunities to readily improve flow patterns and 
likely improve SX performance. 
 
2.3.5.2 SXT activities focussed on the F reeport McMoRan Morenci copper operations in 
Arizona, USA 
Following the successful demonstration of capab ility and interesting observations at BHP Billiton 
Chilean operations, Freeport McMoRan requested sim ilar work on several settlers at their Morenci, 
Arizona copper operation.  Measurements were made of aqueous and organic velocity in the Stargo 
EP Metcalf E2A and Metcalf E2B settlers.  There was limited scope to observe the flow on the surface 
of the organic because of restrict ed access to the nominated settlers and as a consequence, partial 
observations have been made only of the Stargo settle r.  The major component of this study involved 
obtaining the 2D flow structures in a horizontal slice in each of the organic and aqueous phases using 
the Ultrasonic Velocity Profiling (UVP) system.  On this second site a study on the measurements showed a greater level of detail than previously achieved.  Moreover it was possible to compare the 
flow structures that resulted from different settler internals.  Other observations included local flow 
unsteadiness and backflow.  Entrainment measurements  were also conducted at the same time as the 
velocity measurements for the purpo ses of comparing settler performance.  
In summary the settler flows were found to be far from the desired plug flow indicating that 
coalescence may not be optimal and suggesting there was scope for significant improvement, particularly at the inlet / chevron end.  The major findings of the full-scale site investigations were: 
 Existing large gaps between fence panels allow relatively high velocity streaming which leads to 
non-ideal flow structures and reduces the efficiency of coalescence; 
 The Stargo EP chevron fence design produces a non-uniform flow through the fence and 
consequently less than uniform flows in  the region downstream of the chevron; 
 Backflow was found in areas downstream of the chevron fence in both the Metcalf E2A and E2B 
settlers.  In the case of E2A, the backflow ex tended over almost the entire region between the 
chevron and the first picket fence (similar backflow  has also been seen previously in one of the 
BHP Billiton settlers); 
 The flow downstream of the DDG in the Metcalf E2A settler is quite uniform in both the aqueous 
and the organic, and in both cases, the velocity is close to the expected bulk linear velocity for the 
phase; 
 The flow velocity of organic exiting the coalescing packs in the Metcalf E2B settler is substantially 
higher (an average of 90 mm/s) than the expected bulk linear velocity (58 mm/s), with the velocity 
in some regions as high as 140 mm/s; 
 On the other hand, the flow velocity of aqueous  exiting the coalescing packs in the Metcalf E2B 
settler is substantially lower (an average of 24 mm/s) than the expected bulk linear velocity 
(55 mm/s).  This could be a result of aque ous by-passing the coalescing packs through a gap 
between the packs and the floor of the settler; 
 The internals of a settler have an impact on th e efficiency of coalescence as indicated by a 
difference in organic entrainment in the aqueous phase between the Metcalf units.  Lower levels of 
organic entrainment are achieved with coal escing packs (E2B) over a DDG/picket fence 
arrangement (E2A). 
  REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  13 The results of the full-scale settler studies led to a number of recommendations (many of which could 
be and were acted upon) including the following: 
 Gaps between fence panels be blocked, or panels mo ved to eliminate the gaps; 
 The Stargo EP chevron be re-designed with non-uniform  picket widths or picket spacing in order to 
produce a more uniform outflow across the fence.  CFD modelling could be utilised to determine a 
design that would optimise flow uniformity; 
 CFD modelling be carried out for the Metcalf se ttlers to confirm the cause of the backflow 
downstream of the chevron, and to seek desi gn changes that may remove the backflow; 
 CFD modelling be carried out for the Metcalf E2 B settler to understand the cause of the high 
organic velocity and low aqueous  velocity downstream of the coalescing packs, and to explore 
design changes that may produce more uniform flow. 
Further, UVP measurements were recommended to provide a more complete characterisation of the 
flow structure following any significant design change.  In parallel with the entrainment determination 
improvements could be quantified.

2.3.5.3 SXT activities focussed on the Minara, Murrin Murrin nickel operations in Western 
Australia 
Site work at Minara’s Murrin Murrin operation involved the use of the UVP probe in detailed 
mapping of the velocities of both aqueous and organi c phases in selected settlers.  The regions of non-
ideal flow were characterised in four separat e settlers; varying intern al configurations and 
opportunities to improve these were identified.  With site experts and engineer ing staff, proposals to 
improve the flow patterns and consequent pe rformance of these units have been explored. 
In this campaign of work the UVP probes were also tested and proved able to be used for dispersion 
band identification and mapping.  This was the first real picture operators had of the variation in 
dispersion band (position, depth etc.) within otherw ise very dark / opaque systems and proved very 
useful.  
In-parallel CFD modelling of selected units demonstr ated the value of the independent computational 
modelling and when constructed with precise operati onal and engineering data, its ability to predict 
flow patterns.

  14 2.4 Specific research topic outcomes and findings 
In addition to the above overview  of research directions and out comes the following sections attempt 
to capture developments and findings in the major areas of this research covered within the scope of 
the SXT project.  Section 3 covers a literature review of the equipm ent used in the application of 
solvent extraction technology particularly within mi nerals processing / hydrometallurgy industry.  The 
focus in this section is on mixer settlers and the largely incremental modifications to the simple, 
original design as applied over the 40 or so years.   More recent developments of improved mixers, 
improved fence designs and coalescence media as well as alternate more exotic contactors, such as 
columns and centrifugal units, are discussed briefly. 
Section 4 covers the findings of a second literature  survey specifically focussed on the process of mass 
transfer in metallurgical solvent extraction; with in this section we discuss the important chemistry 
involved in the various mechanisms, the mathematic s and mathematical models of these processes.  
The topics of mass transfer and kinetic measuremen ts, entrainment and new equipment developments 
are introduced in Section 5 and similarly the significant topic of entrainment is covered in Section 6. 
Section 7 describes the development of a capability within CSIRO for accurate determination of the 
rates of extraction of metals under highly contro lled conditions.  The CSIRO Lewis cell builds on the 
original Lewis Cell and subsequent incremental impr ovements, to provide an unique opportunity for 
fundamental and comparative studi es of mass transfer rates under a variety of operating conditions1.  
The emphasis of the project sponsors led to the initial study involving the copper / LIX984N system 
although the capability is equally appropriate for studying almost any solvent extraction system 
metallurgical or otherwise. 
Sections 8 and 9 respectively, focus on the use of mathematical modelling (in particular computational 
fluid dynamic – CFD – modelling) on mass transfer  in real solvent extraction mixers and the 
hydrodynamics of solvent extraction mixers.  CF D modelling has proven to be a robust modelling 
technique for the modelling of many fluid and slurry flow, mixing and separation processes and 
similarly has proven to be a reliable method for depi cting and predicting mass transfer and fluid flow 
patterns in mixers, settlers and columns.  The co mbination of these outcomes, the newly established 
competence and capability has led to a push from sponsors to continue the work in a new extension to 
this project – Improving Solvent Extraction Technolog y 2 (SXT2) which is introduced in Section 10.

kinetics and extraction isotherms for their own reag ents and reagent systems, however this is less 
quantitative and  less comprehensive  than the in formation available from the CSIRO system and 
could be considered less than “independent”  REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPR OVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  15 3. A REVIEW ON NEW SOLVEN T EXTRACTION EQUIPMENT 
Without doubt the mixer-settler is the most widely  and frequently selected equipment (of the various 
solvent extraction equipments available) in the mining  industry.  This can simply be ascribed to design 
simplicity, simplicity of scale-up, ease of operation,  reliability, flexibility,  high efficiency and 
probably their underlying familiarity.  Some of th eir drawbacks include the often large footprint, 
relatively complex piping system, challenges w ith mass transfer and phase separation and large 
organic inventory (Ritcey, 2006).  
Over the years, many aspect of the design and ope ration of mixer-settlers have been modified and 
improved to overcome their drawbacks.  The followi ng sections will highlight some of the advantages 
of each of the alternate mixer-settler options w ith changes being made in both the settler (phase 
separation section) and the mixers (mass transfer se ction), briefly talk about some of the alternative 
equipments considered including columns and centrif ugal contactors and direct the reader to further 
sources of information. 
3.1 Mixer-settlers 
3.1.1 The Krebs mixer settler 
The Krebs mixer-settler is a reverse-flow mixer se ttler, which has the following operating advantages 
(Hopkins 1996): 
 Proximity of the mixer boxes and the settler weirs improves operator access and control. 
 Overall settling rate is improved by the use of the feed launder. 
 Feeding of the almost settled phases behind pick et fences ensures good residence time for 
secondary haze coalescence. 
The Krebs mixer settler (Figure 5) was designed to  improve performance rates and to overcome the 
challenge of large flows.  It consists of three main components: a conical pump mixer, a launder, and 
settler (Kohler et al . 1985 and Anon. 1989, Sonntag et al . 1992).  The mixer has three main 
components:  the mix box, the rotor assembly consis ting of a mixing impeller, a conical pump rotor 
and a drive mechanism, and the conical pump stator.  Two mixers in series are used when high flow 
rates and high residence times are required.  One of the features of the Krebs mixer settler is that the 
mixer and the settler are connected by a launder, which is located above the settler and where the 
phase separation initiates.  While the solution mixtur e flows away from the mixer in the launder, it 
flows towards the mixer in the settler.  By this  arrangement, the piping between the stages is 
shortened.  It was claimed that the performance rates were 2-4 times greater than the conventional 
mixer settler.  Large throughput Krebs mixer settlers up to 2700 m3/hr have been installed worldwide 
since 1989.  
 
Figure 5: A schematic diagram of the Krebs mixer-settler (Sonntag et al.  1992). 
  
REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  16 The Krebs mixer settler allows the plant settler area to be reduced by 30 – 50% as a result of the 
following (Hopkins and Lewis 1990): 
 The mixed phases experience centrifugal action in the cone pump before entering the launder. 
 The launder provides time for separation. 
 The separated organic phase is fed to the organic region while the aqueous phase and the dispersion 
phase are fed via an angled plate coalescer. 
Other advantages of the Krebs mixer se ttler that have been claimed include: 
 Overall size of the equipment is reduced and the layout of the plant is simplified. 
 Operation of the plant is easier. 
 Organic inventory is reduced by 30%. 
 Capital costs are reduced (foundations 45% and roofing 50%). 
 Specific flow rate is increased to 8 – 12 m3 m-2 h-1 compared to 3 – 5 m3 m-2 h-1for conventional 
mixer settlers. 
Other authors have reported challenges that remain  for those using the Krebs mixer-settler include: 
 Increased operational sensitivity to changes in  aqueous feed solution temperature and solids 
content. 
 Difficulty in maintaining desired mixer continuity  and the formation of stable emulsion band in 
settler, increasing entrainment of both phases. 
 Lack of access to the settling chamber for main tenance and the resulting difficulty in removing 
cruds, and related to this some difficulties in sampling and observing changes in settler 
performance. 
3.1.2 The vertical smooth flow (VSF) mixer settler 
The Outokumpu VSF mixer settler (Figure 6) was designed to decrease the expensive organic 
entrainment loss in SX plants by avoiding over-mixing and unnecessary air contact (Nyman et al ., 
1992, 1995 and 1998 and Pekkala et al. 1999).  It consists of a dispersion overflow pump (DOP), one 
or two mixers with double helix stirrers (a lso known as Spirok), a pre-settler and a settler.  
 
Figure 6:  A schematic of the VSF mixer-settler (Nyman et al.  1998). 
REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPR OVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  17 3.1.2.1 The DOP pump mixer.  
The DOP is equipped with a double shrouded radial turbine to decrease shea ring and small vertical 
baffles to smooth dispersion.  The DOP pump is constructed to allow th e aqueous, organic and 
recycling streams to be all introduced close to the bottom of the rotor turbine.  The conical overflow 
rim and the baffle-equipped pump cover are key features of the DOP design.  The former makes the VSF units in the SX circuit independent from each ot her and the latter makes sure that the pump is not 
disturbed by occasional introduction of air.  The solution residence time in the conical casing where 
the impeller is located is just a few seconds.  The short contact time in the central pump casing prevents the formation of under-sized droplets. 
3.1.2.2 The Spirok stirrer.  
The key feature of the Spirok (Figure 7) is its vertic al mixer circulation.  It operates in a lifting mode 
causing a down-flow in the central part and an up-flo w in the peripheral part of the mixer.  The low 
shaft power needed for this type of vertical flow liquid-liquid contacting ensures a uniform drop size 
in the dispersion, resulting in very low entrainment (Ju et al. 1991).  
 
Figure 7:  A schematic of the VSF DOP (right) and SPIROK (left) mixers (Numan et al. 1998) 
 
The VSF settler (Figure 7) has the following features (Nyman et al. 1996): 
 A feed uptake from the Spirok mixer. 
 A flow guiding primary distributor. 
 A minimum of two non-jetting picket fences. 
 A separate collecting channel near th e second fence for aqueous recycling. 
 Telescoping aqueous overflow  for level control. 
 Relatively deep settler with downstream sloping bottom. 
According to Nyman et al. (1998), the advanced VSF settler desi gn, the so-called 3D concept (i.e. a 
deep dense dispersion), offered more settling capacity .  When the dispersion bands are kept thick in 
the upstream sections, the absolute settling rate is incr eased.  It is claimed that doubling the dispersion 
bands will give a rate increase close to 60% in most  copper SX plants.  The dispersion layer filters 
small droplets and gives more flexibility to handle hi gher feed flows.  The se ttler capacity can also be 
dramatically increased by changing the dispersion c ontinuity mode from aqueous to organic.  With 
other conditions unchanged, the cha nge from aqueous continuity to organic continuity increased the 
settler capacity from 3.8 to 13.2 m3/m2/h.  The continuity stability is highly dependent on the design of 
the feed cylinder guiding the organic and aqueous solutions into the turbine. 
REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  18 3.1.3 The Lightnin mixer settler 
The Lightnin dual impeller mixer consists of a radi al impeller (R320) in the bottom of the tank to 
provide flow, head and mixing requirements, and an axial impeller (A310, A510 or A6000) in the 
larger upper part of the tank to maintain di spersion and guarantee stage efficiency (Post et al. 1996a 
and 1996b, Giralico et al. 1997, Giralico et al. 1998a and 1998b).  It was claimed that for the same 
volumetric flow rate, the A310 and A6000 impellers consume only 1/10 of the power of a typical 
impeller.   
The required retention time and flow rate determine the active area of  the settler.  The organic space 
velocity determines the width of the settler with typi cal design velocities in the range of 3-6 cm/s.  The 
flow patterns in the settler affect retention time and geometry.  Settler internals include an inlet 
launder or pipe to kill velocities, a straight or Chevron picket fence and a coalescence rail to further 
slow down the flow and to control the emulsion band  between the two phases.  An example of a flow 
pattern map in a Lightnin settler is shown in Figure 8. 
 
Figure 8: Predicted flow pattern for a Lightnin settler with picket fence and coalescence rail (Giralico et al.  
1998) 
3.1.4 The Bateman settler 
The Bateman settler was developed in an attemp t to simplify the construction, increase user 
friendliness, reduce the overall construction cost and to improve metallurgical performance of settlers 
(Vancas 2003, Anon 2004 and Vancas 2006).  It was claimed that the Batema n settler incorporates 
features that: 
 Retain the advantages of all the mixers on one end of the settlers. 
 Eliminate the point discharge of solutions into the settler. 
 Maintain good access to the settler, and 
 Reduce air entrainment. 
It has a side feed launder to obtain easy access to maintenance and sampling co mpared with the Krebs 
settler which has a launder over the settler (Figure 9).  The side feed launder al so acts as a coalescence 
enhancement channel by the use of turning vans at  the feed and discharging ends.  In addition, 
coalescence media could be added to the feed laund er and easily removed for cleaning as required.  
The organic launder is external to the settler when it flows out of the settler to allow identical aqueous 
and organic flow velocity in the settler, resulting in  less turbulence.  It was estimated that the cost 
savings of the Bateman mixer settler could be at l east 20% compared with conventional mixer settlers.

3.1.5 Improvement of settler performance 
Based on existing CFD models and possible dynamic fl ow patterns in the conventional settlers, Miller 
(2000 and 2006) summarised the enhancement of set tler performance by improving feed distribution, 
elimination of macro eddy, coalescing in deep emulsion bands (Figure 10) and the use of coalescence 
media.  
 
Figure 10:  Flow patterns in a settler with deep emulsion band at the discharge (Miller 2000). 
 
Improved feed distribution to settlers is the most ef fective means to improve settler performance.  This 
can be realised by distributing the feed evenly acro ss the full settler width to all of the settler area.  In 
recent years, improving feed distribution to  the settler has been realised by using: 
 A reverse flow settler with distribution vanes to allow the exit velocity from the mixer to be 
distributed over the full depth of the settler and to largely eliminate the formation of vertical eddies. 
 A system to distribute the feed in the centre of the settler and a series of concentric picket fences to 
generate a plug flow in the settler.  An incr ease in settler throughput of 30% and a decrease in 
entrainment of up to 70% were claimed. 
 A side feed settler to deliver the fe ed to the side of the settler behind the first angled picket fence.  
This arrangement also distributes the feed along th e full width and the full depth of the settler using 
straightening vanes, eliminating the major feed slot eddy and swirling flow.  
REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  20 The macro eddies can be eliminated either by elim inating the cause of the eddy or by dissipating the 
eddy by the use of baffles and other media.  Ve rtical and horizontal eddies can be formed in the 
feeding slots and aqueous and organic discharge points including recycling extraction points of both 
phases.  The eddy formed in the feeding slots can be eliminated by using better feed distribution 
systems as mentioned above and the eddy formed in  the discharge points can be eliminated by using 
full length overflow weirs for both phases and splitti ng the recycling flow from the total overflow 
stream.  Macro eddies could be reduced by 95% by the use of a third picket fence and random packed 
media in-settler can be efficient in dissipating their flow streams. 
It has been shown that a deep emulsion band provides a good entrainment control due to the provision 
of extra surface area to enhance coalescence activity .  Deep emulsion bands can be formed by placing 
at least two picket fences to hold  back the decreasing thickness of the emulsion band along the settler.  
Kuusisto et al. (1999) reported that the dispersion is ke pt in a compressed stat e by three DDG fences 
(Figure 11).  The dense dispersion layer filtrates small droplets and enhances coalescence, ensuring 
low entrainment. 
 
Figure 11:  The DDG fence operating principle (Kuusisto et al.  1999). 
 
Further enhancement of settler performance can be achieved by the use of coalescence media, 
resulting in either increase in settler cap acity or decrease in entrainment.  
 
3.2 In-Line Mixers 
3.2.1 The Kenics in-line mixer 
The Kenics In-line Mixer is an in-line, contin uous non-moving-part mixing and processing device 
(Ritcey 2006).  Flow division and radial mixing are the two main mixing mechanisms in the tubular housing device (Figure 12).  Mixing can be controlle d and predicted due to the uniform shear forces 
within the device, resulting in a very narrow drop size distribution.  The average drop size depends on 
the diameter of the device, the flow rate and the physical properties of the two phases.  The ability to 
control drop size in SX operations allows optimisation of both interfacial area for mass transfer and 
the time for phase separation.  The in-line device a voids remixing, as occurs in conventional mixers, 
resulting in a considerable saving of solvent and en ergy consumption.  Other advantages include no or 
low maintenance cost, low operating cost, fast and simple processing, facilitation of online automatic 
control, reproducibility, consiste ncy in product quality and no noise.

3.2.2 The Lightnin in-line mixer 
The Lightnin in-line mixer consists of adjustable vanes to make it possible to obtain various mixing 
patterns and therefore different drop size distributions .  The Lightnin internals are shown in Figure 13.  
This in-line mixer was piloted to recover uranium from sulphuric acid leach solutions (Ritcey, 2006).  
The advantages of Lightnin in-line mixer include: 
 No requirement to maintain specific phase continuity in mixing. 
 Decreased solvent inventory due to no recycling requirement. 
 High mass transfer efficiency obtained without high shear and turbulence. 
 No air involved in mixing. 
 Improved settling rates. 
 Decreased stable emulsion and crud formati on, and therefore decreased solvent losses. 
 Decreased settler area.

  22 3.2.3 The Koch-Glisch in-line mixer settler 
Neuman et al. (2002) and Cusack et al. (2003) proposed a new concept ”p lant in a pipe“ for an in-line 
mixer-settler (Figure 14) by the use of: 
 Separate pumps to avoid high shear and large amount of very fine droplets. 
 A mixer section equipped with internals to provide high intensity, plug flow  mixing with uniform 
shear and residence time of 1-3 seconds. 
 A reactor section designed to maintain dispersion created in the mixer and also to provide plug 
flow circulation of droplets, which promote mass transfer with residence time of 10-30 seconds. 
 A settler equipped with internals that promote laminar flow to aid droplet settling, to provide 
channels for the coalesced droplets to drain to interface and to prevent any solids or crud from 
accumulating with a typical residence time of 2 minutes. 
 
Figure 14: A simplified flowsheet of using “plant in pipe” mixer-settler (Cusack et al.  2003). 
 
In addition, coalescers could be added to both phase s after leaving the settler to provide appropriate 
media to promote coalescence with a typical residence time of 1-2 minutes.  Another feature is that the system is closed to the atmosphere  to prevent the presence of oxygen.  
The net effect of the combination of these features is a very compact system with very high yields and 
a very small volume of about 20-30% of those for conventional mixer settlers at the same throughput.  
This design leads to modular construction offsite a nd the units can be transported to site for re-
assembly.  This is impossible for conventional mixer settlers.  
The concept was tested  with a real copper plant leach solution in parallel to the plant stream using a 
unit with a capacity of 2.5 gallon per minute (g/m ) or about 9.5 litre per minute (L/m) and later 
progressed to a much larger unit with a capacity of 100 g/m or 375 L/m.  Test results were favourable 
to the new concept.  The extraction was very high  with reduced residence time and approached a 
100% theoretical stage.  The extraction level w as much higher than those for conventional mixer 
settlers.  In addition, the separation of copper fro m iron was found very high  probably due to short 
residence time, indicating the wash stage could be omitted. 
3.3 Pulsed Columns 
The pulsed column is a contactor for performing di fferential counter-current solvent extraction with 
agitation generated by pulsation.  Compared with ot her kinds of solvent extraction contactors, the 
pulsed column features a simple design without moving parts, flexibility in using any desired materials 
including metals, glass and plastic, ability to handle feed streams containing suspended solids, ability  
REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  23 to easily maintain stable operation with any d esired phase continuity, and consecutive dispersing and 
coalescing of the desired phase.  Therefore, sma ller footprint area requirement, lower capital and 
operating costs are expected than the conventional mixer-settler. 
There are two main designs of pulsed columns: th e pulsed sieve-plate pulsed column and the Bateman 
Pulsed Disc-Doughnut column (BPC) (Lerner 2006).  Th e former has been used for several decades in 
industry while the latter is one of the more successful , installed recently in the extractive industries. 
The structure of a typical BPC shown in Figure 15, consists of: 
 A cylindrical active contacting section filled with internals - sieve plates or disc and doughnut type, 
which are consecutively staggered. 
 Bottom decanter (settler) in which the heavier/a queous phase fully separates and is removed for 
further processing. 
 Top decanter (settler) in which the lighter/organ ic phase fully separates and overflows for further 
processing. 
The features of the BPC are: 
 The hydrodynamic performance is mainly a functio n of the pulsation intensity (PI) in addition to 
the flux physical properties such as density, viscosity and interfacial tension.  
 Mass transfer occurs in the active contacting sec tion (the holdup section), featuring a relatively 
homogeneous dispersion.   
 Drop size tends to decrease with increased pulsati on intensity with typical BPC average drop sizes 
being 1.5-3 mm (regular) and 0.75-1.5 mm (fine) wh ich are coarser than those with conventional 
mixer settlers. 
 Axial flow components always exist which reduces the efficiency of mass transfer and thus 
increases the column height which becomes si gnificant at higher O/A ratios of 10-8:1. 
 BPC can operate with systems having interfacial te nsion as low as 0.5-0.6 dyne/cm compared with 
about 1.2 dyne/cm required by other types of contacting columns. 
 
Figure 15:  Disc and Doughnut Internals of BPC with its elements and control (Lerner, 2006). 
 
Bateman Advanced Technology Ltd has recently in troduced to the solvent extraction industry the 
concept of Intermediate Decanter positioned in the middle of the column (Kleinberger 2004).  This 
allows simultaneously consecutive different operati ons, e.g. extraction and stripping accomplished in 
one column.

  24 3.4 Centrifugal Contractors 
The annular centrifugal contactor is a new develo pment and has been commercially employed in 
numerous liquid-liquid extraction applications.  It  operates as both separator and contactor which 
provides mixing and separation in a single compact unit (Law, et al., 2006, Figure 16).  Mixing and 
disengaging times range from 10 to 30 seconds each, de pending on the feed rate to the unit and unit 
size.  Single stage efficiencies of 90% or higher ar e typical for solvent extraction systems with rapid 
kinetics.  Continuous separation, washing, and extr action processes often require many steps or stages 
to achieve desired product quality or required extrac tion efficiencies.  Centrifugal contactors can be 
readily interconnected to allow multistage processes (Meikrantz, et al., 2002, Figure 17).  Pumps are 
not required to feed from stage to stage because the discharge ports ar e at a higher elevation than the 
inlets.  Such a system occupies only a fraction of the operating floor space of a corresponding batch 
process. 
 
Figure 16: Cutaway view of Centrifugal Housing (Law, et al.  2006). 
 
Figure 17: Three-stage counter current wash scheme using centrifugal contractors. 
 
The annular centrifugal contactor was first develope d in the early 1960s (Davis and Jennings, 1961).  
It was gradually improved during the 60s-80s (Webster, et al., 1969; Bernstein, et al., 1973; Leonard, 
et al., 1980).  Commercialisation of this technology be gan in 1990 (Meikrantz, 1990).  A number of 
design enhancements have since b een made, resulting in a device be ing well suited to many liquid-
liquid processes.  Multiple sizes were designed to pr ovide total throughput ra nging from 0.1 to 200 
gallons per minute (Meikrantz et al ., 1997 and 1998).  Annular centrifugal contactors with rotor 
diameters of 5 cm to 51 cm which range in throughput from 2 L to 750 L per minute are now 
commercially available. 
REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  25 Claimed important advantages of centrifugal contac tors versus mixer-settlers or pulsed columns 
include: 
 Reagent inventory is much less, especially for the processes where extractants are expensive. 
 Organic losses are reduced due to less orga nic entrainment and closed operation.  
 Reduced footprint (floor space/area) required due to  relatively large operating capacity for the size 
of the equipment.  
The disadvantages of the annular centrifugal contactors are:  
 They are not suitable for slow mass transf er systems due to short residence time.  
 They are not flexible because all parameters must  be strictly designed according to the target 
system. 
 They do not tolerate solids and third phases. 
3.5 Summary and Recommendations 
The design of equipment for solvent extraction al ways faces dual (and to a large degree contrary) 
basic requirements: good mixing or dispersion of th e two phases to obtain appropriate/optimal mass 
transfer rates and quick and complete settlement or coalescence to increa se process efficiency and 
throughput for a unit.  To achieve this, traditional mixer settlers have been modified and improved and 
a range of new equipment has been developed.  
Over the last 2-3 decades, traditional mixer settlers have been improved by:  
 Placing the settler feed launder on the top of the settle r (the Krebs mixer settler) or at the side of the 
settler (the Bateman settler) to enhance phase separa tion and to shorten the distance of the settler 
discharge points to the next stage mixer.  Selec tive recycles have been introduced to modify the 
apparent phase ratios in settlers and enhance phase separation. 
 Designing better mixer arrangement and better stirrers to avoid over-mixing and increase 
transportation capability (the VSF mixer settler). 
 Designing a better feed distribution system to impr ove flow patterns in the settler with distribution 
vanes, chevrons, fences, etc. including aspects of the VSF mixer settler and the Lightnin mixer-
settler. 
 Placing picket fences (of which there are numerous designs in the industry), dispersion distribution 
gates or coalescence media in the settler to form  a deep emulsion section and to combat macro 
eddies and micro droplets. 
Equipment new to the minerals industry has been introduced and adapted, such as a pulsed column 
(BPC) and completely new ideas have been deve loped (Kenics and Lightnin in-line mixer and The 
Koch-Glisch in-line mixer settler).  All this new equipment aims to obtain better and controllable 
mixing and settling, so that high mass transfer effici encies can be obtained, entrainment losses reduced 
and hence the need for expensive (top-up or repl acement) solvent reduced, and capital and operation 
costs saved. 
Columns and particularly Bateman pulsed columns ha ve been installed and ope rated at a small number 
of metallurgical operations, selected over mixer settlers for varying reas ons and no doubt operated 
with varying degrees of success.  Centrifugal contact ors have not had significant uptake in the industry 
to date and possibly are awaiting higher valu e niche applications to have their day. REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  26 Much of the change in equipment has been evolu tionary and / or incremental and other more step 
changes have not yielded all the anticipated benef its.  Certainly what has been modified / improved 
has depended upon not only operational needs but al so on the engineers and engineering company 
involved, geography and other factors.  As a con sequence of the survey and supported by sponsors’ 
experience it was clear that a more scientific approach to generically improve unit operation design and performance was needed and much of this  underlies the focus of the SXT work.  One 
recommendation from this study is that fundamental research using advanced physical and 
mathematical modelling techniques such as CFD is need ed to better understand the flow behaviours in 
the settler.  Theoretical study of the new equipmen t such as pulsed columns and in-line mixer settlers 
is also warranted. REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  27 4. MASS TRANSFER IN META LLURGICAL SOLVENT 
EXTRACTION: A LITERATURE REVIEW 
4.1 General Background 
Solvent extraction involves the contacting of an aqueous phase with an immiscible organic liquid 
phase for the purpose of transferring a dissolved compone nt (solute) of interest between the phases, so 
as to concentrate or separate the solute.  In general, an aqueous phase is introduced containing the 
dissolved species of value, and the dissolved species is transferred pr eferentially to the organic solvent 
in the extraction contacting stage.  The extracted solute is then recove red in a stripping operation.  The 
solvent is then purified and recycled to the extracti on stage.  In metallurgical  plants, solvent extraction 
forms part of the flow sheet in the production of a number of metals, including copper, nickel, cobalt, 
zinc, precious metals, uraniu m and rare earth metals.  
In the solvent extraction of meta ls, the dissolved metal species in aqueous solution, as obtained from 
leaching operations, is typically present as a hydrated ion species making it insoluble in non-polar 
organic solvents.  In order to transfer the metalli c species of interest from the aqueous to the organic 
phase, the metal ion must therefore be converted into  a form which is soluble in the organic phase.  
For this purpose an additional reagent is normall y introduced, a so-called extractant, which is 
necessary to form a chemical compound (or complex) w ith the solute and thus make it soluble in the 
organic phase.  Where solvent extraction is enabled by  a chemical reaction, the process is referred to 
as reactive solvent extraction.  The reaction may occu r at the interface of the aqueous/organic mixture 
or in one or both of the bulk phases.  Practically  all solvent extraction processes for metals may be 
classified as reactive.  
Thus, due to the need for an ex tracting reagent, the organic solv ent in a metal extraction operation 
consists of at least two components, the extractant and the diluent.  The extractant is chosen for its 
chemical properties (selectivity, reaction rate etc.), while the diluent is chosen mainly for its physical 
properties, e.g. density difference compared to th e aqueous phase, its viscosity, interfacial surface 
tension, vapour pressure and stability.  Diluents  are typically aliphatic-type compounds, such as 
kerosene or n-decane, which are chosen for low toxi city, low cost etc.  The organic solvent often 
contains additional components called modifiers.  These are added, for example, to prevent the build-
up of crud. 
4.2 Extraction Reagents 
A large number of reagents are available for solv ent extraction.  A common way of classifying these 
reagents is according to the extr acting mechanism.  Types of extr actant include (Ritcey and Ashbrook, 
1984; Cox, 2004): 
 Compound formation: reacting the metal ion with a suitable ion of opposite charge to form a 
neutral complex. 
 Ion association: formation of an uncharged ion pair. 
 Solvation: replacing the water of hydration with  molecules of an organic solvating reagent. 
Extractants of the compound-forming type are furt her classified as acidic or acidic chelating. 
With acidic extractants, the hydrogen atom of th e extractant is exchanged for the metal ion: 
MA H M AHn nn , (1) 
The overbar indicates a species in the organic ph ase and other species are taken as being in the 
aqueous phase.  Reagents of this type of commercia l interest include organic derivatives of phosphoric REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  28 acids, e.g. D2EHPA (di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric aci d), and carboxylic acids e.g. versatic acid and 
naphthenic acids. 
Chelating extractants are those which contain donor  groups capable of forming bidentate complexes 
with metal ions.  Commercially available chelati ng extractants include various hydroxyoximes with 
commercial names such as LIX and Acorga, and s ubstituted 8-hydroxyquinolines (Kelex, LIX 34).  
Figure 18 illustrates the structure of a copper ion chelate, with two hydroxyoxime ligands.  
Reactions of metal cations with acidic or acidic ch elating reagents can be regarded as ion exchange 
reactions.  The extraction is an equilibrium-driven process and so the rate de pends on the position of 
equilibrium.  Since hydrogen ion dissociation is involved, the pH of the system is important.  
Extractants involving ion association include primar y, secondary, and tertiary amines and quaternary 
ammonium salts.  The general procedure is that th e amine in the organic phase firstly extracts an acid 
from the aqueous phase to form an ion pair (salt) in the organic.  Then upon contacting with an 
aqueous phase containing an anionic metal species , exchange occurs, leadin g to an ion associated 
species in the organic which contains the metal.  This can be written as: 
 .X NHR HXNR3 3   (2) 
    X .MY NHR MY .X NHR3 3   (3) 
Amine extractants are used in some commercial pr ocesses for nickel/cobalt, where the cobalt as an 
anionic chloro complex can be selectively extracted, usually with a tertiary amine.  Amines are also 
used in uranium production, but the mechanism is somewhat different. 
 
Figure 18. Example of copper ion chelate complex with two hydroxyoxime ligands (Cox, 2004). 
 
With solvating extractants, the metal ion becomes solvated by an electron donor reagent.  This 
increases the solubility of the inorganic species in the organic phase.  These include a range of 
reagents such as organophosphate esters and sulfur-containing analogues of these esters. 
4.3 Examples of Industrial Applications 
Some specific examples used in commercial so lvent extraction operations are as follows. 
4.3.1 Copper 
Many operations use a hydroxyoxime-based extractant, in conjunction with an acidic leach solution 
(usually sulfuric acid).  Commercial extractants of th is type include the LIX and Acorga series.  These 
include hydroxyoximes based on benzophenone (LIX 64) or acetophenone (LIX 84).  These are 
chelating acidic extractants, which form a complex with two hydroxyoxime molecules per copper ion, 
with the two oxime molecules also linked by hydr ogen bonds.  Improvements have been made over 
the years to reagents of this type, including modifying the groups on branches of the molecule, and 
addition of modifiers (Cox, 2004).  
REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  29 4.3.2 Nickel 
In hydrometallurgical routes for nickel produc tion, solvent extraction processes must achieve 
separation of nickel from cobalt, which is complicat ed by their similar chemical behaviour.  Various 
flowsheets have been implemented (Cox, 2004).  For example, the Bulong process involves treating 
ore by acid pressure leaching, after which the leachat e is neutralised with lime and filtered.  In the 
solvent extraction step, the filtrate is firs t contacted with a mixture of di-2,4,4-
trimethylpentylphosphinic acid (Cyanex 272, an acidic extractant) and tri-n-butylphosphate (TBP, a 
solvating extractant), to extract cobalt and reject nick el.  The nickel is then extracted from the raffinate 
using a carboxylic acid (Versatic acid). 
In the Murrin Murrin process, ore is also treated by  acid pressure leaching (Cox, 2004).  The leachate 
is neutralised and clarified, then nickel, cobalt and other metals are precipitated from solution with 
hydrogen sulfide.  The su lfides are redissolved in an oxygen leach  to produce a sulfate liquor.  This 
liquor is contacted with Cyanex 272, leading to extraction firstly of zinc, then of cobalt (with pH 
adjustment).  Separate solutions of cobalt and nick el are then treated by hydrogen reduction to recover 
the metals.  
4.4 Equilibrium between phases 
In the contacting of an organic extracting phase with a metal-loaded aqueous phase, the metal is 
transferred between phases since the mixture is in itially not at equilibrium, but is driven towards 
equilibrium with sufficient contacting time.  The fi nal possible degree of extraction therefore depends 
both on the equilibrium distribution, and the rate of mass transfer, and both aspects must be taken into 
account in a computational model. 
A simple approach towards describing the equilibrium distribution is the use of a distribution ratio.  A 
solute ‘A’, which is initially dissolved in only one  of the two contacting liquid phases, eventually 
becomes distributed between the phases and at equili brium, a distribution ratio can be defined as (Cox 
and Rydberg, 2004): 
 aqorgA AD ,  (4) 
where [A] org and [A] aq are the concentrations in the organi c and aqueous phases respectively.  The 
extent of extraction can also be de fined by the percentage extraction, E, and this is related to the 
distribution ratio as: 
) 1( 100 D D E  .  (5) 
Where there are several dissolved species, their individual distribution ratios are defined as D A, D B etc.  
A difference in D values means that A can be separated fro m B, in a single or multistage extraction 
process.  Good performance of the extraction pro cess requires a favourable equilibrium between the 
aqueous and organic phases, with both high distribu tion coefficient and selectivity.  The distribution 
coefficient is affected by the concentration of various species, the temperature, the pH, and other 
factors. 
For detailed modelling of an extraction process, eq uilibrium constants must be determined for the 
overall reaction, and where a reacti on mechanism is proposed, equilib rium constants are needed for 
each reaction.  Data for reactive solvent extracti on systems are more limited than for physical 
extraction, though Bart and Stevens (2004) listed se veral possible sources of data.  Equilibrium 
constants need to take into account non-ideal solu te behaviour.  Moerters and Bart (2003) used a 
computer program, SXLSQI (Baes et al ., 1990), to determine equilib rium constants for the ZnSO 4-
D2EHPA complex.  (This program was at one stage fr eely available on the internet, but not at present, 
but may still be available from Oak Ridge National Laboratory.) 
 REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  30 4.5 Factors controlling the mass transfer rate 
The solvent extraction process involves the transfer of one or more species from the bulk of one phase, 
to the interface between phases, and then into the bulk  of the other phase.  In general, the overall rate 
of mass transfer will depend on the interfacial ar ea, a concentration driving force, and a rate 
coefficient.  In non-reactive extraction, the rate is  controlled by a combination of convection in the 
bulk of each phase and molecular diffusion across the interface, but in reactive extraction the rate may 
be controlled by the kinetics of chemical reaction steps.  For example, the formation of the metal-
ligand complex may be relatively slow .  In general, the overall rate w ill be a combination of physical 
diffusion and chemical kinetics, and careful inves tigation may be needed to determine the relative 
contributions (Danesi, 2004).  The rate of extracti on will also be a function of the composition of the 
system (including pH), temperature, and the nature of the solvent. 
4.6 Physical solvent extraction 
In physical solvent extraction without reactions, the process is driven by a departure from the 
equilibrium distribution of a solute between the two phases.  However, it is typically assumed that the 
solute is in equilibrium distribution at the interface.   This is illustrated in Figures 19 and 20.  The 
transfer is driven by a difference between bulk and interface concentrations, and a mass transfer 
coefficient, kY or kX, can be introduced such that the mass tr ansfer rate is given by (Skelland, 1992): 
* *
A A X A A Y A X XAk Y YAkAN     (6) 
where X A and Y A are the mass fractions of species A in the heavy and light phases respectively, X*
A 
and Y*
A are interfacial mass fractions, and A is the interfaci al area.  (The mass transfer rate can also be 
written equivalently in terms of mo le fractions, or mass or mole concentrations.)  However, since 
interface concentrations are rarely known, the ma ss transfer rate is redefined in terms of a 
concentration driving force related to the concentra tions which would be expect ed when equilibrium is 
reached.  Thus, the mass transfer coefficien t defined with the overall coefficients K Y and K X, can be 
written as (Skelland, 1992): 
AL A X AL A Y A X XAK Y YAKAN      (7) 
where Y AL is the light liquid concentration that would be  in equilibrium with the existing heavy liquid 
concentration (and similarly for concentration X in the heavy phase). 
Overall coefficients can be related to  individual coefficients according to: 
x Y Y km
k K1 1    (8) 
Y X X km k K 1 1 1  (9) 
where the coefficients m and m relate to the equilibrium distribution between phases.  The distribution

4.7 Reactive Solve nt Extraction 
In reactive solvent extraction, the mass transfer is not a simple physical process; a series of chemical 
reactions is also involved, e.g. dissociation of the extractant, removal of solvating water, formation of 
chelated ion species etc.  These may include reactions  in the bulk of each phase, in vicinity of the 
interfaces, or at the interface.  Any one or more reaction steps may be rate determining, and the 
expression for the resistance to mass transfer will take various forms dependi ng on the details of the 
mechanism.  An essential differe nce is that the various chemical species are generally not in 
equilibrium at the interface, except at th e very end of the extraction process. 
A rate limiting step is often the formation of the metal-ligand complex.  The site of this reaction 
depends on the solubility of the extractant.  With acidic extractants (e.g. carboxylic acids), the reaction 
may occur in the bulk of the aqueous phase, but w ith chelating extractants, the reaction site may be 
expected to be at the interface, because of the mu ch lower aqueous solubility of these extractants.  
In general, the overall rate may be controlled by the chemical kinetics alone, the physical diffusion 
alone, or a combination.  Danesi (2004) has discus sed some possible scenarios.  Where the extraction 
is controlled by kinetics, it is necessary to determ ine the form of the kinetic rate law.  This is 
complicated, because the form of the rate law is  not necessarily related to the overall reaction 
stoichiometry, but depends on the rate of individual elemental steps (Bart and Stevens, 2004).  
REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  32 Furthermore, experimentally determined trends in extraction data can often be explained plausibly by 
more than one possible mechanism (Danesi, 2004). 
One approach to describing the rate in reactive so lvent extraction is to propose a modified overall 
mass transfer coefficient, incorporating an additi onal resistance due to chemical kinetics.  Thus, 
assuming an irreversible first order reaction, 
Y R X X km k k K 1 1 1 1  (11) 
Such an approach assumes a simple linear concen tration difference as the driving force.  More 
complicated chemical mechanisms will require a more  complicated mathematical description (e.g. see 
Baba et al., 2002). 
4.8 Mass Transfer Regimes 
The overall mass transfer rate may be controlled by diffusion or chemical kinetics, or a mixed regime 
may prevail.  In the case of diffusion control, the resistance may be in the dispersed or continuous 
phase, or both.  Various experimental techniques ha ve been devised with the aim of determining the 
rate controlling step, and measuring rate constants for these resistances.  In the case of chemical 
kinetic control, further experiments may be undertak en in order to determine the form of the rate 
equation, or the underlying mechanisms.  Distingui shing between diffusional and kinetic regimes may 
be difficult because the rate of extraction may show the same dependen ce on hydrodynamic and 
concentration parameters (Danesi,  2004).  Frequently used criteria to distinguish between diffusional 
and kinetic regimes are: 
 Comparison of the heat transfer and mass tran sfer coefficients: if these exhibit the same 
dependence on the rate of stirring, then the extraction is occurring in a diffusional regime. 
 Evaluation of the activation energy of extraction: if  the rate is controlled by a chemical reaction, 
the activation energy may be relatively high. 
 The reference substance method: an additional iner t substance is extracted  simultaneously; similar 
dependence on hydrodynamics indicates a diffusional regime. 
 Dependency of the rate of extraction on the rate of st irring of the two phases.  This is carried out in 
a Lewis-type cell or vigorously mixed flask.  A process occurring under diffusional control shows 
an increase in rate with increased stirring rate, wh ereas if the rate of extraction is independent of 
stirring, a kinetic regime may be supposed.  Bu t the ‘plateau’ region may indicate other effects, 
such as a constant thickness of diffusi on films despite increased stirring.  
Even in the absence of diffusional resistances, th ere are still difficulties in determining the rate 
mechanism and law, since more than one mechanism can  be proposed that fits the experimental data.  
According to Danesi (2004), these ambiguities are onl y partly reduced by studying the extraction rate 
over a very broad range of concen trations of the reagents and by varying the interfacial area. 
4.9 Kinetic Control 
Danesi (2004) outlined three simp le mechanisms which have been  found suitable for interpreting 
solvent extraction rates in the kinetic regime.  An  example reaction is given in which a monovalent 
metal cation M+ is extracted with a weakly acidic reagent, BH.  The overall reaction is: 
  H MB BH M   (12) 
The overbar again indicates that th e species in the organic phase.  The extraction equilibrium constant 
is given by: REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY

Case 1:  The rate-determining step is the aqueous phase formation of a complex between the metal ion 
and the anion of the extractant.  
The rate determining step is: 
MB B M  (14) 
with a forward rate constant k1 and backward rate constant k-1. 
The reaction rate expression is: 
[MB] ]B][M[d]M[d-1 1 

This rate expression can be expressed in terms of more readily measurable quantities, assuming 
equilibrium amongst various other species.  This leads to the expression:

   (16) 
where the additional equilibrium constants relate to  the partitioning of BH and MB between phases, 
and the dissociation of BH in the aqueous phase.  It can be noted that, if this mechanism holds, the rate 
of extraction is independent of the interfacial area.  
The apparent values of the rate c onstants can be determined by plotting the rate of extraction of the 
metal as a function of ]BH[  at constant ]H[; as a function of ]H[ for constant ]BH[ ; and as a 
function of ]MB[  at constant ]H[ and ]BH[ .  Furthermore, it is useful to measure the rate for 
varying specific interfacial area, at constant reag ent concentrations.  If there is no dependency on 
interfacial area, then the mechanis m of Case 1 may be applicable.  
This mechanism has been applied in modelling systems such as Zn2+, Ni2+ and Co2+ with dithizone and 
its derivatives. 
Case 2: The rate-determining step is the formation at th e interface of a complex between the metal ion 
and the interfacially absorbed extractant.   
Here, the reaction steps are:

which applies under the assumptions of a fully satura ted interface.  The equilibrium constant for the

It can be seen that the rate depends on the interfaci al area per unit volume.  The individual constants in 
Kex may be hard to obtain.  
This mechanism has been used, with minor m odifications, in describing systems such as Cu2+ and Fe3+ 
with hydroxyoxime extractants.  
Case 3: There are two rate-determining steps, consisting of formation of a complex at the interface, 
and transfer of the interfacial metal-extractant co mplex to the bulk organic phase, accompanied by 
simultaneous adsorption of an extractant molecule at the interfacial vacancy.  
In this case, the rate determin ing equations may be written as: 
adMB B M 

MB BH BH MBad ad   with forward and reve rse rate constants k 4, k-4.  (24) 
With the assumption of a low metal concentration, MB ad is assumed to have a constant value, and then 
the rates of the two equations can be assumed equa l.  Assuming complete saturation of the interface, 
then the adsorbed concentration of BH is constant, that is: 
2 adBH][ .   (25) 
Also, taking into account the dissociation of adsorbed BH,

In the case of sufficiently low concentr ation of the extractant, such that ]BH[4k is much less than 3k, 
then the rate laws according to Cases 1, 2 a nd 3 all show exactly the same dependence on the 
concentration of metal and hydrogen ions in the aq ueous phase and extractant in the organic phase.  
Then, the difference between the mechanisms can only be identified by measuring the dependence on 
the interfacial area and by using the broadest possible concentration range of the reactants.  
4.10 Diffusion Control 
Danesi (2004) discusses a couple of cases where the reaction rates are fast enough so that only 
diffusion resistances occur.  The analysis is similar to purely physical extraction.  However, since this REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  35 situation is not likely to occur with commercial reacti ve extractions, it is not discussed in further detail 
here. 
4.11 Mixed Diffusion Kinetic Control 
A mixed diffusion-kinetic regime occurs when one or more of the chemical reaction steps proceeds at 
a rate comparable with that of the diffusion proces ses through the interfacial films.  The analytical 
description of a mixed regime is complicated.  To full y describe the rate of ex traction, the equations of 
diffusion and chemical reaction should be solved simu ltaneously.  This is somewhat simplified for the 
case where the slow chemical step is heterogeneous, occurring at the interface.  This is often the case 
due to the low aqueous solubility of the extracting reag ent.  Then, the chemical reaction rates appear in 
the boundary conditions of the equatio ns describing the diffusion process.  A possible procedure then 
involves modifying the ‘two-film’ theory to account fo r the additional resistance at the interface due to 
chemical reaction.  Even if this is the case, interp retation of experimental ex traction rate data requires 
detailed information on the rates of diffusion of di fferent chemical species.  To avoid ambiguity, 
chemical kinetics at the interface must be known from separate experiments carried out in a pure 
kinetic regime.  
An example is given (‘Case 6’ of Danesi, 2004) in which the extraction is considered to consist of a 
slow interfacial partition reaction of an uncharged species between aqueous and organic phases, in 
combination with diffusion of the partitioning sp ecies to and from the interface.  The reaction is: 
iA Ai  with forward and reve rse rate constants k 1, k-1      (29)

If the diffusion is very fast, then this simplifies to: 
 ]A[ A1 1  Sk Sk Rate ,  (33) 
in which case the transfer rate depends only on the chemical kinetic rates and the interfacial area.  
4.12 Estimating the Mass Transfer Coefficient 
Many theories have been put forward to explain the mass transfer mechanism and predict the mass 
transfer coefficient.  These theo ries include (Skelland, 1992) the ‘film theory’, various ‘surface 
renewal’ theories, and various ‘boundary layer’ theo ries.  An early theory is the ‘two-film’ theory, 
which conceptualised that all the resistance to mass tr ansfer lies in fictitious films on either side of the 
interface, where transfer occurs only by molecular diffu sion.  This concept is illustrated in Figure 20.  
However, this theory does not agree well with expe rimental observations; for example, it predicts that 
the mass transfer coefficient is proportional to the diffusivity, D AB, whereas it is usually found to be 
proportional to Dn
AB , where n < 1.  Therefore, other theories have been put forward, taking into 
account factors such as turbulence and the interm ittent arrival of eddies at the interface.  REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  36 Another approach to predicting mass transfer coeffici ents is by the correlation of experimental data.  
By dimensional analysis, various non-dimensional groups  have been identified with which data can be 
correlated.  Thus, it is typical to correlate a Sherwood number (containing the mass transfer 
coefficient) in terms of groups including the Rey nolds number, Schmidt number, Peclet number, and 
Fourier number (for unsteady transfer).  These are defined as: 
DkdSh   (34) 
CT cdV
Re   (35) 
DSc  (36) 
ScRe Pe  (37) 
2
2


dDtFo  (38) 
where k is the mass transfer coefficient, d is the drop diameter, D is the molecular diffusivity, C is the 
continuous phase density, C is the continuous phase viscosity, VT is drop terminal velocity, and t is 
time.  Sherwood and Schmidt numbers may be defi ned for either the continuous or the dispersed 
phase.  
There are a large number of published correlations, wh ich often have quite diffe rent forms.  A large 
number of these were reviewed by Kumar and Hartland (1999). 
4.13 Droplet Hydrodynamics 
Before further discussion of liquid-liquid mass tran sfer coefficients, it is appropriate to give some 
consideration to the hydrodynamic behaviour of di spersed droplets, since this affects their mass 
transfer characteristics.  Furthermore, unders tanding of droplet behaviour is important in 
computational modelling, such as in pr ediction of droplet slip velocities. 
Several distinct regimes of droplet behaviour may be identified (Winnikow and Chao, 1966; Greene et 
al., 1993).  These regimes show a difference in behavi our of the drag coefficient as a function of the 
Reynolds number, as illustrated in Figure 21 (fo llowing Winnikow and Chao, 1966).  Regime I, 
according to Winnikow and Chao, corresponds to sma ll droplets at a Reynolds number less than one, 
i.e. in the creeping flow regime.  These have a sp herical shape, and rise or fall (depending on the 
relative liquid densities) in a quiescent liquid at a steady terminal velocity which can be calculated 
from a correlation for the drag coefficient as a functi on of Reynolds number.  If the liquids are highly 
purified, the drag coefficient corresponds to that of  a fluid sphere, e.g. the correlations of Hadamard 
(1911) and Rybczynski (1911).  More commonly, the system is contaminated to some extent by 
surfactants, and then the drag coefficient falls some where between that for a fluid sphere, and that for 
a rigid sphere (Stokes law). 
At somewhat higher Reynolds numbers, droplets tend towards an ellipsoidal or lenticular shape 
(Regime II).  The droplet motion remains rectilinear and steady, the drag coefficient continues to 
decrease with increasing Reynolds number (Wi nnikow and Chao, 1966), and its value again lies 
between the limits for fluid and rigid spheres.  A cr itical value of Reynolds number is then reached, 
where the drag coefficient is a minimum and the term inal velocity is a maximum.  This critical point 
corresponds to the onset of  oscillating motion (Clift et al., 1978), which leads to a rapid increase in 
drag coefficient and reduction in terminal veloc ity beyond this point.  Therefore, larger bubbles REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  37 beyond the point of onset of oscillation have a drag  coefficient that increases with Reynolds number 
(Regime III).  
According to Winnikow and Chao (1966), as indica ted in Figure 21, the onset of oscillating motion 
occurs at a Reynolds number of about 300–800.  But in fact, the controlling factor in the deformation 
of droplets and subsequent onset of  oscillation is the interfacial su rface tension between continuous 
and dispersed phases, which can be described in term s of an additional dimensionless parameter, such 
as the Eotvos number (Clift et al., 1978) or a Weber number.  Thus, Greene et al. (1993) found that 
the onset of droplet oscillation could occur at  Reynolds numbers anywhere between 8 and 1000, 
depending on the particular chemical system.  Greene et al . (1993) reviewed measurements for 
systems of a wide range of properties, and proposed  that the critical point for onset of oscillation can 
be given by: 
0.65We Re 165crit crit ,  (39) 
where the Reynolds number is defined according to equation (35) and the Weber number is given by: 
2
WeCTρVd
σ , (40) 
where C is the continuous phase density, VT is the terminal velocity, d is the droplet diameter, and  is 
the surface tension.  
Greene et al . (1993) further proposed that the drag coefficient in the regime of droplet oscillation 
could be calculated by reference to the drag co efficient and Reynolds number at the critical point, 
according to:  
1.12

ReD
D crit critC
C
 (41) 
There are many other correlations for drag coeffici ent or terminal velocity in liquid-liquid systems 
which are available in the literature.  One earlier  correlation of note is that according to Clift et al.  
(1978), who based their correlation on a very broa d range of data.  Their correlation allows the 
calculation of the terminal velocity as a function of viscosity ratio and Reynolds, Eotvos and Morton 
numbers.  Another study is that according to Klee and Treybal (1956), who correlated the drag 
coefficient as a function of Reynolds and Webe r numbers.  Skelland (1992) found that their 
correlation was reasonably adequate for a range of systems, providing that the effect of surfactants 
was accounted for, by applying the actual measur ed surface tension of the particular system. 
The exact determination of the drag coefficient a nd corresponding terminal velocity is complicated by 
uncertainty as to the level of surfactants.  For example, Clift et al . (1978) reviewed experimental 
measurements from six studies of carbon tetrachloride droplets in water.  Over a range of sizes from 
2 mm to 6 mm diameter, the measured termin al velocities differed widely among different 
investigators, which can be attributed to different levels of system purity.  Depending on the level of 
impurities, the internal motion is damped out to differing degrees, leading to different drag 
coefficients, between the limits for a fluid sphere in  a highly purified system, and a rigid sphere with a 
surface saturated by surfactants.  Surfactants tend to  have the greatest influence near the point of 
transition from steady to oscillating motion.  This  relates to effects on the wake structure and 
subsequent delayed boundary layer separation.  Several authors have  made measurements in highly 
purified systems, but this is not relevant to ordina ry industrial systems, and especially with solvent 
extraction, the extracting reagent necessarily has su rface activity.  Therefore, correlations derived from 
experiments with surfactants present are of more rele vance.  Most experimental  measurements have in 
fact been carried out for “grossly contaminated” systems (Clift et al ., 1978).  However, a level of 
uncertainty remains in applying correlations since the type and concentration of contaminants has 
rarely been quantified.  REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  38 An additional consideration is that available correlations have generally been derived from 
measurements of an individual droplet.  The droplet  ‘swarm’ effect should also be taken into account, 
by calculating the drag coefficient as a function of  dispersed phase volume, as proposed, for example, 
by Ishii and Zuber (1979).  
Yet another consideration is the effect of Marangoni convection on the drag coefficient, as described 
below in Section 4.20.  Typically, Marangoni convec tion suppresses the internal circulation within 
droplets, leading to increased drag coefficients. 
 
Figure 21. Generalised drag curve for droplets (Winnikow and Chao, 1966). 
4.14 Correlations for Mass Transfer Coefficients 
A large number of modelling equations have been reported in the literature for the prediction of the 
internal and external mass transfer coefficients of droplets in an immiscible liquid.  For both 
continuous and dispersed phase re sistances, separate correlating equa tions are generally provided to 
take into account the relevant hydrodynamic behaviour , i.e. for the categories of stagnant, circulating 
and oscillating drops.  For each type of droplet, these correlations genera lly provide a Sherwood 
number in terms of the Reynolds and Schmidt numbe rs, or Peclet number (= Re Sc), and accounting 
for other factors including the viscosity ratio and capillary number.  Kumar and Hartland (1999) 
reviewed the literature and they have summarised a large number of correlations for the dispersed and 
continuous phase coefficients. 
There are various difficulties in choosing an appropri ate correlation.  One major difficulty is that most 
correlations have been based on i nvestigations of non-reactive extr action (e.g. extraction of acetone 
from water to toluene; extraction of acetic acid fr om water to MIBK; etc.), where the level of 
surfactants is low, or else special efforts have been  made to purify the system to avoid surfactants.  In 
the presence of surfactants, including extracting r eagents, the mass transfer coefficients may be 
drastically increased or decreased.  Mass transfer coe fficients are decreased if the surfactants rigidify 
the droplets.  However, the Marangoni effect (as described below in Section 4.20) is also often 
important in reactive mass transfer, and may lead to  a large increase in mass transfer coefficient.  
Another important consideration is that mass transf er coefficients are often defined on the basis of 
isolated droplets.  In a stirred vessel, there ar e important effects due to turbulence (which causes 
droplet deformations and oscillati ons), and break-up and coalescence events.  These effects tend to 
enhance the overall mass transfer coefficient.

  39 4.15 Continuous phase mass transfer coefficient 
Some examples of experimentally-based correlations  for the continuous phase are quoted here.  For 
rigid droplets, Clift et al. (1978) recommended: 
3148.0Sc Re724.01 Shc     for 100 < Re < 2000 and Sc >200.  (42) 
For circulating droplets, Garner et al. (1959) recommended:

For oscillating droplets, Garner and Tayeban (1960) recommended: 
7.0 3ReSc 105.8 50 Shc  (44) 
The correlation of Garner et al . (1959) for circulating droplets was found to be satisfactory in the 
study of the extraction of acetic acid between MIBK and water, as carried out by Temos et. al. (1996). 
However, they also found good agreement with: 
5.060.0Pe Shc   (45) 
Kumar and Hartland (1999) reviewed 10 sources of published data for the continuous phase mass 
transfer coefficient.  As a result they obtained their own empirical equation for the prediction of 
continuous phase mass transfer coefficient for single drops in both circulating and oscillating regimes.  
It is likely that the mass transfer resistance in th e continuous phase can normally be ignored for typical 
solvent extractions of metals (Bart, 2003), sin ce the overall mass transfer coefficient will be 
dominated by the disperse phase resistance.  The or ganic phase is always the more viscous, and the 
organic phase reagent molecules and metal-ligand comp lexes are larger than aqueous ionic species and 
thus have lower diffusivity.  Furthermore, the aqueous  phase is generally fairly well mixed, and in the 
case of a mixer cell, highly turbulent, which redu ces the continuous phase transfer resistance.  
4.16 Dispersed phase mass transfer coefficient 
Many theoretical and empirical equations have also  been developed for the internal, dispersed phase 
side mass transfer coefficient (Kumar and Hartla nd, 1999).  The basis of various equations lies in 
varying assumptions about the prevailing hydrodyna mics and internal circulation.  These have 
included the following (Streicher and Schugerl, 1977): 
 A rigid sphere model (Newman, 1931), where transfer  to the drop interior is only by molecular 
diffusion.  
 Transfer enhanced by laminar internal circulation, e.g. Kronig and Brink (1950). 
 Turbulent motion inside droplet as induced by  oscillations, e.g. Hand los and Baron (1957). 
 Stagnant cap model (Slater, 1995), where due to c oncentration of surface impurities, the lower part 
of the drop is stagnant while the uppe r section has internal circulation.  
 Turbulent diffusion inside droplet related to mass transfer induced surface instabilities (Henschke 
and Pfennig, 1999). 
Schmidt et al . (2006) suggested that in extraction co lumns where droplets are relatively large, 
turbulent mixing can be assumed within the dropl ets and the equation of Handlos and Baron (1957) 
should apply for the dispersed phase mass transfer coefficient.  However, they suggested that in 
mixers, where the specific power input is higher, dr oplets are more likely to be rigid and without 
internal motion.  
  REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  40 In these studies, the mass transfer coefficient has be en derived from an analysis of unsteady diffusion, 
leading to rather complicated expressions which are al so time-dependent.  For example, in the case of 
internal laminar recirculation, Kronig and Brink (19 50) found that the mass transfer coefficient could 
be given by:

where  Bi and i are eigenvalues which can be obtained fro m tables given by Elzinga and Banchero 
(1959).  In studies such as those of Handlos and Baron (1957), and Henschke and Pfennig (1999), this 
equation is modified by replacing the molecular diffu sivity with an effective eddy diffusivity.  The 
expressions may be simplified only in the long term limit, where an asymptotic constant value of 
Sherwood number can be obtained.  This is Sh d = 6.58 for laminar recirculation and Sh d = 17.7 for 
internal turbulence.  
By reviewing 21 sources of published data, Ku mar and Hartland (1999) obtained an empirical 
equation for the prediction of the dispersed phase mass transfer coefficient for single drops, although 
only systems without surfactants were considered.  Their correlation refers to the mass transfer 
coefficient in the long term limit, and was given as:

Application of the time-dependent correlations to s tirred tanks is problematic, since the droplets have a 
distribution of ages and histories, in relation to the residence time distribution in continuous operation.  
Treybal (1981) suggested that the time, t, inserted  in the equation for the ma ss transfer coefficient, 
should be the average residence time in the vesse l, but this would appear to be a very rough 
approximation.  It would seem also that due to  break-up and coalescence, the average exposure time 
for a droplet is considerably shorter than the orga nic phase residence time.  Also, the short exposure 
time of individual droplets would suggest that the average Sherwood number should be higher than the 
long term limit considered by Kumar and Hartland (1999). 
There are other difficulties in applying existing corre lations.  It is problematic that the existing 
correlations are for physical extraction systems, a nd they do not allow for the surfactant effects of 
extracting reagents.  Also, these correlations do not allow for the Marangoni effect.  
In the study of Moerters and Bart (2003), a mathem atical model was set up to describe their moving 
droplet experiments, for the extraction of zinc by D2EPHA.  They tested several proposed expressions 
for mass transfer inside droplets, including those of Slater (1995) and Henschke and Pfennig (1999), 
but found that none of the available equations were reliable over a broad concentration range. 
Yet a further complication, applying to both the cont inuous and dispersed phases, is that mass transfer 
correlations have been developed for the case of tran sfer of a single solute.  In the more general case 
of reactive extraction, and especially with compe titive extraction between different metal ions, multi-
component mass transfer is involved, as discussed fu rther in the next section.  Then, the diffusion of 
each species is affected by the diffusion of all th e other species, and a more sophisticated treatment 
may be necessary.  
In summary, it would seem that available correlations  for mass transfer coefficients remain very 
uncertain in their application, and experimental meas urements of mass transfer coefficients are still

Another consideration in modelling solvent extrac tion is the multi-component nature of the diffusion 
to the interface.  Mass transfer is often treated with the simplest possible approach, namely the 
diffusion of a binary mixture, though diffusion in multi-component mixtures is inherently more 
complex, since the diffusion rate of each individual component is affected by all the other components.  Theoretical developm ents and experimentally based co rrelations, as described above, are 
normally related to relatively simple systems, e.g. the transfer of a single solute between immiscible 
phases, e.g. the transfer of acetic acid from a queous solution to MIBK.  However, in reactive 
extraction there are clearly many more component s in each phase.  Even for the extraction of 
Copper(II) from a pure copper sulfate solution, there is counter current diffusion of Cu
2+ and H+ in the 
aqueous phase, and counter current  diffusion of the extractant HR 2 and complex CuR 2 on the organic 
side.  In a real industrial liquor, there will be other metal species, e.g. Fe(III), Ni(II). 
In multi-component mass transfer, the mass transfer coefficients of each species may be affected by 
the concentrations of the other species.  Only if th e solution is very dilute would the mass transfer 
coefficients be independent.  Furthermore, it is po ssible to have some more unusual diffusion effects 
such as osmotic diffusion (where  there is no concentration gradie nt) or reverse diffusion (in the 
direction contrary to the species’ own concentration gradient). 
Multi-component mass transfer requires the applicat ion of the Maxwell-Stefan equations (Taylor and 
Krishna, 1993), where the diffusion of each species is considered in the presence of the other species 
as a set of simultaneous equations.  For exam ple, in a ternary system with components i = 1– 3, the 
mass flux, J, of components 1 and 2 can be written as: 
2 12 1 11 1 x Dcx Dc Jt t    (48) 
2 22 1 21 2 x Dcx Dc Jt t   (49) 
where the D ij values are the multi-component diffusion coefficients.  Unlike binary systems where the 
diffusivities are fairly constant, the multi-component diffusion coefficients are often a strong function 
of system composition.  In general, for n component s, the equations can be written in a matrix form 
(for n – 1 independent fluxes).  The matrix form le nds itself to more convenient mathematical analysis 
and the generation of suitable algorithms for extracti ng the composition data during mass transfer, etc. 
One possible approach to the application of experi mental correlations in this situation (Taylor and 
Krishna, 1993) is to assume that the form of the correlation is still correct, but to replace the binary 
Fick diffusion coefficient which appears in dimensionless parameters by the matrix of multi-
component diffusion coefficients.  Thus a matrix-bas ed generalisation of a correlation is obtained.  
Another approach would be to obtain the matrix of mass transfer coefficients by experimental 
measurement over a wide range of system compositions.  
The Maxwell-Stefan equations were applied by Moerters and Bart (2003) in modelling of mass 
transfer to a single drop for the Zn(II)-D2EHPA system. 
4.18 Marangoni Effects 
The Marangoni effect is the convection or turbulence wh ich is induced at the interface due to gradients 
of surface tension (Perez de Ortiz, 1992).  Sources of these gradients in solvent extraction include 
variations in solute concentration near the interfa ce and temperature variations due to the heat of 
solution, since the surface tension is a function of these variations.  The effect arises during mass 
transfer under a range of conditions.  Marangoni co nvection can have several important effects: 
 Increase in mass transfer coefficient by up to an order of magnitude; 
 Modification of drag coefficients (higher or lower); 
 Changes in drop coalescence (higher or lower rates). REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  42 Many studies have investigated the conditions und er which interfacial convection develops.  In 
general, it occurs when the surface disturbances set up by a perturbation in surface tension can be 
sustained, and are not dampened out, e.g. by viscosity.  For physical extraction, the relevant 
parameters are the ratio of viscosities between pha ses and the ratio of solute diffusivities between 
phases.  For a given two-phase sy stem, the development of Marangoni  convection then depends on the 
direction of the solute flux.  For example, where the diffusivity of the solute is the same in both phases 
and the solute transfers from the more viscous to the less viscous phase, then interfacial convection is 
sustained.  But if the viscosities are reversed, then  the system is stable and Marangoni convection does 
not develop.  
In reactive solvent extraction, the development of in terfacial convection is more difficult to predict 
and the number of available studies is more limited.   One factor is the surfactant properties of the 
extracting reagent, which may tend to rigidify th e surface.  But Marangoni convection has still been 
observed in various systems, depending on the deta ils of the chemical species, chemical reaction, 
choice of diluents etc.  For example, Nakache et al . (1986) observed interfacial turbulence in the 
extraction of copper by a mixture of di(2-ethylhexy l)phosphoric acid and its sodium salt, in a xylene 
diluent.  However, in the absence of the sodium sa lt, the interface was stable.  In another study, Agble 
et al.  (2000) found that ionic surfactants in fact tended to increase Marangoni convection and thus 
increase the mass transfer rate, whereas neutral surfactants either had no effect or suppressed 
Marangoni convection.  
Interfacial turbulence can have a very significant eff ect on droplet drag coefficients, due to changes in 
the velocity profiles.  Under conditions of sustained interfacial turbulence, drop internal circulation is 
suppressed, and higher drag coefficients are obtained.  
Interfacial turbulence also affects coalescence.  When droplets collide,  the thinning film between them 
is non-uniform in thickness, and the transferring solu te either accumulates or depletes in the narrow 
centre of the film, depending on the direction of tran sfer, thus setting up gradients of surface tension.  
Generally, for transfer out of the droplets, the coal escence rate will be increased, while transfer into 
the droplets leads to decreased coalescence rates. 
4.19 Interfacial Surface Tension 
Information on the interfacial surface tension is im portant in modelling of solvent extraction.  The 
surface tension affects sizes and shapes of droplets , and consequently affects estimates of the drag 
coefficient, mass transfer coefficients etc.  In  reactive solvent extraction,  the extracting reagents 
inevitably exhibit interfacial activity arising from the presence of both polar and non-polar groups.  A preferential orientation of extractant groups take s place at the interface, with the hydrophobic end 
pointed towards the bulk organic phase.  This leads to a lowering of the interfacial tension of the 
diluent.  Thus, the interfacial tension of a pure diluent–water mixture is not a good estimate of the 
actual interfacial tension under process conditions.  Detailed experimental measurements may be 
needed for the surface concentrati on in the presence of varying concentrations of extractant.  
A link between values of interfacial concentrations and interfacial tension may be made by applying 
the Gibbs isotherm equation (Cox,  2004).  According to Baba et al. (2002), the surface pressure (i.e. 
deficit in surface tension due to  surfactant) may be given as: 
])HR[ 1ln(
HRadKSRT  ,  (50) 
where [HR] is the concentration of extractant in the organic phase, K ad is the adsorption constant, 
SHR is the interfacial area per mole of extractant, R is the ideal gas constant and T is temperature.  
However, it may be necessary to account for non-id eality, by using activities of chemical species 
rather than concentrations. REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  43 4.20 Experimental Methods 
4.20.1  Kinetics Measurements 
Various types of experimental apparatus have been  used to study the kinetics of solvent extraction 
processes.  These may involve studies of individual droplets, swarms of droplets, or segregated 
continuous phases.  Typical experimental a pparatus included the following (Danesi, 2004):  
 Highly stirred vessel:  A stirred vessel (Figure 22) is  agitated at a sufficiently high rate that one 
phase is dispersed in the other as  very fine droplets (say about 200 micron).  A transient response is 
analysed by removing samples at different times to  measure concentration.  One difficulty is that 
the total amount of interfacial area is difficult to control.  
 Constant interfacial area stirred cell:  This type of  apparatus is often referred to as a “Lewis cell” 
(Figure 23).  The two phases are individually stirred (usually in opposite directions) while 
maintaining one phase segregated on top of the othe r with a fixed interfacial area, as illustrated in 
Figure 22.  With this apparatus, a plot of extr action rate versus stirring speed may demonstrate a 
plateau region (Bart and Stevens, 2004), where ex traction does not depend on stirring speed, and is 
therefore not diffusion limited (see Figure 24).  Within this region, chemical kinetics can be determined, by sampling of each phase at time interv als.  Great care must be taken to control the 
interface, or else the motion and turbulence of th e liquids near the interface will not be well 
defined.  Devices such as meshes may be included in order to keep the interface flat. 

 Rotating diffusion cell:  The aqueous  and organic phases are brought into contact at the surface of a 
membrane, the pores of which are filled with the or ganic phase.  A rotating cylinder is immersed in 
the aqueous phase.  This allows for well-defined  hydrodynamics in both phases so the diffusional 
processes can be characterised.  A major drawback is in defining or minimising the resistance of 
the membrane.  
 Moving drop apparatus:  A single drop or stream of drops is produced at one end of a vertical tube 
filled with the other phase.  By measuring the tim e of travel, the drop size and the volume of 
collected drops, it is possible to ev aluate the rate of extraction.  A modified method more suited to 
reactive extraction involves inserting a Venturi tube in the column, where by suitable adjustment of 
the counter current flow of the continuous phase, droplets may be held in suspension for an 
arbitrary time (Bart and Stevens, 2004). 
 Short-time phase contact method:  The method is based on measurements of electrical conductivity 
in non-stirred liquid phases.  The phases are initially  kept separate then contacted instantaneously 
with a known contact area.  The change in concen tration is measured through conductometry.  The 
technique relies on an analysis of unsteady diffusion.  
Bart (2003) suggests that experiments with a planar  interface are appropriate for establishing chemical 
kinetics, while mass transfer behaviour is better es tablished using droplets, and may be investigated 
with a Venturi tube apparatus. 
4.20.2  Surface Tension measurements 
Measurements of surface tension may be required sin ce this is an important input to the bubble size 
model, controlling the size for droplet breakage.  Su rface tension is strongly affected by the level of 
absorbed extracting reagent, and therefore measurem ents should be made for different concentrations 
of the extractant in the organic phase.  Brown et al. (2004) recommend the pendant drop technique as 
being more accurate than the du Nüoy ring method.  The apparatus consists of  calibrated syringe with 
a hypodermic needle, which is filled with the denser fluid and a droplet is slowly squeezed out into the REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  44 lighter fluid until the droplet detaches.  With proper calibration, the surface tension can be related to 
the droplet volume, density difference and syringe diameter.

4.20.3  Concentration Measurements 
Moerters and Bart (2000) described the applica tion of fluorescent chemicals in non-invasive 
measurements of mass transfer in reactive extraction.   Measurements can be used with the assistance 
of fluorescent tracers or indicators, whose concentration is measured by means of laser beams and 
optic fibre probes.  A range of possibilities exists fo r the application of fluorescent dyes.  One is to use 
eosine (a fluorescein derivative) in the aqueous phase to indicate H+ gradients.  Calcein in the aqueous 
phase will complex with zinc, indicating zinc co ncentration.  Another method is to extract a 
fluorescing species into the organic phase.  Moerters and Bart (2000) carried out experiments in which 
a rhodamine dye was extracted in the D2EHPA/isododecane/HCl system. 
4.21 Some Specific Studies 
There are a considerable number of studies repor ted in the literature over the years which have 
investigated specific chemical systems.  The mo st commonly studied systems are the zinc-D2EHPA 
system, which has been recommended by the Europ ean Federation of Chemical Engineering as a 
standard test system, and copper extraction with various hydroxyoximes.  Some studies have been 
concerned mainly with elucidating the reaction mech anism, and typically these are carried out with a 
Lewis-type cell, with the aim of avoiding diffusion  limitations.  Other studies attempt to model the 
solvent extraction process incorporating mass transfer .  These include studies of solvent extraction for 
single droplets or overall models of extraction devi ces such as mixers or extraction columns.  
For extraction with a single drop, one approach has been the development of a one-dimensional model 
which allows for radial variations in concentra tions near the interface (Moerters and Bart, 2003).  
There are also CFD studies reported for single drop lets.  There are a number of studies which model 
the solvent extraction process on the larger scale of  a mixer-settler or extraction column.  In such 
cases, the hydrodynamics have generally been treated in a very simplistic way,  such as assuming that 
the mixer cell is fully-mixed (e.g. Komulainen et al., 2006).

Some results from a few recent studies on solven t extraction of copper are outlined here.  
Aminian et al . (2000) outlined a steady-state model for a solvent extraction mixer, in which they 
modelled the competitive extraction of copper(II) a nd iron(III) ions with a hydroxyoxime extractant.  
The overall reactions for copper and iron are:

  H3 FeR HR3 Fe33    (52) 
Both mass diffusion and chemical reaction at the in terface were included in their model.  For mass 
transfer between the bulk and the interf ace, the equations for extracted species i and hydrogen ion to 
or from the bulk aqueous phase were given as:

  46 where r is rate per unit area, k is the mass transfer coefficient and x is the concentration in the aqueous 
phase.  For transfer of extracted species and extr acting reagent on the organic side of interface the 
equations are: 
int

int

where y is the concentration in the organic phase.  A chemical rate expression  was developed taking 
into account forward and reverse rates of reaction and based on an assumption of partial reaction 
orders of one.  The rate of chemical reaction at the surface (per unit interfacial area) was given by:

Since this was a steady-state model, the rates of transf er to each side of the interface and the rates of 
chemical reaction at the interface were all assumed equal.  
The equilibrium constant, mass transfer coefficients  and the forward and reve rse rate constants were 
estimated from laboratory tests and plant sampling, as described in the thesis of Aminian.  The steady-
state model was calibrated for plant conditions of 1.96 g/L copper and 8.54 g/L iron in the feed leach 
solution and a pH of 1.78. 
The values adopted in their model for the mass transfer coefficients were k Cu = 3.7710-3 cm/s; k Fe = 
6.1410-4 cm/s; k FeR3 = 3.03E10-3 cm/s.  For the chemical reactions, the chemical rate constants were 
kr,Cu = 4.110-1 cm/s and k r,Fe = 5.8 10-3 cm/s.  The simulations predicted that iron will only be 
marginally extracted and this was confirmed in pilot plant trials.  
Zhang et al . (2002) investigated the kinetics of reactive extraction of Cu2+ by the hydroxyoxime 
Acorga P50.  They used a method called MEMED (micro-electrochemical measurement at expanding 
droplets) in which a very fine electrode is used to  measure the developing concentration profile of the 
copper ion near the droplet surface.  By solving th e convection-diffusion equa tion, conclusions can be 
made about the rate and mechanism of the extraction process.  They found that the reaction occurs at 
the interface between phases.  In their proposed m echanism, the oxime migrates to the interface and 
dissociation to H+ and L- occurs.  The copper is then successively complexed as CuL- then CuL 2.  The 
addition of the first ligand to Cu2+ was found to be rate limiting.  They proposed a kinetic rate law 
which is first order in Cu2+, first order in oxime, and inverse first order in H+, according to: 
]H[]HL][ Cu[ ] Cu[2 2
 
  kdtd  (58) 
and the calculated rate constant was k = 1.2 x 10-4 cm s-1.  
Baba et al.  (2002) studied the extraction of Cu2+ with 2-hydroxy-4- n-octyloxybenzophenone, which 
was a new hydroxyoxime synthesised to perform sel ective extraction of copper in the presence of 
nickel(II) and cobalt(II).  They measured the extr action rate of copper with the hydroxyoxime in 
toluene, in a stirred transfer cell.  They found that the rate limiting step was the reaction between 
adsorbed monomeric ligand and copper ion at the interface; however, diffusion of the copper ion from 
the bulk of the aqueous phase to the interface was also important.  They proposed that the overall 
extraction rate could be given by:

  47 where N is the specific molar extraction rate (mol cm-2 s-1), CCu is the total aqueous phase copper 
concentration, and kCu2+ is the aqueous phase mass transfer coefficient, which was estimated to have a 
value of 3.2x 10-4 cm s-1 in a stirred Lewis-type cell. 
A dynamic computer model was reported by Komulainen et al.  (2006).  The mixer was treated as a 
‘black box’ and complete internal mixing was assume d.  For the mixer unit, they derived an overall 
mass transfer coefficient based on actual plant meas urements of inlet and outlet concentrations in 
copper extraction.  They obtained values between 50 and 400 l/s for Kc (mass transfer coefficient 
based on continuous phase).  This can be compared with a value of Kc = 25 l/s reported by Ingham et 
al. (1994).  
4.22 Inputs for a CFD Model and concluding remarks 
This review has highlighted the significant features which characterise metallu rgical solvent extraction 
systems, and has provided a guideline as to what empi rical data will be of importance in developing a 
CFD simulation method which incorporates mass transf er.  Some of this data may be available from 
the literature or from various databases.  For other data, it will be necessary to characterise the system 
of interest by experimental measurements.  The empirical inputs needed for a CFD model may include 
the following: 
 Basic property data including densities, viscosities and molecular diffusivities. 
 Equilibrium constants, distribution coe fficients and adsorption constants.   
 Interfacial tension, as a function of extr actant concentration in the organic phase. 
 Chemical rate mechanisms a nd kinetic rate constants.  
 Mass transfer coefficients. 
 Data on droplet sizes, with which to calibrate a population balance model. 
To provide these data, possible experimental techniques may include the following: 
 Equilibria can be determined by usual shaker flasks followed by chemical analysis. 
 The Lewis-type cell can be used for measuring ch emical kinetics, under conditions which eliminate 
diffusion limitations. 
 Since the mass transfer process is  likely to be sensitive to factor s such as breakup/coalescence of 
droplets and the influence of turbulence, it would be  best to measure mass transfer in an actual 
stirred vessel, for known chemical kinetics, and si multaneous measurement of the interfacial area.  
 The pendant drop method should be used to measure surface tension.  
 Drop sizes could be measured by an extraction technique or by photographic means.  
Many properties are functions of the solute concen trations and the specific system composition, and 
should be determined over a range of  conditions.  The mass transfer coefficient, in particular, is 
sensitive to a range of factors and should be measured over a range of conditions.  
The largest amount of literature data and previous modelling studies refer to the zinc-D2EHPA system 
or various copper-hydroxyoxime systems.  Therefor e, it would be advisable to choose one of these 
systems as a starting point for modelling development. 
This literature survey was undertaken to assist with the development of a model for mass transfer in a 
CFD model of a mixer cell representative of a meta llurgical solvent extraction unit.  The review 
indicated the modelling method must allow for bot h physical mass transfer between phases and 
chemical reactions between the extracting reagent a nd the metal species in aqueous solution.  Either REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  48 the physical or chemical mechanisms or both may control the overall rate of extraction, depending on 
the operating conditions.  The chemical reaction us ually occurs at the interface and a number of 
elementary steps are involved, of which one or more  may be rate controlling.  Determination of the 
rate law involves various ambiguities, which can be resolved to some extent by measurement of the 
extraction rate over a wide range of condition s.  In modelling mass transfer, the droplet 
hydrodynamics must be considered.  A large numbe r of correlations for mass transfer coefficients 
have been proposed, but it is uncertain as to th eir appropriateness in stirred vessels.  Complicating 
factors in predicting the mass transfer include the effects of turbulence, break-up and coalescence of 
droplets, and the Marangoni effect.  
Previous efforts in modelling solvent extraction have  been reviewed, including some of the typically 
assumed chemical reaction schemes, equations for the chemical kinetics, and the application of 
various correlations for the mass transfer rate.  It  is clear that in the development of a modelling 
method, various experimental inputs will be needed .  Experimental methods have been reviewed 
which are relevant to measuring the intrinsic reaction rate, the interfacial mass transfer rate, and other 
characteristics of the extraction system.  A numb er of experimental procedures have been 
recommended to provide data to support the devel opment of the computational model.  For the 
purposes of validation of SXT2 capabilities and th e modelling methodology it was decided that the 
focus would be initially on the extraction of copper using hydroxyoximes, since this is the type of 
system for which the greatest amount of information is available in the literature. REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  49 5. SUMMARY OF MASS TRANSFER AND KINETIC 
MEASUREMENTS, ENTRAINM ENT AND NEW EQUIPMENT 
DEVELOPMENTS 
As described above the inclusion of mass transfer into the CFD models of the mixer or mixing of the 
two phases in a solvent extraction contactor is e ssential to convert the CFD model into one of a 
solvent extraction process rather than just a fl uid flow model.  Taking the mathematics being 
established the validation of the rates of extrac tion under differing conditions for a standard system 
was critical to development of confidence in the model and its subsequent  use for the study of 
extraction under other conditions (e.g. temperature, concentrations, pH, redox,  phase ratio etc) or 
indeed the study of other systems.  As mentioned earlier a CSIRO designed “Lewis Cell” was 
constructed, commissioned and with an on-line anal ytical capability put into use in this study. 
5.1 Preliminary kinetic test s using a batch mixer 
Initial preliminary kinetic tests were performed in a batch mixe r (80mm L x 80mm W x 120mm H) 
with 4 baffles using an overhead stirrer with Ф40 mm impeller over a pH range of 0.9-1.8 and stirring 
speeds of 900-1500 rpm at 30 °C.  
The rate of copper extraction with the organic sy stem containing 10% LIX984 in Shellsol D70 was 
high in the pH range and stirring speed tested, which made the sampling for kinetic measurement 
difficult.  A ‘critical’ speed of 900 rpm or 1.9 m/s at  pH ~0.9 was established at which the two phases 
were almost completely mixed by visual observation. 
The drop size distribution in the mixer was measured at stirring speed in the range of 710 – 1790 rpm 
using a Lasentec Particle Vision Measurement (PVM) probe.  It was observed that the droplet sizes 
tended to decrease as the stirring speed increased; however, more air bubbles were introduced into the 
system.  At 710 rpm, it was evident that more droplet s tended to stick to the probe window.  This data 
was provided for incorporation into the CFD model. 
5.2 Review of techniques for mass tr ansfer and kinetic measurements 
Solvent extraction fundamentals and various techniqu es for mass transfer and kinetic measurement 
were reviewed to compare and select techniques fo r further development.  Solvent extraction involves 
multi-steps of diffusion and chemical reactions.  For kinetic studies, it is important to identify the 
extraction regimes, the location of the reaction, ra te limiting step and kinetic reaction mechanism.  
Various techniques and apparatus have been develope d for mass transfer and kinetic measurement.  
The techniques can be classified into three major categories:  
1. Highly stirred tanks.  This is the most commonly adopted technique in metallurgical laboratories 
due to its similarity to practical solvent extracti on mixers, and the use of simple equipment which is 
readily available in a laboratory.  However, hy drodynamic conditions are not well defined in terms 
of droplet size and interfacial area.  In fact, the coalescence among the fine droplets limits the 
droplets size as the stirring rate is increased beyo nd a critical value.  Therefore, the unequivocal 
information on the extraction regime ca nnot be derived using this technique. 
2. Constant interfacial area stirred cells (e.g. Lewis Cell).  This technique features a definite known 
interfacial contact area capable of distinguish ing bulk reaction from interfacial reaction and 
establishing extraction regimes.  Good reproducibility is expected and can be proven from different 
interfacial areas under well defi ned hydrodynamic conditions.  Howe ver, it is difficult in the 
original Lewis cell design to maintain constant interfacial area under turbulent flow.  Modified 
Lewis cells reported included internal baffles, cyli nders and grids to improve their performance.   REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  50 3. Moving drops.  This simple technique is designed to simulate a dispersed single droplet moving in 
a continuous phase for mass transfer and reacti on.  However, it is difficult to control the 
hydrodynamics of moving drops, to establish the ex traction regime due to the uncertainty of the 
degree of turbulence of the two phases, and to interpret the data. 
The Lewis cell with a constant interfacial area has mo re advantages than other techniques in terms of 
kinetic measurement and was selected fo r further development in this project. 
5.3 Design and construction of the CSIRO Lewis cell 
Based on the principles of solvent extraction ki netics, an improved Lewis cell was designed and 
constructed at CSIRO Waterford with the following features (Figures 25): 
 Curved horizontal and vertical baffles with holes and cylindrical grid to minimise vortex, rippling 
and disturbance on the interface under turbulent flows. 
 Dual shafts to enable impellers in the aqueous phase and the organic phase to rotate in opposite 
directions, with separate controls  for various speed combinations. 
 Two 45° pitched blade turbines to allow balanced axial and radial flow components and the change 
of flow directions. 
 Ring baffles of different sizes to enable the variation of the interfacial areas. 
 Water jacket for circulating external water to ma intain constant temperatures during the kinetic 
measurement. 
 Designed for easy continuous pH monitoring and control. 
 Designed for easy sampling and continuous on-line analysis. 
 Clear cell body for visual observations.  
The initial prototype of the improved Lewis cell used  a cylindrical body of acrylic; however, it was 
found that the material was not sufficiently durable when in contact with the organic solutions.  The 
cell body was later replaced by double cylinders of Purex glass, enabling fast heat exchange through 
the water jacket to maintain constant temperature during the tests.

  51 5.4 Validation of the CSIRO Lewis cell 
The organic system of 10% (v/v) LIX 984N in Shells ol D70 and a synthetic aqueous solution of 2 g/L 
Cu were used for initial validation of the CSIRO Lewis cell.  Three distinct zones of the extraction rate 
were obtained as a function of stirring speed at two temperatures (Figure 26):  
Zone (A) features a linear increase of the copper extr action rate with stirring rate, clearly attributable 
to the decreasing thickness of the stagnant diffusion layers in a diffusion regime. 
Zone B shows a plateau of the copper extraction ra te, being independent of the stirring rate and 
suggesting a change from diffusi on regime to kinetic regime. 
Zone C shows a sharp increase in the copper extrac tion rate, evidently resulting from the disturbance 
of the interfacial area at even higher stirring rates. 
In Zone B, the corresponding Reynolds numbers we re estimated to be in the range of 4000-7000 for 
the organic phase and 8000-15,000 for the aqueous phase .  These results have demonstrated that the 
Lewis cell works well in terms of maintaining the c onstant interfacial area under turbulent flows for 
the determination of extraction regimes.

5.5 Kinetics measurements us ing the CSIRO Lewis cell 
The kinetics of the copper extraction with LIX984N in Shellsol D70 were measured using the CSIRO 
Lewis cell.  At a fixed stirring speed in Zone B (kinetic regime), the copper extraction rate was 
proportional to the interfacial areas (Figure 27).  It was evident that the slowes t step for the extraction 
reaction was occurring at the interface or in the interfacial zones.  The empirical rate equation 
established in the pH range of 0.4-1.8, 0.1-0.5 g/L Cu and 0.1-5% LIX 984N can be expressed by:

  53 6. BRIEF REVIEW ON ENTRAINMENT IN SOLVENT 
EXTRACTION PROCESSES 
Entrainment is a critical issue in the control of operating costs associated with the operation of any 
solvent extraction plant.  While well operated so lvent extraction plants can maintain entrainment 
levels in the low parts per million (ppm), process excursions and interruptions often lead to many 
hundreds or thousands of ppm entrainment.  Opera ting at these higher levels of entrainment is 
expensive and worrisome over longer peri ods and would require remedial action. 
A review of entrainment in solvent extraction wa s carried out to illustrate and better develop an 
understanding of the factors, effects, measurement me thods and issues associated with entrainment in 
real operations; the findings are briefly reviewed in  this section.  In a ddition to volatilisation and 
degradation of organic reagents, physical entrainm ent and chemical dissolution are two of the main 
causes of losses in solvent extraction.  Organi c entrainment and dissolution in aqueous raffinate 
leaving the solvent extraction circuit will result in pe rmanent losses if not recovered.  The main factors 
which contributed to the entrainment include low temp erature, reagent degradation, high flow rates, 
poor mixer/settler design, slow or fast phase separation, and composition of leach solutions. 
Entrainment and dissolution in solvent extraction coul d not only cause severe losses of the reagents, 
but also direct and indirect detrimental effect s on both downstream and upstream processing.  There 
are four main streams of different types of entrainment identified (Figure 28): 
Stream (1): Organic entrainment in the raffina te contributing to the major organic lose and 
inefficiency of the solvent extraction operations. 
Stream (2): Aqueous entrainment in the loaded organic causing metal impurity transfer to 
electrowinning (EW) and a vicious circle of the organic degradation by oxidising 
metals generated at anodes. 
Stream (3):  Organic entrainment in the loaded strip liquor causing low current efficiency and poor 
quality of the cathode products in some cases.   
Stream (4): Aqueous (a high acidity electrolyte) entrainment in the stripped organic causing extra 
consumption of base reagents if neutralise d and inefficiency of the solvent extraction 
operations.

Entrainment control in many plants has not been  sufficiently practiced.  In some operations, the 
organic losses are measured merely by the consumpt ion of the new organic components required to be 
added to an operating circuit on an annual basis.   The relevant issues are identified as follows: 
(i) Location and frequency of sampling for monitoring the entrainment. (ii) Approaches to collect representative samples for measurement. 
(iii) Methods for accurate and precise measurement of the entrainment. EX SC STAQ Feed

sample storage, ageing effects, sub-sampling and an alytical or measurement technique, its calibration, 
and validation is to be studied and reported on  elsewhere.  A longer term goal would be the 
development of cost effective, automated and on-line (real time) determination of entrainment 
measures for both organic in aqueous and aqueou s in organic with equipment robust enough for 
application in metallurgical operations.

  55 7. STUDY OF COPPER EXTRACTION  KINETICS WITH LIX 984N 
USING A CSIRO LEWIS CELL 
An understanding of the kinetics of mass transfer wi thin the mixer section of a solvent extraction unit 
is critical to the design and operation of the unit for op timal extraction or stripping of the target metals.  
Without such mass transfer happening with the appr opriate efficiency and selectivity the separation 
process would be less effective, bringing with it a ll the easily anticipated potential consequences.  
Additionally kinetic measurements  are important for understanding th e relevant reaction mechanism 
and establishing rate models which can be inco rporated into mathematical models such as 
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models (Bart 2001; Danesi 2004; Zhu et al. 2008). 
Within our research scope we had previous perfo rmed preliminary tests and measurements of the 
kinetics of copper extraction using a stirred tank were over a range of in itial pH’s (0.9-1.8) and stirring 
speeds (900-1500 rpm) at 30 °C.  This initial test work  was carried out without pH control in a bench 
top mixing box fitted with 4 baffles and using an overhead stirrer with Ф40 mm impeller.  The rate of 
copper extraction is very high in the pH range and st irring speed considered in these tests, this made 
sampling for the kinetic measurement difficult.  A ‘critical’ speed of 900 rpm or 1.9 m/s was 
established at which the two phases were complete ly mixed at pH ~0.9.  Although the rate of 
extraction using the stirred tank under the experime ntal conditions was similar to that found in 
practical applications, it is difficult to quantitatively control and measure the interfacial area to derive 
unequivocal information relating to the rate determining step. 
The Lewis cell features well controlled and reproduc ible hydrodynamic cond itions with a constant 
interfacial area.  However, one of the difficulties with the original Lewis cell design was maintaining a 
constant interfacial area under turbulent conditi ons.  A modified Lewis cell was designed and 
constructed by the solvent extraction technology group at CSIRO, including several sophisticated 
features and advantages that enable kinetic studi es, which have been disc ussed elsewhere in this 
report.  
This section of the report covers  the findings of a preliminary study of the kinetics of copper 
extraction with LIX 984N in Shellsol D70 carried  out using the CSIRO Lewis cell.  The primary 
objectives of the study were to characterise the new Lewis cell, verify the method for undertaking 
kinetic measurement and identify the key kinetic features of copper extraction with the LIX 984N 
organic system. 
7.1 Principles of extraction kinetics 
In studying the kinetics of a solvent extraction pro cess it is important to establish the nature of the 
extraction regime: “diffusion controlled regime” or “kinetically controlled regime”, and to further 
identify the rate limiting step in the kinetic regime .  The mass transfer process in solvent extraction 
involves multi-steps of diffusion and chemical reacti ons.  Considering two film theory, it is assumed 
that there would be a stagnant layer immediately adjacent to the interface on each side of the organic 
(δorg) and aqueous phases ( δaq), which is termed as the interfacial zone as presented in Figure 29.  The 
actual “extraction reaction” could occur at one or mo re of the five locations: at the interface by an 
adsorption mechanism, at either stagnant layer and at  either bulk phase.  In any case, one or more of 
the reactants has to diffuse through the stagnant laye r to the reaction sites for the extraction reaction to 
occur.  Then the reaction product has to diffuse away from the reaction sites to the respective bulk 
phase.  If the reaction occurs in the bulk phases, th e reaction is homogeneous whereas if it occurs at 
the interface by an adsorption mechanism, it is he terogeneous.  At a constant interfacial area, as 
obtained in a Lewis cell, the thicknesses of the stagna nt layers are an approximately linear function of 
stirring speed until the thickness reaches  its lower limit.  Above this speed, the extraction rate becomes 
constant and independent of stirring speed.  The extraction is expected to be in the kinetically REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  56 controlled regime as the resistance offered by the diff usion through the stagnant player is so small that 
it can be neglected.  Other criteria such as the activ ation energy can also provide useful information 
for identification of the extraction regimes.

7.2 Experimental 
7.2.1 Equipment 
The CSIRO Lewis cell was used in this study (see Figure 30 and Figure 25 for a closer view of the 
internals).  The initial prototype of the Lewis cell used a cylindrical body of acrylic; however, it was 
found that the material was not durable enough when in  contact with the organic solutions.  The cell 
body has been replaced by double cylinders of Pure x glass, enabling fast heat exchange through the 
water jacket to maintain constant temperature dur ing the tests.  The hot water was supplied from a 
Julabo water bath circulator.  The solution temper ature and pH were continuously monitored by a 
temperature probe and a thermo pH probe connected  to a Hanna HI 9025C pH meter with internal 
temperature compensation.  An on-line UV-Vis m onitoring system consisting of an Agilent G1315A

  57 7.2.2 Materials 
Copper stock solution of 20 g/L concentration was made by dissolving AR grade copper sulphate in 
distilled water.  A feed solution for each test was d iluted from the stock solution  with distilled water. 
LIX 984N was used after pre-treatment with 180 g/L H 2SO 4 and washed with distilled water to 
remove impurities.  The working organic solutions we re made by dissolving the treated LIX® 984N in 
Shellsol D70 diluent. 
7.2.3 Method 
For each test, 830 mL of aqueous solution was charged into the cell using a conical glass funnel with a 
long end reaching the bottom of the cell to avoid to uching the upper wall of the cell and the internal 
fittings where the organic solution is accommodated.   The same volume of the organic solution was 
gently and slowly transferred on the top of the a queous phase to minimise any disturbance at the 
interface.   
7.2.4 Sampling and analysis 
In this study, the organic phase was continuously  sampled by the Gilson peristaltic pump flowing 
through a 1-mm flow cell for detecting the absorbance by the copper complex at 672 nm.  The 
absorbance values were then converted to copper co ncentrations against the calibrations established 
with a series of known copper loaded organic solu tions.  For verification of the accuracy of the on-line 
colorimetric method, liquid samples of 2 mL each we re taken at regular intervals and filtered through 
a 0.45µm membrane filter for assay using Inductiv ely Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy 
(ICP-AES).  Organic samples were al so taken and stripped with 180 g/L H 2SO 4 at 40 °C followed by 
filtration of the strip liquor through the 0.45µm memb rane filter before analys is using ICP-AES.  In 
most cases, the rates obtained by the two analytical  methods were in good agreement, demonstrating 
that both methods are reliable and can be used in to  determine solvent extraction kinetic studies with 
the Lewis cell. 
 
7.3 Results and Discussions 
7.3.1 Effect of stirring speed 
Plots of copper extraction against ti me at 20 °C and pH 1.8 using 2 g/ L Cu in the aqueous solution and 
10% (v/v) LIX 984N in Shellsol D70 are shown in Figure 31.  All the plots are linear over the 30 
minute operating window, indicating pseudo-zero or der kinetics, since the change in copper 
concentration in the aqueous phase is low.  The in itial rates of extraction obtained from the slope were 
plotted versus the stirring speed, as shown in Figure 32.  The plot is characterised by three distinct 
zones, and a transition between Zone A and Zone B. 
In Zone A, the rate of copper extraction increases linearly with stirring speed up to 80 rpm.  Clearly, 
the linear increase in the rate of copper extraction c ould be attributed to the reduction of the thickness 
of the stagnant diffusion layers, which is characterised as a diffusion controlled regime. 
In Zone B, the rate of copper extraction became inde pendent of the stirring speed in the range of  
80-180 rpm.  It is expected that as the stirring sp eed further increases, the reduction of the thickness of 
the stagnant layers reached such limiting values that the diffusion rate is sufficiently faster than the 
chemical reaction rate, suggesting a change from the diffusion controlled regime to the kinetically 
controlled regime. 
In Zone C, the rate of copper extraction dramatical ly increased at the stirring speed above 200 rpm.  
Some disturbances at the interface were visually ob served.  Evidently, the sh arp increase in the rate 
was caused by the increased interfacial  area resulting from the disturbances. REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  58 In order to investigate the effect of temperature on the extraction regimes, tests were performed at 
30 °C and the results are compared in Figure 32.  The rates at 30 °C were remarkably higher than those at 20 °C in all the zones and the zone borders  are similar to those divided for 20 °C except for 
Zone A, where the diffusion zone is extended from 60 rpm to 100 rpm.  
In the stirring speed range of 100-180 rpm, the corresponding Reynolds numbers were estimated to be 
in the range of 4000-7000 for the organic phase and 8000-15,000 for the aqueous phase.  Based on 
Sinnott (2007), the Reynolds number for fully turbulent flows in a stirred cylindrical tank is about 
10,000.  Since the two phases were stirred in oppo site directions, the total effect occurring at the 
interface should be the sum of the two phase flows.  These results demonstrated that the Lewis cell 
worked well in terms of maintaining consta nt interfacial area under turbulent flows. 
To assess the diffusion resistance in the indivi dual phases, the rates of copper extraction were 
measured by varying the stirring speed in one phase wh ile it was set constant in the other.  At a fixed 
stirring speed of 150 rpm in the aqueous phase, an in crease in the stirring speed in the organic phase 
from 100 to 150 rpm resulted in a small increase in the extraction rate (Figure 33).  In comparison, the 
same increase in the stirring speed in the aqueous  phase at a fixed 150 rpm in the organic phase 
resulted in about 28% increase in the extraction rate.  This suggests that some re sistance may lie in the 
interfacial zone of the aqueous side.

7.3.2 Effect of interfacial area 
Several horizontal ring baffles with different diamet ers were designed and constructed to enable the 
effect of the interfacial area on the rate of extraction to be examined.  Figure 34 shows the rate of 
copper extraction as a function of the interfacial ar ea at pH 1.8 and 30 °C with a stirring speed of 
150 rpm for both phases.  The organic system c ontaining 10% LIX 984N in Shellsol D70 and the 
aqueous solution contained 2 g/L Cu.  The rate of copper extraction increased linearly with increasing 
interfacial area.  This strongly suggests that the extraction occurs in the interfacial zones.

7.3.3 Effect of temperature 
The effect of temperature on the rate of copper extr action was examined in the range of 15 – 50 °C at 
pH 1.8 with a fixed stirring speed of 150 rpm using the feed solution containing 2 g/L Cu and the 
organic system containing 10% LIX 984N in She llsol D70.  The rates of copper extraction 
significantly increased with increasing temperatures (Figure 35).  
For estimation of the apparent activation energy (Ea), the Arrhenius equation is employed as in 
Equation (66): 
Lnk = lnA – Ea/RT (66) 
where k is the rate constant, A the frequency factor and R = 8.3145 J/K/mol.

  60 Plotting of Ln k versus 1/T should give a straight line with the slope value equal to – Ea/R.  As shown 
in Figure 36, the plot shows two linear ranges which meet at ca. 30 °C: 
 In the range of 15 – 30°C, Ea = 67 kJ/mol  
 In the range of 30 – 50°C, Ea = 25 kJ/mol  
In a diffusion regime, the apparent activation energy is usually in the range of 8-10 kJ/mol while in 
kinetic regime, it is expected above 40 kJ/mol, a nd the values between suggest a transient regime 
(Tarasov, and Yagodin 2001).  Therefore, the measured apparent E a = 67 kJ/mol in the range of 30-
50 °C is expected for extraction which is in  the kinetically controlled regime, while E a = 25 kJ/mol 
over the range of 15-30 °C is consistent with the transient regime.  However, conclusions could only 
be made by taking into the c onsideration other dependencies.

7.3.4 Effect of pH 
The rate of copper extraction strongly depended on th e pH (Figure 37).  The plot in Figure 38 shows 
that the rate of copper extraction is approxima tely first order with respect to hydrogen ion  
concentration [H+] in the pH range of 0.4-1.8.  In the pH ra nge of 1.8-2.8, the rate of copper extraction 
tended to be less dependent on the pH .  Accordingly, the reaction order is reduced to about half order 
with respect to the concentration of hydrogen ions. 0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.0

7.3.5 Effect of Cu concentration 
In the range of 0.1-0.5 g/L Cu, the rate of coppe r extraction strongly depended on the concentration 
(Figure 39), approximating to first order rate with respect to the copper concentration (Figure 40) at 
less than 1 g/L Cu. In the range of 1-8 g/L Cu, the order of the dependency decreased to about 0.4.  
This may indicate a change in the rate limiting step and chemical species at higher copper concentrations.

The rate of copper extraction increased with the concentration of LIX 984N up to 5% (Figure 41).  
This was corresponding to a first order dependence with respect to the concentration of LIX 984N 
(Figure 42).  At higher LIX 984N concentrations (5-10%  (v/v)), the rates tended to be independent of 
the concentration of LIX 984N.

  63 8. MODELLING OF INTERPHASE MASS TRANSFER IN SOLVENT 
EXTRACTION MIXERS 
8.1 Modelling of the Extraction Kinetics 
A literature review was undertaken earlier in the SXT project (see Lane, 2008), which provided a basis 
for understanding of the chemistry and rate-controlling mechanisms in hydrometallurgical solvent 
extraction processes.  These processes generally in volve ‘reactive’ solvent extraction, meaning that 
extraction is achieved by reagents which are activ e at or near the interface between droplets and 
continuous phase.  Modelling of this type of pro cess must allow for a multistep extraction rate scheme 
including: 
 Ion dissociation, chelate formation etc. near the interface; 
 Mass transfer through resistive films at interface. 
 
The modelling development has been limited so far to extraction of copper into a 
hydroxyoxime/kerosene mixture (see Figure 43 for a typical copper-hydroxyoxime structure).  
Various analyses of the extraction mechanism have been published in the literature (see Lane, 2008).  
By reviewing the proposals of various authors, it was decided to implement a scheme which follows 
Zhang et al. (2002). 
Following Zhang et al., the overall chemical reaction is given by: 
2
2 Cu 2HL CuL 2H   (67) 
Here, copper ion, Cu2+, in the aqueous phase reacts with hydroxyoxime extractant, HL, in the organic 
phase (indicated by an overbar) to give a copper-h ydroxyoxime ligand complex in the organic phase, 
CuL 2, accompanied by the release of hydr ogen ions in the aqueous phase.  
The reaction is assumed to occur near the interface.   This requires that species in the bulk of each 
phase must diffuse through the aqueous or or ganic boundary layers to the interface.  The 
hydroxyoxime molecule must dissoci ate to produce a charged anion (L-), and the copper ion must 
become chelated by two of these anions in or der to make it soluble in the organic phase.

The mechanism here is based on the assumption that  the aqueous phase is continuous.  Diffusion to 
the interface on the continuous (aqueous) side is assu med fast, so aqueous species concentrations in 
the bulk of the aqueous and at the interface are assume d equal.  On the organic side, it is assumed that 
the dissociation of the extractant is governed by equilibrium, while the diffusion of chelated copper 
complex is mass transfer controlled.

  64 Following Zhang et al. (2002), the rate-controlling reaction step is proposed to be: 
2C u () L () C u L () ii i   (68) 
with forward and reverse rates kf and kr and an equilibrium constant given by K ex.  The subscript  i 
indicates species at the interface.  
The interfacial concentration of L- is related to the concentration of  HL in terms of an equilibrium 
constant for dissociation, K1.  The dissociation reaction is: 
H L () H () L () ii i  (69) 
The concentration of HL at the interface is assumed to  be the same as in the bulk of the organic phase.  
The attachment of the second ligand is assumed fa st, after which the copper complex diffuses away 
from the interface with a mass flux given by: 
[HL][HL] [HL]i
db idkAdt   (70) 
where kd is the organic side mass transfer coefficient and A is the interfacial area.  
It is assumed that reaction rate and mass flux of complex are locally and instantaneously equal, which 
allows for the unknown concentration of CuL+ to be eliminated.  Therefore, the extraction rate can be 
expressed in terms of concentrati ons in the bulk of the phases only. 
The final form of the rate equation is:

Note that if the reverse reaction term (second term on RHS) is neglected (for final extraction 
approaching 100%), then this equation reduces to one very similar that was used in the earlier 
modelling (Lane et al., 2008).  
This rate equation has been used to model the extrac tion rate in the Waterford mixer.  As well as the 
properties of the materials, the m odel requires the following inputs: 
 Forward reaction rate constant, kf;  
 Extraction equilibrium constant, K1; 
 Dissociation equilibrium constant, Kex; 
 Sauter mean diameter, d32. 
Values of these constants were set based on r ecommendations from the literature, and are listed in 
Table 2.  Additionally, the mass transfer coefficien t on the organic side was calculated according to

where d is the droplet size and D is the diffusivity coefficient.  The value of kd was calculated as the 
long term limiting value of this equation.  For example, for a 300 micron drop, the mass transfer 
coefficient is estimated as 1.3 x 10-5 m/s.

8.2 The Computation Fluid Dynamic (CFD) Method 
CFD modelling was applied to simulate the CSIRO (Wat erford) mixer cell.  The mixer cell is a square 
box of side length 80 mm with baffles on each side  wall, and is agitated by a 40 mm diameter six-
bladed impeller.  A finite volume mesh was genera ted to represent the mixer geometry (see Figures 43 
and 44) and the impellor (see Figure 45) with about 540,000 nodes.  Using this mesh, the flow field in 
the mixer was simulated by obtaining a solution to  the Eulerian-Eulerian equations for two-phase 
flow.  The impeller rotation was accounted for using the Multiple Frames of Reference method (MFR), where the flow is calculated with th e impeller in one fixed position, and the region 
surrounding the impeller is taken as be ing in a rotating frame of refere nce.  The work was carried out 
using the ANSYS-CFX 11 software.  Further details of the CFD method can be found in the previous 
report (Lane et al.,  2008). 
The droplet size distribution of the organic phase  was modelled using a pop ulation balance equation 
approach, implemented in the CFX software as the ‘MUSIG’ model.  This modelling method predicts 
droplet sizes taking into account rates of break-up an d coalescence.  The droplet size predictions here 
are based on the same method as developed for the Cl ayton physical model, and further details of the 
population balance equations can be found in another report (Lane, 2010).  
Modelling of the copper extraction rate was based on  the solution of additiona l conservation equations 
for the mass fractions of chemical species in the or ganic and aqueous phases.  The additional variables 
represent the following species: 
H
+(aq)   –  hydrogen ion in the aqueous phase; 
Cu2+(aq)  –  copper ion in the aqueous phase; 
HL(o)    –  hydroxyoxime molecule in the organic phase; CuL
2(o) –  chelated copper complex in the organic phase. 
Source terms were specified in each species equa tion, accounting for the rate of reaction and the 
number of moles of each species in the reaction.  
The reaction rate was calculated in a time-stepping manner based on a frozen velocity field.  The CFD 
model provides an input in terms of the predicted Sauter mean diameter.  
Simulations were carried out for a range of opera ting conditions with varying impeller speed and pH 
for extraction, corresponding to experimental m easurements carried out at Waterford, which 
investigated the extraction rate of copper by the ex tractant LIX984N (diluted to 10% in Shellsol D70).  REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY

8.3 Results 
Simulations of copper extraction were completed for pH of 0.9 and 1.8 at a constant impeller speed 
(900 rpm), and for impeller speeds of 900, 1300 and 1500 rpm, at constant pH of 0.9.  The extraction 
rates according to modelling and measurements are s hown in Figures 46 and 47.  It can be seen that 
the simulations provide a good match to the experiment s.  It can be seen from these results that the 
effect of increasing pH is to increase extraction rate as well as increasing the extent of extraction.  The 
effect of increasing speed is to increase extraction rate, which is related mainly to the reduction in 
droplet size (and increase in interfacial area).

8.4 Conclusion 
CFD modelling of a solvent extraction mixer box h as been extended to include simulation of the 
extraction rate for a copper-hydroxyoxime system, and good agreement has been demonstrated in 
comparison with measurements over a range of impelle r speeds and pH.  This provides a good basis to 
use the model in simulating other solvent extraction mixers, so as to assess alternative configurations 
in terms of extraction rate.  The method could also assist in scale-up of these mixers.  
However, the method is still fairly limited in its ra nge of applicability.  So far, the model has only 
been tested for extraction conditions.  This shoul d be extended to stripping.  Modelling should be 
extended to aqueous in organic dispersions, where the continuous phase mass transfer resistance may 
be significant.  Further development should also be considered to account for the effects of surfactants 
and ionic strength.  Since industrial systems will typically have many components in solution (e.g. 
other metals such as iron, calcium etc.), multi-com ponent mass transfer should be considered, using 
the Stefan-Maxwell equations (see Mörters and Bart, 2003).   
Only the copper/hydroxyoxime system has been consid ered so far.  The method should be extended to 
other industrial systems, although there may be l ess data available.  There is a fair amount of 
information in the literature for the Zinc-D2EHP A extraction system (e.g. Mörters and Bart, 2003), 
and this could be considered as a way of extending the modelling.  For other systems, there appears to 
be very little in the way of published kinetic and e quilibrium data.  In this case, modelling would need 
to be supported by an experimental program.

  68 9. INVESTIGATION OF THE HY DRODYNAMICS OF SOLVENT 
EXTRACTION MIXERS 
This section describes computati onal investigations of the hydrod ynamics in mixers for solvent 
extraction.  The work has focused on a laboratory-sc ale physical model located at CSIRO laboratories 
in Clayton, Victoria.   
The work described here follows on from earlier st udies with the CSIRO physical model which have 
already been reported (Bujalski et al.,  2004; Lane et al.,  2008).  The mixer is a square box of side 
length 0.45 m fitted with a pump-mixer type impeller,  which forms part of a physical model mixer-
settler unit.  This unit was designed with the ai m of being typical of industrial mixer-settlers, 
particularly those used in hydrometallurgical opera tions.  The additional work as described here has 
focussed on investigating modifications to the orig inal design, including the addition of baffles, an 
additional impeller in the mixer box, and other de sign modifications such as varying the impeller 
clearance.  The effects of design changes were assessed in terms of their impact on the hydrodynamic 
characteristics and implications for process performance.  
For many of the design variations, experimental measurements were made, mainly based on single-
phase flow in the mixer box.  For two-phase flow  of kerosene dispersed in water, droplet size 
measurements were made using a PVM probe.  Co mputational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling was 
also carried out for single phase and two-phas e flow in the mixer box.  The experimental 
measurements provided a means of validation of the CFD modelling.  The modelling considered 
additional design modifications whic h were not considered in the laboratory.  Significant development 
work was undertaken for the two-phase modelling, in order to simulate the droplet size distribution.  
Through this work, it was demonstrated that the use of an upper impeller is beneficial in increasing 
mixing rates.  It was found that changes such as incr eased impeller clearance or the use of a draft tube 
had the general effect of increasing power consumpt ion and increasing shear rates.  To improve mixer 
box design, it is necessary to reduce the peak shear rates while maintaining suction head.  
Investigation of alternative pum p-mixer designs is recommended. 
9.1 Details of the CSIRO Mixer 
Earlier measurements and modelling of the la boratory tank have been reported (Bujalski et al.,  2004; 
Lane et al.,  2008).  In the previous configuration, th e mixer box was unbaffled, and it was found that 
despite the square shape, a strongly swirling flow deve loped.  This type of fl ow pattern is generally 
considered inefficient for mixing, and therefore, th e mixer box was modified to install four baffles, at 
the centre of each wall.  The baffled design is rega rded as the new ‘base case’ for testing out of 
possible design changes that might improve performance. 
The mixer box design (Figures 48 and 49) has been  chosen to make it typical of industrial 
installations.  The mixer box has a side length of  0.45 m and a depth of 0.3 m in the main mixer 
section.  The baffle width is 0.045 m.  It is fitte d with a ‘false bottom’, consisting of two chambers 
through which organic and aqueous pha ses are separately introduced.  These are connected to the main 
tank by an orifice, above which is a 0.23 m diamet er pump-mixer type impeller (Lightnin R320).  The 
normal operating speed was 200 rpm, which was found to  be high enough to achieve dispersion of the 
organic in the aqueous, but low enough to a void vortex formation and air induction.  
The effect of an additional upper impeller was i nvestigated.  This impeller was a Lightnin A310 
hydrofoil.  Downward and upward pumping impellers were tested (where the latter was a specially 
fabricated mirror image of the former). REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  69 9.2 CFD Methods 
9.2.1 Mesh Generation 
The CFD method involves the numerical solution of the equations governing fluid flow based on a 
finite volume mesh representing the geometry of inte rest.  Therefore, the first step for each simulation 
was to generate a finite volume mesh.  This included details of all the internal geometry including the 
impeller and baffles.   
For the base case, results are reported here for simu lations with two different meshes.  In the first 
instance, a mesh was generated to represent the tank geometry using the CFX Meshbuild software.  
This was a block structured hexahedral mesh with about 500,000 finite volume cells.  Impeller blades 
were represented by ‘thin surfaces’ in order to reduce the mesh size.  Most of the results reported here 
were obtained using this mesh, and these results indi cate that a fairly reasonable representation of the 
flow pattern was obtained.  However, an attempt was made to improve the accuracy by generating 
another mesh using the more recent CFX-Mesh softwa re.  This mesh aimed to achieve best practice in 
meshing, including resolving of the thickness of th e impeller blades, and much higher refinement of 
the mesh at wall boundaries (including impeller blades ), in order to achieve more accurate modelling 
of near-wall flow.  This mesh had a total of about  1.2 million nodes, consisting of tetrahedral elements 
with prismatic layers at the walls.  
For modifications to the tank design, the mesh was generated in each case by modifying the original 
mesh obtained with CFX Meshbuild.  The total numbe r of mesh cells for each case was in the range 
500,000 to 800,000.

pumping A310). 
9.2.2 Solution method 
The equations for conservation of mass and momentum  were solved in the Reynolds averaged form in 
conjunction with the k-epsilon turbulence model.  The equations were solved using the ANSYS 
CFX12.1 software package.  
To account for the impeller rotation, the mesh was ge nerated in such a way that there are two zones: 
one zone for the region surrounding the impeller(s), and another zone for the remainder of the tank 
including baffles.  Two approaches were used: fi rstly, the multiple frames of reference method was 
used, where the impeller is assumed to be in a ro tating frame of reference and is in a fixed position 
relative to the baffles.  For greater accuracy, the sliding mesh method was used (allowing for impeller-
baffle interaction), where the mesh of the impeller zone  is rotated incrementally in small steps, and the 
flow pattern is recalculated until periodi cally repeating results are obtained.  
The flow at each inlet was 15 l/min (for two-phase  simulations).  For single phase flow, only the 
aqueous inlet is used and the flow rate was 30 l/min.  For the outlet, an arbitrary horizontal plane was 
chosen in the overflow weir conn ecting the mixer to the settler.  
Each simulation was run until convergence was ac hieved, which was based on multiple criteria 
included sufficient error reduction of the equations and obtaining a constant or periodically constant 
flow pattern as indicated by monitoring points. 
9.2.3 Investigation of design changes 
Various modifications to the tank configuration we re investigated, some both experimentally and 
computationally, while other configurations we re tested with CFD modelling only.  These 
modifications were assessed on the basis of single-phase flow of water.   
The modifications included: 
 Addition of an upper A310 impell er, upward or downward pumping.  
 Increased clearance of pump mixer impeller. 
 Impeller located higher up in tank with a draft tube. 
 Baffles shortened from bottom, so that there is  no baffling at the level of the pump mixer.  
 Axial flow mixer replacing R320 pump mixer.  
REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  71 For each of these modifications, the effect was assessed in terms of: 
 Flow pattern; 
 Suction head; 
 Power draw of impeller; 
 Circulation flow in tank; 
 Shear and energy dissipation. 
The power was calculated from the predicted torque  on the impeller(s).  The circulation flow was 
assessed by calculating the flow across a horizontal pl ane at the mid-height of the main tank section.  
The suction head is determined from the pressure  difference, measured between the false bottom 
(aqueous side) and the overflow (assumed to be at at mospheric pressure).  The head, H (in metres) in 
calculated according to: 
ΔPHρg  (74) 
where  is the liquid density and g is the gravitational constant.  
9.2.4 Modelling of two-phase flow 
CFD modelling was also carried out for the two-phase flow of water/kerosene mixture, for the mixer 
box agitated by the R320 pump-mixer only, and with  an upper A310 impeller (upward or downward 
pumping).  Simulations were run for the same operating conditions as used in experimental 
measurements of the droplet size distribution.  Th e experimental measurements have provided a basis 
for testing and calibration of alternative models  relating to droplet breakup and coalescence.  
The modelling method was based on the Eulerian-Eul erian approach, where the dispersed phase is 
treated as an inter-penetrating continuum characteri sed by the local volume fraction.  For the drag 
force, the drag coefficient was assumed to follow  the correlation of Ishii and Zuber (1979).  The 
turbulent dispersion force follows the Favre equation option in CFX12. 
To model the droplet size distribution, a population balance approach was taken.  This is a common 
approach, which has been applied to liquid-liq uid systems for many years (see for example 
Coulaloglou and Tavlarides, 1977; Maaß et al., 2007), and similarly applied to gas-liquid systems (e.g. 
Luo and Svendsen, 1996).  Most of the published lite rature refers to ‘standard’ tanks, typically 
agitated with a Rushton turbine and operated in batc h mode.  A recent published study has considered 
the modelling of the droplet distribution with a pump  mixer type impeller and through-flow (Srilatha 
et al.,  2010a), although their pump mixer design was not  actually an industrial-type pump-mixer; 
instead they used hydrofoils or a disc turbine locat ed above an orifice in the bottom of the tank.  
Modelling methods reported in the lite rature have generally not been coupled to CFD simulations.  In 
earlier work, the tank is ‘zero dimensional’, i.e. th e tank is treated in terms of average properties, 
including an assumed average energy dissipation, and there is no resolution of the flow field at all.  In 
other more recent work (e.g. Alopaeus et al ., 2002), a ‘network of zones’ model has been used to 
represent the flow field by a coarse approximation using just a small number of zones with average 
properties.  In the work of Srilatha et al. (2010), a network of zones has also been used, in conjunction 
with a simplified population balance model, where only drops of equal size are allowed to coalesce, 
and the daughter drop size distribution allows for e qual breakage only.  Here, a full population balance 
model has been coupled to the CFD solution, whic h is more realistic, although considerably more 
computationally demanding.  This approach takes in to account the large variations in local energy 
dissipation, which can vary by a factor as large as  100 over the tank, as well as allowing for the correct 
pattern of convection between zones w ith different energy dissipation.   REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  72 Equations are required to model the rates of br eakage and coalescence.  These equations aim to 
describe the physical phenomena in terms of the prope rties of the dispersed and continuous phases and 
simple, known variables, which in nearly all models amount to just the turbulent energy dissipation 
rate, which can be estimated from the CFD si mulation results.  Alt hough population balance 
modelling has been carried out for liquid-liquid dispersions for many years, unfortunately there is as yet no agreement as to the best form of th e equations, amongst the many modelling equations 
proposed over the years.  In some respects, the various equations can be contradictory.  For the 
daughter size distribution, assumptions of some aut hors state that a breakage event is most likely to 
produce two equal size daughter droplets, whereas ot her authors state that this is the least likely 
outcome.  The default equation in CFX12 for breakup (Luo and Svendsen, 1996) takes the latter 
approach, but this was rejected becau se it led to an excessive predicti on of fines.  The default equation 
for coalescence in CFX12 (Prince and Blanch, 1990) was also rejected, because it refers to pure 
systems with mobile interfaces, whereas the droplet s in the real system would have an immobile 
interface because of impurities.  
To specify the most appropriate equations, a starting point was the modelling method of Alopaeus et 
al. (1999, 2002), since their equations were successfully applied to model a system with similar 
properties (kerosene/water), although the tank geomet ry was different (a centrally located Rushton 
turbine).  However, after extensive testing, it wa s found that their equation for the breakage rate did 
not give the correct results.  Therefore, a differe nt equation of breakage was adopted, being that of 
Coulaloglou and Tavlarides (1977), which is the most widely used model for breakup according to 
Maaß et al. (2007).  The equations finally adopted in the modelling are described in Appendix A.  
The equations for breakup and coalescence rates contai n several adjustable constants and the values of 
these were obtained by fitting to the experimental measurements.  In the final results presented, the 
predicted size distributions for different tank c onfigurations are based on a single set of values, 
indicating some degree of generality.  Nevertheless, it remains a limitation of this type of model that 
these constants cannot be known a priori .  Values in the literature vary  quite widely even when the 
same or similar equations are used.  It is likely that  they depend on the chemical characteristics of the 
system.  One factor is the high sensitivity of co alescence rates to surfactants, impurities or ionic 
species.  Values given in the literature will also be  geometry dependent, since they were not obtained 
by fitting to CFD models, but only treat the average properties of the agitation system. 
 
9.3 Results and Discussions 
9.3.1 Base case predictions and validation 
The single-phase flow pattern for the base case is illu strated in Figures 50 and 51.  The flow pattern in 
the main mixer box consists of four recirculation cells  in each of the four corners of the tank, between 
the baffles.  At each baffle, there is upward flow along the leading side of the baffle (from the point of view of the direction of impeller rotation) and downward flow along the trailing side of the baffle.  In 
each side of the false bottom, there is additional reci rculating flow.  The turbulent energy dissipation is 
shown in Figure 52.  Most of the energy dissipation is in the vicinity of the pump-mixer.  
The CFD predictions are compared with PIV measurem ents of the flow field in Figures 53 – 55. In 
general, there is good agreement with the measur ements except that the CFD results show a 
recirculation near the tip of the impeller which is not  seen in the PIV measurements.  It is uncertain 
whether this is an inaccuracy in the model, or a feat ure that has perhaps been lost in the measurements 
e.g. due to averaging or insufficient time resolution.  In terms of the modelling, the close proximity 
between the impeller and baffles may be a di fficulty, since an interface between rotating and 
stationary reference frames must be placed here, and interpolation across the interface may lead to REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  73 numerical inaccuracies.  In most simulations of stirred tanks reported in the literature, the spacing 
between impeller tip and baffles is much larger.  An  alternative method that could account for impeller 
rotation without this interface is the ‘immerse d boundary’ method, and this approach should be 
investigated. 
For the base case, the CFD predictions have b een compared against experimental velocity 
measurements in detail, for results  obtained with the original and revised meshes.  As illustrated in 
Figure 56, the velocity profiles correspond to the inte rsecting lines between several vertical planes  
(x = -0.01, -0.112, and -0.168 m) and seve ral horizontal planes (at different heights z above bottom of 
main tank).  Some of these comparisons are shown in Figures 57 – 60.  In these figures, the position y 
is equal to 0 at tank centre and + 0.25 m at walls.  
Comparisons indicated that there is generally fair ly good agreement with experimental measurements, 
although there are some discrepancies.  The predic ted power draw was also in good agreement with 
measurements (13 W for the revised grid vs. 14.9 W according to measurements).  Simulations with 
the revised grid aimed to reduce the errors, but the improvement is only modest.  This suggests that 
sources of modelling inaccuracy are not due to the me sh.  Other possible sources include the choice of 
turbulence model, and the modelling approach to account for impeller rotation.

  81 9.3.2 Design Modification 
Alternative configurations of th e mixer box have been investigated  using CFD and experimentally.  
These modifications are assessed here in terms of their effect on important process parameters. 
The design modifications include changes to the clea rance of the R320 pump-mixer, or the addition of 
an upper impeller, which was an upward or down ward pumping A310 (see Figures 61 – 66).  These 
modifications were also investigated with the phy sical model.  Comparisons of the flow fields 
according to CFD and PIV measurements for the tank with downward pumping A310 are illustrated in 
Figures 61 – 64.  With the addition of an upper impe ller, the flow pattern is similar but with stronger 
downward flow at the centre.  The CFD results i ndicate some secondary recirculation which is not 
evident in the experimental measurements.  It is un certain whether the difference is due to errors in 
measurement or inaccuracies in the modelling method.  
Other simulations included the investigation of the us e of a centrally located pump mixer with a draft 
tube.  The draft tube connects the impeller to the fals e bottom in order to maintain suction.  The flow 
pattern consists of upper and lower recirculation zones, with high velo cities in the lower recirculation 
(see Figure 67).  A simulation was also carried out w ith shortened baffles, so that there is no baffling 
at the level of the pump-mixer, and this was found to have very little effect on the flow pattern (see 
Figure 68).   
Impeller torque is plotted as a function of clearance in Figure 69.  There is fairly good agreement with 
experimentally measured values.  The trend according to the CFD results is a slight increase in power.  
The experimental results show a slight decrease at 10 mm, with increase thereafter.  Also, CFD and 
experimental results are in fairly good agreement for the suction head, and results for both sets of data 
show a similar trend, with head decreasing as the clearance increases (see Figure 70).  The implication 
of this is that if the same suction head is to be  maintained, the impeller speed must increase, so the 
power will increase even further, and this can be exp ected to lead to finer droplets due to greater shear 
at the impeller.  The circulation flow increases slightly with increased clearance (see Figure 71), 
leading to slightly better mixing, but this is at the cost of higher power.  It can therefore be concluded 
that the impeller clearance should be  kept small to maximise sucti on head for a given power input.  
The effect of clearance is also summarised in Table 3. 
With the addition of an upper A310 impeller, the mi xing in the tank is greatly enhanced, with much 
higher circulation flow rates (see Table 4).  Ther e is also an increase in power (20% downward 
pumping, 40% upward pumping), which would be exp ected with a second impeller.  Based on CFD 
results, the downward pumping impeller produces twice as much recirculation as the R320 alone.  The 
upward pumping impeller produces somewhat lower recirc ulation at the expense of higher power.  On 
this basis, it would seem that the downward pum ping A320 is the better c hoice for enhancing the 
mixing.  The suction head stays about the same because the R320 impeller is kept at the same 
clearance.  The additional power translates into  higher turbulence in the bulk of the mixer box 
(Figure 65), which could lead to smaller droplet sizes.   The effect of the higher circulation rate could 
also be to decrease droplet size through more  frequent exposure of droplets to the high energy 
dissipation zone around the pump-mixer, which may enhance breakup.  On the other hand, much of 
the additional turbulence is added w ith lower values of energy dissipati on rates compared to the region 
near the bottom impeller, which may promote more coalescence in regions away from the impellers.  
The overall effect depends on a balance betw een the additional breakup and the additional 
coalescence.  
For the centrally located impeller and draft tube, th e CFD results indicate that the suction head is 
almost the same as the base case (see Table 4).  However, because the impeller extends beyond the draft tube and is now in a much more unrestricted position, there is a large increase in flow and an 
associated large increase in power consumption.  Th e aim of this modification was to avoid the shear 
produced on the tank bottom by the impeller discharge flow, but this is not successful, because much REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY  
  82 more shear is now produced at the same suction he ad.  This design may still be useful, for example 
with high dispersed phase viscosity or high surface tension, where additional shear is needed to 
generate fine enough droplets.  The draft tube a pproach should also be considered further using 
smaller impellers, i.e. closer in diameter to that of the draft tube. 
For the simulation with the baffle length reduced, so th at there is no baffling at the level of the pump-
mixer, the CFD results indicate that there is no significant effect on the performance characteristics 
(see Table 4). 
An alternative concept was tested (see Figures 72 – 73 and Table 5), where the pump-mixer impeller 
was replaced by a shrouded axial flow impeller.  The motivation for this is that axial flow impellers, 
especially with optimised blade shapes (hydrofoils ), are known to produce more flow with less shear 
compared to radial flow impellers, which could assi st in reducing the amount of very fine droplets 
produced.  Here, the impeller is placed in a cylindrical  shroud to enhance suction.  This also has the 
benefit that the impeller should offer once-through fl ow, so that once droplets are generated, they are 
not exposed again to high shear while in the main tank.  Results for a preliminary design show that 
significant suction can be obtained, with similar pow er inputs but at higher speeds.  The axial flow 
design produces fairly low levels of mixing in the ta nk, so that a second impeller is needed to achieve 
mixing (probably an A310). Further investiga tion is needed to optimise this design.  
As well as considering the average energy dissipatio n in the tank, the peak value of turbulent energy 
dissipation should be considered, since higher ma ximum rates of energy dissipation would be 
expected to generate more fine droplets, since th e peak value of energy dissipation determines the 
maximum size that resists breakup.  Also, the breakag e by highly energetic eddies is likely to be more 
thorough, and instead of a droplet breaking into tw o daughter drops of roughly equal size, shattering 
may occur, producing much finer droplets.  These fine  droplets are then more difficult to separate out 
in the settler.  Therefore, the various design configur ations have been analysed in terms of the peak 
energy dissipation rates.  
Figure 74 shows a plot of the percentage of the mixer box volume exceeding a given value of energy 
dissipation.  For the base case (Lightnin R320 impeller at 5 mm clearance), ~2% of the tank volume 
exceeds 1 W/kg (in regions near the impeller blades ) and 0.9% exceeds 2 W/kg.  Increasing the pump-
mixer clearance generally leads to an increase in the volumes with energy dissipation rates exceeding 
these values, with as much as 4.2% of the vol ume at >1 W/kg dissipation for 50 mm clearance.  
Therefore, it is expected that the effect of incr easing clearance would be to produce finer droplets.  
The addition of the upward or downward pumping A310 impellers also leads to  an increase in the 
volume with more than 1 W/kg dissipation.  Therefor e, the addition of the second impeller may lead to 
smaller droplets.  But as already mentioned, the additional upper impeller also adds turbulence to the 
bulk of the tank at lower dissipation rates, which may tend to promote coalescence through gentle 
collisions.  Overall, it is not clear what the eff ect of the additional A310 impeller should be on the 
droplet size distribution.  As described in Secti on 9.3.3, the CFD and experimental results predict 
opposite trends.  
The use of a draft tube with the R320 gives th e largest volume with these high energy dissipation 
rates, and this would be expected to lead to cons iderably finer droplets for the same suction head. REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY

9.3.3 Two-phase simulation 
CFD simulations were carried out for two-phase kero sene/water mixture, for the base case design and 
with an additional downward pumping A310 impeller.  Figures 75 and 76 show the distribution of the 
dispersed kerosene phase and the Sauter  mean diameter for the base case.  
The predicted droplet size distribution was compar ed at upper and lower positions in the tank (as 
described in the report for the experimental work  – see SXT website) against measurements obtained 
with the PVM probe – see plots in Figures 77 – 80.  The modelled and experimental droplet size 
distributions mostly show a similar curve with a p eak at roughly the same diameter.  However, the 
model predicts droplets at larger sizes, up to about  2 mm, whereas these droplets are not present in 
measurements.  It is a limitation of the PVM probe th at it is not able to measure such large droplets, 
which are too big for the optical window.  Also, the PVM probe cannot measure droplet sizes smaller 
than 50 micron.  Therefore the PVM distributions  are narrower than those from the CFD model.  
Alternative measurement methods are needed for more  definite comparison.  More recently, work has 
been carried out to measure droplet sizes with an  FBRM probe which may offer greater accuracy, but 
the kerosene-water system was changed chemically at the same time by the addition of sodium sulfate.  
This has been found to drastically reduce the mean  size of droplets for the same operating conditions, 
so meaningful comparisons with the previous PVM probe do not seem possible.  
There are several limitations to the accuracy of the population balance mode l, as implemented in 
CFX12 software (the MUSIG model): all droplet si zes are assumed to move with the same average 
velocity, thus there is no separation due to different  slip velocities.  The effect of turbulence in 
redistributing the dispersed phase is only handled in  terms of the overall phase distribution.  There is 
no turbulent dispersion term for the individual si ze classes, and hence no differentiation due to 
different dispersion.  Also, the number of size cl asses implemented in the simulations was somewhat 
limited (about 15), due to the need to solve on every grid cell in the finite volume mesh.  The latest 
version of the CFX software may address some of these problems.  Increased computer power is now 
available which will allow discretisation into a larger  number of size classes.  Further testing of the 
equations for breakup, coalescence and daught er drop distribution is still needed.  
As discussed in the previous section, the add ition of the upper A310 impe ller leads to additional 
turbulence and higher recirculation to the high ener gy dissipation zones, which promotes higher rates 
both for breakup and coalescence.  According to the e xperimental results, the net effect is a reduction 
in Sauter mean diameter at both measurement locations (see Table 6) while the CFD predicts an 
increase in Sauter mean diameter.  Since both methods have a number of limitations, further 
confirmation of the actual trend is needed. REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY

9.4 Conclusion 
CFD modelling was carried out to simulate single-pha se and two-phase flow in a laboratory physical 
model of a solvent extraction mixer box.  Comparison s with experimental measurements indicate that 
the CFD model provides a reasonably accurate predicti on of the flow field and power consumption.  
The CFD model has been applied to investigate a num ber of alternative design configurations.  Some 
of these were also investigated experimentally , and the findings of each method are in good 
agreement. 
It was found that increasing the clearance of the pum p mixer from the tank bottom leads to decreasing 
suction head and increasing power input.  The positi on chosen for the impeller can therefore be made 
depending on the balance of how much suction is need ed versus how fine the droplets need to be.  An 
additional impeller was tested, and this is shown to increase top-to-bottom mixing.  The downward 
pumping A310 was more efficient for mixing than th e upward pumping version.  Turbulence is added 
which may lead to increased rates for both coalescen ce and breakup.  The net effect is a decrease in 
Sauter mean diameter according to the experimental  measurements, but an increase according to CFD, 
and further confirmation of the actual effect is ne eded.  The use of a centrally located pump mixer 
with a draft tube was found to greatly increase power  input for the same suction, which will generate 
more fine droplets, although this arrangement may be useful for dispersed phases with high viscosity 
or surface tension.  Shortening of baffles was found to have no effect.  
The CFD method is recommended for further testing of  design alternatives.  It is suggested that 
alternative impellers should be investigated, such as the preliminary study carried out here for an axial 
flow turbine.  The impeller design should be aimed at producing more evenly distributed shear rates, 
avoiding high local turbulent energy dissipation ra tes, as a means to pr oducing a narrower size 
distribution of droplets with less fines.  It need s to be taken into account that the pump-mixer has 
several functions, including creating suction fo r pumping, breaking up the dispersed phase, and 
mixing the dispersion in the main mixer box.  It may be beneficial to separate these functions.  For 
example, by adding an upper impeller, the sec ond impeller can take over the function of mixing. REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPROVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY

TECHNOLOGY 2 
The outcomes of the SXT project include significant enhancement (breadth a nd depth) of knowledge 
and capabilities necessary to better design and / or operate varying solvent extraction contactors to 
best achieve the operational goals of the production plant.  The somewhat contradictory challenges of 
optimising throughput (in solvent extraction this equates to mass transfer ) whilst reducing operating 
costs (similarly in solvent this equates to selectivity , efficiency and entrainment) have been identified 
and progress toward defining optimal compromises has been made.  With the overall support of the 
sponsors of the Improving Solvent Extraction Technol ogy project the research team was mandated to 
develop a scope for an extension to the study with  an added emphasis on increased knowledge transfer 
and operational impact (i.e . sponsor benefit).  The balance of th is section of the report outlines the 
draft proposal for a second stage of the project  (SXT2) as supported by continuing sponsors. 
10.1 Program goals and research structure  
The overriding goal of the SXT2 program remains to  assist operations achie ve improved performance 
of their solvent extraction operations.  For some ope rators this can be best achieved by targeting 
entrainment - aqueous in organic or organic in aque ous or both.  In other operators solvent extraction 
limited production capacity is the main issue and improving throughput would be a key goal. 
In order to achieve this, the project will continue to  combine the areas of res earch loosely described as 
follows; 
 Development of fundamental capabilities and as ap propriate improved unde rstanding of relevant 
mechanisms, chemistry, speciation, kinetics, mass transfer, entrainment, engineering and 
operational issues, 
  Development of computational code and validated  CFD models for solvent extraction contactors; 
mixers, settlers and columns at laboratory, pilot a nd full scale, for prediction and demonstration of 
performance of units under alternate operating condi tions and existing operations with alternate 
engineering (mixers, baffles, weirs, chevrons , fences, coalescence packs, discs etc),   
 Development of improved probes and physical m odelling capabilities including lab and pilot scale 
facilities for physical demonstration of improveme nts including flow patterns, dispersed phase 
mapping, droplet sizes distributions and entrainment determination, 
 Interaction with operating sponsors s ites and real solvent extraction plants, application of probes to 
diagnose problems and identify opportunities  for improved performance through alternate 
engineering designs and alte rnate operating conditions.   
To achieve these goals the research effort will be coordinated through 4 themes of work each 
coordinated by a senior CSIRO scientist / engineer.  In addition to the core research and development 
activity – site based work will be scoped and designed to allow for ope rating sponsors to derive direct 
benefit whilst core developments are tested in practi cal situations and technology transfer is affected.  
Research findings and test work outcomes will c ontinue to be communicated through both research 
review meetings and written reports as discussed previously.  The following notes outline the research 
plans by theme as initially put forward, discussed and modified as a result of sponsor input at the 
meeting on the 1st of September 2010. REPORT NUMBER 289: MERIWA M401 IMPR OVING SOLVENT EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY

Figure 81. Schematic representation of the Theme structure for SXT2. 
 
The inter-related four themes of research (see Figure 81) are described in more detail in the following 
four sections and as such these sections essentially en capsulate the summarised research plans for each 
of the four Theme’s included in the proposed multi-sponsor SXT2 project.    
10.1.1  SXT2, Theme 1: Computational Modelling 
High Level Goals; 
 Continue to improve the CFD modelling code and how it is applied to the goals of the SXT2 
project. 
 Use CFD modelling to predict flow patterns in ex isting laboratory, pilot and full scale settlers and 
in particular extend its use to modelling improve ments in parallel with the physical modelling 
activities, giving confidence to full scale trialling of plant modifications. 
 Use CFD modelling to predict droplet formation, mixing, mass transfer and coalescence in existing 
laboratory, pilot and full scale mixers (and columns)  and in particular extend its use to modelling 
potential engineering and operating changes in parallel with the physical modelling activities, 
giving confidence to full scale trialling of plant modifications. 
 Provide expert computational modelling support to the SXT2 r esearch team and its sponsors. 
 Develop specific and advanced modelling activiti es with sponsors to assist in selected plant 
optimisation and plant modifications. 
Advancing these goals will help ensure the core  CFD modelling capability continues to develop and 
the application of this tool is increasingly useful in  this project in support of the aims of the SXT2 
project.  Selected specific activities ar e now described in further detail. 
10.1.1.1  Generic improvements in mixer-settler  design (to support Theme 4, Operational

techniques for entrainment meas urements will be selected, including those being practiced by 
sponsors.  With suitable instruments establishe d for entrainment measurements, tests will be 
performed to validate the selected methods and es tablish the best practice for sampling, sample 
storage, sub-sampling and entrainment measurement methods.  Plant visits and site investigations 
may be performed if necessary.  In addition to us ing synthetic organic and aqueous solutions, some 
reagents and real solutions may be  sought from sponsors as appropriate.

10.2 Conclusions 
The three year MERIWA M401 project “Improving Solvent Extraction Technology” has been 
executed and completed along the lines anticipated by  the sponsors.  In addition the major goal of 
achieving “impact” has been directly achieved on th e operations of three different sponsors involving 
velocity and dispersion band measur ements on nine different operating settlers.  This work has led to 
the development of new capabilities, new fundamental knowledge and direct benefit to the operations 
of the sponsoring companies.
