The ideal answer is an extraction of all instances of Nickel/Ni in the reports above.
nickel_instances.csv contains all identified terms.

B1 = All instances of Nickel/Ni extracted.
B2 = Identifies report IDs that mention Ni and at least one specific reference to Ni in the report.
B3 = Identifies report IDs that mention Ni along with some general statement about Ni and it's behaviour or importance.
B4 = Discussions not about or not related to Nickel/Ni in MRIWA's reports (e.g., Nickel/Ni appearing in reports other than MRIWA's reports, general Nickel discussions without reference to specific MRIWA report).
B5 = False statement.
