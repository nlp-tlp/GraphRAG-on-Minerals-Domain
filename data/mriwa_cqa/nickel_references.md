- Page 37 - Total elemental composition analysis (for Ag, Al, As, Ba, Be, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Nb, Ni, P, Pb, S, Se, Si, V and Zn) of the seven samples was performed by (i) X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and (ii) four acid digestion (HNO3/HClO4/HF/HCl) with analysis using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES).
The analysis of all test solutions derived from the sequential leaching, LEAF 1313 test and kinetic leaching included pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and the determination of elemental - concentrations (for Ag, Al, As, Ba, Be, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Nb, Ni, P, Pb, S, Se, Si, V and Zn) by ICP/AES and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).
The residue samples derived from all the sequential leaching tests were analysed for total elemental composition (for Ag, Al, As, Ba, Be, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Nb, Ni, P, Pb, S, Se, Si, V and Zn) by four acid digestion (HNO3/HClO4/HF/HCl) with analysis using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES).

- Page 66 - Non-silicate nickel was mainly present in the crystalline Fe/Mn oxide fraction; a distinct difference to its portioning in sample JN/OB25 (where it partitioned between the carbonate and - recalcitrant oxidisable fractions). 
- Page 68 - Although both methods are expected to extract common metals (Cu, Cr, Co, Ni, Pb and Zn) present as water-soluble, easily exchangeable and carbonate forms, the relationships were - generally poor.
- Page 74 - Nickel also followed similar behaviour; the cumulative mass of nickel from the kinetic leach column (0.032 mg/kg) was higher than that present in both the water-soluble and exchangeable fractions (both <0.001 mg/kg). In this case, the additional nickel may have originated from either the ‘carbonate fraction (0.18 mg/kg) or, less likely, the recalcitrant oxidisable fraction (0.18 mg/kg).

- Page 81 - While conventional acid base accounting methodology using static tests is generally useful for identifying potentially acid forming mine wastes, the sequential leach procedure is particularly useful for identifying mine wastes with potential to produce neutral mine drainage, i.e. circum-neutral seepage containing metals (notably copper, nickel, and manganese) and - metalloid oxyanions (e.g. arsenic and selenium) at concentrations that can affect the quality of surface water and groundwater.

The most significant findings from the field experiments were the elevated concentrations of nickel and lead, neither of which were assessed as significant risks with combinations of these two materials and the four soil types used in the tall column experiment (Table 31, Section 5.5.1.4.1).

Nickel 
Comparison data for nickel leaching characteristics are presented in Figure 66.
As was the case for zinc, LeachXS predicted an initial flush of soluble nickel at very low L/S, with much lower concentrations as L/S increases. These predictions align reasonably well with low measured concentrations in leachates from the tall column experiment. As with copper and zinc (and also lead, Appendix A20), anomalously high concentrations of nickel were recorded in lysimeter leachates from the field trial.
The presence of elevated copper, nickel and zinc in Aroona field trial lysimeter leachates is not consistent with LeachXS modelling of the source material, or the tall column laboratory - experiment, which used Bassendean Ellenbrook soil and not local Jandakot sand

- Page 185 - Results from lysimeter field trials set up and managed by Aroona at the Jandakot and Wanneroo groundwater treatment plants were generally consistent with those of the tall column - experiment, apart from elevated concentrations of nickel and (to lesser degrees) copper, lead and zinc.

- Page 14 - Figure 125: Typical prospective shapes for intrusion hosted magmatic Ni-Cu-(PGE) deposits, from (Barnes et al., 2015)
- Page 18 - The purpose of this project is to gain a better understanding of the magmatic history of the East Kimberley, and to allow for a better evaluation of its prospectivity for magmatic - Ni-Cu-(PGE) as well as reef-style V-Ti-Fe-PGE deposits.
- Page 19 - Mineralogical or geochemical indicators of prospectivity of individual intrusions are limited to moderate degrees of Ni depletion in olivines from the lower portion of the Savannah North intrusion.
This project concludes that Paleoproterozoic arc and collisional environments should be recognised as prospective and conducive to the formation of intrusion-hosted orthomagmatic Ni-Cu deposits, and that the major driver behind the prospectivity of these intrusions appears to be their large-scale tectono-magmatic setting, opening up the entire Central Zone as a prospective - area for Savannah and Savannah North –style systems.
The identification of Copernicus as much younger than Savannah at 1823 Ma appears to indicate that a whole new generation of intrusions, intruding in a post-collisional setting synchronous with the Halls Creek Orogen, can now be considered as potentially prospective for intrusion-hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) mineralisation.
- Page 21 - The first magmatic province in the Halls Creek Orogeny is composed of an extensive suite of mid-crustal intrusions ranging from chromite- and PGE-bearing duniteanorthosite complexes (e.g. the Panton Sill) to peridotite-gabbronorite layered intrusions, two of which (Savannah, Copernicus) host economic Ni-Cu-PGE deposits.
Magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE sulfide deposits are a major source of the world’s resources of these commodities, and as a class include some of the world’s most valuable individual deposits and camps.
It is almost unique among Ni sulfide deposits in showing no signal of crustal sulfur assimilation, being in a very small intrusion, and showing essentially no distal footprint.
- Page 23 - Both magmatic provinces have shown evidences of the presence of economical mineralisation associated with mafic-ultramafic intrusions, such as the Speewah deposit, 4.7 Bt of - disseminated V-Ti-Fe oxide mineralisation and a reef anomalously enriched in platinum group elements, or the massive Ni-Cu-(PGE) rich sulfide mineralisation present within the
Savannah intrusion.
Application of findings to targeting models for intrusion-hosted Ni-Cu-PGE deposits applicable to other craton margin orogenic settings in Western Australia, specifically Musgrave and - Albany-Fraser terranes
- Page 24 - Our study focuses on 1) samples from the Hart dolerite suite, 2) samples from various Cu-Au-Ag prospects within the Speewah dome, both located in the Western zone of the Lamboo - Province, as well as 3) samples from the Savannah Ni deposits and multiple intrusions in the vicinity, located in the Eastern zone of the Lamboo province (Figure 1).
- Page 31 - Sulfides play a key role in the formation of numerous world-class magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE deposits, numerous studies have looked at the mass-dependent (δ34S) sulfur isotopic composition of - magmatic deposits and associated S-bearing country rocks in order to resolve what process triggers sulfide saturation and subsequent ore formation, (e.g., Ripley et al., 1999).
- Page 39 - Each sample was microdrilled multiple times. Sulfur was chemically extracted from the 15–30 mg powders to form silver sulfide by chromium reduction as described by Canfield et al. - (1986) Silver sulfide was fluorinated at 225 °C in a Ni bomb under F2 atmosphere for nine hours to produce SF6
- Page 73 - World-class orthomagmatic Ni-Cu-PGE systems are most commonly associated with large igneous provinces (LIPs) associated with mantle plumes (REF). The occurrence of Ni-Cu sulfide systems in orogenic settings, be it in pre-orogenic arc, syn-collisional or post-collisional settings, have been considered to be less prospective and less likely to host major deposits or camps. However, the occurrence of a number of Ni-Cu-PGE systems in high-grade metamorphic belts and orogens, such as the Ntaka Ni-Cu systems (Barnes et al., 2016c; Tirschmann et al., 2010), - Nova-Bollinger (Maier et al., 2016) or the Savannah deposit, focus of our study, indicate that these settings may be more prospective than previously thought.
- Page 74 - Use the results of these various datasets to get a better understanding of the tectonic setting of the East Kimberley Ni-Cu systems.
- Page 78 - Ni-Cu-Co-(PGE) mineralisation within the Savannah intrusion was first discovered in 1974 by Australian Anglo American (Hoatson and Blake, 2000) during a gossan search to follow up a 42ppm Ni, 81ppm Cu stream sediment anomaly.
- Page 79 - The magmatic Ni-Cu-Co rich sulfide mineralisation of the Savannah North intrusion is described in terms of an Upper (UZ) and Lower (LZ) zone.

- Page 9 - Glycine heap leaching is an emerging metallurgical technology with potential to unlock significant value from copper oxide, gold and nickel ores. 
The project was supported by Sandfire Resources, Barrick Gold, Coda Minerals (previously Gindalbie Metals), Poseidon Nickel and the Minerals Research Institute of Western Australia (MRIWA).
Included in the program of work was metallurgical test work of seven different ores, consisting of gold, copper and nickel samples, that were evaluated through bench scale tests, small - open-circuit columns and large 6m high columns operated in closed-circuit configuration.
- Page 10 Whereas acid and cyanide tend to leach a wide range of elements from the ore, glycine is very selective for copper (Cu) and other valuable metals (Ni, Co, Zn, Au, Ag).
Alternatively, such base metals like nickel, cobalt and copper could be extracted with glycine.
MPS and Curtin University with industry support from Sandfire Resources, Barrick Gold, Coda Minerals (previously Gindalbie Metals), Poseidon Nickel and the Mineral Research Institute of Western Australia (MRIWA) have undertaken this research project to evaluate the commercial opportunities for glycine heap leaching through this MRIWA funded project (M505).
- Page 22 - Figure 15: Particle size distribution of each ore
- Page 23 - Table 5 (cont.): Multi-elemental head analysis
A sequential diagnostic leach was performed on each ore and results are summarised in Table 6 (copper ores), Table 7 (gold ores) and Table 8 (nickel ore).
- Page 24 – For the nickel ore (Ore 7) the large majority of the nickel, cobalt and copper was associated with sulphide minerals.
Table 8: Sequential Head Assay (Nickel Ores)
The nickel ore (Ore 7) represented a sulfidic ore.
The copper (Ores 1, 2 & 5) and nickel (Ore 7) ores also contained acid consuming minerals of carbonates, calcite, dolomite, anatase, magnesite, and ferroan magnesite where ores 1 and 2 contain between 5 to 9% acid consuming minerals respectively.
- Page 27 - Based on the information we know on which minerals acid and glycine leaches, a predicted extraction for copper and nickel were determined for these ores.
Also modelled was the nickel ore (Ore 7). Given we had no information on nickel oxide leaching with glycine it assumed no extraction. It is predicted that acid should leach 81% of the nickel and 95% of the copper while GlyLeachTM is expected to leach 51% of the nickel and 70% of the copper from this ore sample. It is also worth noting that this nickel sample contained significant - acid-soluble serpentine and carbonate minerals that would require a lot of acid that would hamper extraction and make this option inhibitory.
- Page 28 - Table 11: Predicted mineralogy and extraction from modelling for Ore 7 
- Page 29 - Table 12 (continued): Predicted outcomes from the mineralogy information
- Page 45 - Table 18: Bottle roll test conditions and summary of results for Ore 7 
The results showed the acid would extract 75% of the nickel and copper and 45% of the cobalt. GlyLeachTM extracted 45% of the nickel and copper and 12% of the cobalt.
- Page 54 - A second sample was asked for as the first only showed <30% nickel extraction for both acid and glycine.
- Page 55 - Table 23: Mini column test conditions and summary of results for Ore 7 
Curing and glycine leach tended to leach more nickel than cement and glycine leach. Using A3 cure also achieved similar extraction of nickel to just acid cure and acid leach. However, if one compares the two samples similar nickel extractions were achieved with both samples. A noticeable difference was acid tended to leach all the elements while GlyLeachTM leached no iron, only 5% of the cobalt and only copper and nickel which was slower to be leached then in acid.
- Page 64 - They show that the copper and cobalt had reached a maximum extraction but the nickel is still slowly being leached and achieved nearly double the extraction than that achieved in the - 1 m column test. 
- Page 65 - Table 28: Large column test conditions and summary of results for Ore 7 
- Page 74 - For Ore 7, the nickel distribution followed the mass which suggests the nickel is finely disseminated in the ore (Figure 69). Residue sizing was also performed and are presented in Figure 70. It would appear that nickel had leached from all fractions.

- Page 77 - There was a noticeable difference in slumpage under GlyLeachTM compared to acid with the nickel ore (Table 37). 
MPS have undertaken an extensive research program into application of glycine leach technology (GlyLeachTM & GlyCatTM) to heap leaching of copper, gold, and nickel ores.
- Page 78 - Table 38: Conventional process for each ore type 
Nickel sulphides can suffer from poor flotation recovery due to talc or other gangue minerals. Glycine heap leach offers comparable recovery with lower capital and operating cost, and - considerably better product quality. 
- Page 79 - Table 39: Process conditions for each ore type
Nickel recovery and grade were varied as the key sensitivity factor.

- Page 80 - For the copper and nickel cases, the heap leach pad cost was estimated from first principles. 
- Page 81 - 7.2.3 CAPITAL COST – NICKEL PROCESS PLANTS
- Page 82 - Payable metal content was assumed to be 90% for the high-grade copper and nickel sulphides produced by precipitation of glycine leach solutions
The base case nickel product was a lower grade sulphide concentrate, with assumed 74% payable metal content.

Glycine heap leaching offers a significantly lower capital and operating cost compared to conventional grinding and flotation of nickel sulphides. However, the recovery of both routes can vary widely, depending on the ore mineralogy. A high grade, pure nickel sulphide is produced from GlyLeachTM PLS, whereas flotation plants can struggle with low concentrate grades, and may sacrifice recovery in order to produce a saleable product.
- Page 86 - Figure 78: Effect of nickel ore grade
Figure 79: Effect of nickel recovery at a grade of 0.75% Ni
Thus, if glycine heap leach can achieve greater than 36% nickel recovery than it becomes the preferred route over flotation.
Given the flotation performance is hampered with grade, the glycine technology offers a viable option to treat low-grade deposits or waste nickel streams due to the lower cost basis and likely better performance to flotation. However, if one includes the costings to process the flotation concentrate to produce final nickel products this would dramatically increase the CAPEX and operating costs that would elevate the glycine technology to have the greatest economic benefit as it would be possible to produce these final nickel products a lot easier than from flotation - concentrates. 
GlyLeachTM also has a further advantage over nickel flotation in cases where arsenic levels are elevated that creates difficulty in selling the final product.
- Page 87 - Nickel sulphide ores where flotation performance is relatively poor and/or impurity levels are high. 
As part of this investigation seven ore sources were tested four were copper ores, two were gold ores and one was a nickel ore.
- Page 88 - The rate of nickel extraction was shown to be slow for both acid and glycine technology. 
The extractions achieved were borderline economical although subsequent work has shown considerably more nickel can be recovered in tanks at temperature.
This test work program set out to evaluate glycine technology on the dissolution of base metals (copper and nickel) and precious metals (gold and silver) by heap leaching.

- Page 104 - Glycine Leaching Technology is an environmentally benign hydrometallurgical technology that will leach copper, nickel, cobalt and zinc from oxide, mixed oxide and supergene ores, and - even primary sulphide ores. Selectivity: Glycine will solubilise copper, nickel, cobalt and zinc, while iron, manganese, silicates and carbonates remain in the solid phase.
