- Page 9 A recently completed MRIWA funded research project (M505: Glycine Heap Leaching) undertaken by Mining and Process Solutions (MPS) in partnership with Curtin University, looked at the - potential application of glycine to heap leaching of various ores as an economical method of extracting metals. The project was supported by Sandfire Resources, Barrick Gold, Coda Minerals (previously Gindalbie Metals), Poseidon Nickel and the Minerals Research Institute of Western Australia (MRIWA).
- Page 10 - MPS and Curtin University with industry support from Sandfire Resources, Barrick Gold, Coda Minerals (previously Gindalbie Metals), Poseidon Nickel and the Mineral Research Institute - of Western Australia (MRIWA) have undertaken this research project to evaluate the commercial opportunities for glycine heap leaching through this MRIWA funded project (M505). This report summarises the activities and main findings on this MRIWA funded project.
