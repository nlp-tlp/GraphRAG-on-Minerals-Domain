# MRIWA Report Sample Selection

The sample is selected based on the results of an entity analysis using the [`spaCy`](https://pypi.org/project/spacy/) Python package and domain expert input. Numerical values, shown in Table 1, indicate that the selected documents have a high entity density for knowledge graph construction. This sample effectively represents MRIWAâ€™s complete report collection, as it spans multiple minerals research domains.
