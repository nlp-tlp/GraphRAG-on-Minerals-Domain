    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
Work undertaken as part of MERIWA Project M384 compri sed two areas of study: 
further development of the th iosulfate process for the leaching of gold; and the 
exploration of several aspects of sustainable cyanide management. 
 The first of these research areas c oncerned the development and evaluation of a 
new thiosulfate leaching process involving t he use of thiourea as a catalyst for the 
oxidation of gold and the ferric EDTA comp lex as the oxidant. The new process is 
considered to offer some advantages over  the traditional thiosulfate-copper-ammonia 
process, namely it is  potentially simpler and easier to  control, and thiosulfate is 
relatively more stable to oxidation.  Fundamental studies were carried out init ially in order to better understand the 
leaching system, particularly the chemistr y of the oxidation of thiosulfate, and 
leaching tests were conducted to investigate the effects of different variables on the 
kinetics and recovery of gold and to  optimise the leaching conditions. 
 The test work revealed that sulfide mineral s such as pyrite strongly catalyse the 
oxidation of thiosulfate by dissolved oxygen resulting in increased reagent 
consumption. It was found that  thiourea significantly enhances this catalytic effect, 
while hydrogen phosphate ions (HPO
42-/H2PO 4-) reduce the effect. In addition, the 
catalytic effect of pyrite seems to decreas e as the pH increases and is negligible at 
pH values above 9. The presence of ca rbonaceous materials in the ore was also 
found to catalyse thiosulfate oxidation.  No additive could be found which would 
suppress the catalytic effect of sulfides wi thout significantly reducing gold recovery. 
 The effects of various system variables on the leaching of a particular ore sample 
were investigated. It was found that t he thiosulfate-thiour ea-FeEDTA system was 
generally effective and easy to control, with 80% or higher gold recovery achieved 
under most of the conditions investigated. Gold recovery  increased with increasing 
concentrations of thiosulfate, thiourea and FeEDTA, but decreased with increasing 
pulp density and pH. Thiosulfat e consumption increased with increasing pulp density 
and increasing concentrations of thiosulf ate, thiourea and FeEDTA. However, it 
decreased sharply as the pH increased such that the rate was insignificant at pH 
values above about 8.   The new leaching process was then tested  on several mineralogically diverse ore 
samples. Leaching with the new thiosulfat e system produced similar gold recoveries 
to those obtained from cyanidation. However,  it was observed that the thiosulfate 
leaching process seems to be more affect ed by the “nugget effect” than cyanidation 
due to its intrinsic thermodynamic and kinetic  limitations. Therefore, to maintain Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
    efficient leaching with the thiosulfate syst em, finer grinding or longer leaching times 
than normally required cyanidat ion system would be needed. 
 The recovery of gold from synthetic leac h solutions using ion exchange resins was 
also investigated. It was demonstrated that gold could be loaded rapidly and 
efficiently on both strong and weak base resins. The gold loading was reduced in the 
presence of excess thiosulfate and, mo re strongly, by tetrathionate and other 
polythionates. Thiourea did not inte rfere with the ion exchange process. 
 
Another phase of the work in volved investigating potentia l new catalysts and oxidants 
through fundamental studies us ing electrochemical techniques followed by evaluation 
using pure gold dissolution tests and prelim inary leaching tests. Thiosemicarbazide 
was found to be similar to thiourea in ca talysing the anodic oxidation of gold in 
thiosulfate solution and produced high gold recoveries (>90%) under optimised 
conditions. Preliminary studi es on the replacement of Fe EDTA with nitrilotriacetic 
acid (NTA) yielded promising results wit h gold recoveries of up to 75% being 
achieved. However, more work  in this area is required. 
 
The second research area involved the de velopment of a model which can be used 
by site personnel to track the cyanide chem istry in their circuit. The Total Cyanide 
Balance (TCB) model is a relatively si mple web based empirical simulator for 
predicting the deportment of all input cyani de on a gold circuit lease and has been 
designed both as a metallurgical and an environmental compliance tool.  Results from the TCB model are produced as either Static/”Snaps hot” data, in which 
the concentration of cyanide in its variou s forms for each part of the circuit is 
presented, or as Dynamic/”Flow ” data, in which the flow of cyanide around the circuit 
is calculated for each portion of the circ uit. Estimates of HCN emissions from the 
circuit and tailings impoundments are also made in the Dynamic mode. 
 To complement the model development, four cyanide speciation surveys were 
conducted at selected sites. This involv ed the collection and subsequent analysis of 
samples from the leach/adsorption circuit as  well as from the associated tailings 
storage facility and cyanidation water circuit and a review of each of these surveys is 
included in this report.   An additional aspect of this work was the completion of a major literature review of 
technology options for the destruction of cyanide from waste streams. This was 
prompted by the increased requi rement to destroy the cyani de content of gold milling 
effluents as a result of more stringent r egulatory controls on the discharge of cyanide 
waste streams and implementati on of the ICMI Cyanide Code.

4 CHAPTER 1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
A new thiosulfate leaching process which invo lves the use of thiourea as a catalyst 
for the oxidation of gold and the ferric EDTA complex as the oxidant has been 
developed and evaluated. T he new process offers some advantages over the 
traditional thiosulfate-copper-a mmonia process in that it is potentially simpler and 
easier to control and that thiosulfate is relatively more stable to oxidation. 
 Initially, some fundamental studies were ca rried out in order to better understand the 
leaching system, particularly the chemistry of  the oxidation of thiosulfate. Leaching 
tests have also been conducted to investigate the effects of different variables on the 
kinetics and recovery of gold and to  optimise the leaching conditions. 
 In a pure solution, thiosulfat e is stable against oxidation by dissolved oxygen and the 
presence of thiourea does not a ffect its stability.  In the presence of the ferric EDTA 
complex (FeEDTA), thiosulfat e becomes slightly less st able and is oxidised very 
slowly to polythionates. This slight reducti on in stability should not have a significant 
impact on the leaching process and thiosulfat e consumption. However, it was found 
that sulfide minerals such as pyrite strongl y catalyse the oxidation of thiosulfate by 
dissolved oxygen resulting in in creased reagent consumption. 
 The catalytic oxidation of thiosulfate was studied electrochemically and by the use of 
pyrite powder in contact with a thiosulfate solution. The r apid oxidation of thiosulfate 
in the presence of pyrite powder is ch aracterised by a sharp decrease in the 
concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) and  an increase in the solution pH, the latter 
being a result of the reduction of DO. It was found that thiourea significantly 
enhances this catalytic effect of sulf ides while hydrogen phosphate ions (HPO
42-
/H2PO 4-) reduce the effect. In addition, the cataly tic effect of pyrite seems to decrease 
as the pH increases and is negligible at pH values above 9. The presence of 
carbonaceous materials in the ore was also found to catalyse thiosulfate oxidation. 
 The possibility of suppressing the catalytic effect of sulfides using surface active 
reagents was investigated but, while these additives showed limited effects on thiosulfate consumption, they stro ngly reduced the recovery of gold. 
 The effects of various system variables on leaching were investigated. The results 
demonstrated that, for a particular ore sa mple, the thiosulfate-thiourea-FeEDTA 
system was generally effective and easy to control, with 80 % or higher gold recovery 
achieved under most of the conditions in vestigated. The recovery increased with 
increasing concentrations of thiosulfate,  thiourea and FeEDTA, but there appeared to 
be an upper limit beyond which little increase in recovery  was observed. A slight 
decrease in gold recovery was observed as the pulp density wa s increased from 25% 
to 40%. The gold recovery also declined m oderately with increasing pH up to about Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
5 pH 7.5, beyond which pH the decline wa s more significant. An increase in 
temperature from 25 °C to 40°C did not change the final gold recovery appreciably, 
but significantly improved t he initial leaching kinetics. 
 The consumption of thiosulf ate increased with increasing pu lp density and increasing 
concentrations of thiosulfate, thiourea and FeEDTA but decreased sharply as the pH 
increased such that the rate was insignif icant at pH values  above about 8. An 
increase in the temperature from 25 °C-40°C only mildly increased the rate of 
oxidation of thiosulfate. There was only a small loss of the oxidant, FeEDTA, under 
most conditions investigated.  Based on the current work, t he preferred conditions for this leach process are:  
 Pulp density:    30 – 40% Thiosulfate concentra tion:  0.1 – 0.3 M 
Thiourea concentration:  5 – 15 mM FeEDTA concentration:  1 – 3 mM pH:     6.5 – 7.5 
Temperature:   25 – 40 °C 
 
The new leaching process was then tested  on several mineralogically diverse ore 
samples. One finding from the work was t hat the thiosulfate leaching process seems 
to be more affected by the “nugget effect ” than cyanidation due to its intrinsic 
thermodynamic and kinetic limitations. Ther efore, more efficient leaching with the 
thiosulfate system requires finer grinding or longer leaching times than normally 
required cyanidation system. 
 
For 4 of the 5 ores tested in this phase of the st udy, leaching with the new thiosulfate 
system produced similar gold recoveries to  those obtained from cyanidation. In the 
fifth case, gold recovery with thiosulfate leaching was 70-80% co mpared to 92% from 
cyanidation. For one of the ores, it was nec essary to subject t he sample to more 
intensive grinding in order  to obtain a comparable leaching result, and for another, 
5% kerosene was added to deactivate the carbonaceous material and achieve satisfactory gold recovery. Thiosulfate consumption ranged from about 1.5 kg/t to 
around 20 kg/t depending on the mineralogy of t he ore and the leaching conditions 
used.  The recovery of gold from synthetic leac h solutions using ion exchange resins was 
investigated. It was demonstrated that gol d could be loaded rapidl y and efficiently on 
both strong and weak base resins. Of the f our resins tested, Amberjet 4200 and 
Lewatit K6367 gave the highest gold loading followed by Lewatit K6267 and Lewatit 
MP64 (weak base). The gold loading was reduced in the presence of excess Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
6 thiosulfate and, more strongly, by tetrat hionate and other polythio nates. Thiourea did 
not interfere with the ion exchange process. 
 Preliminary Resin in Pulp (RIP) tests we re conducted but satisfactory gold loading 
was not achieved due to t he low gold concentration in t he leach slurry. Further ion 
exchange tests were carried out using a pr egnant solution containing a higher gold 
concentration and the results were promis ing as long as the concentrations of 
polythionates were minimised by maintaini ng the pH at 7.5. Go ld was effectively 
removed from the pregnant solutions afte r 3 batch additions of resin with gold 
loadings of 500-600 mg gold/L resin.   
Another phase of the work in volved investigating potentia l new catalysts and oxidants 
through fundamental studies us ing electrochemical techni ques. Some of the more 
promising compounds were fu rther evaluated using pure gold dissolution tests and 
preliminary leaching tests. 
 
A compound, thiosemicarbazide (Tsc), wa s found to be similar to thiourea in 
catalysing the anodic oxidation of gold in thio sulfate solution at a concentration of 10 
mM. However, increasing the Tsc concen tration to 20 mM showed no further 
benefits, which is different fr om thiourea. The stability of  Tsc was found to decrease 
with increasing concentration and decreasi ng pH. With a concentration of 10 mM, 
Tsc was reasonably stable at pH 6.5 but decomposed noticea bly at 20 mM. The 
decomposition was much less sign ificant at pH 7.5. In gener al, Tsc is less stable than 
thiourea. The rate of pure gold dissoluti on measured in the presence of Tsc was 
similar to that obtained with thiourea.  Leaching of one of the ore samples 
demonstrated that Tsc was a promising catal yst and it was possible to achieve high 
gold recoveries (>90%) under optimised conditions.  
 
Like FeEDTA, ferric nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) complexes were found to be able to 
oxidise gold in the presence of a catal yst. Fe(III) and NTA formed two complexes: 
FeNTA and Fe(NTA)
2. The stability of the oxidants and the rate of pure gold 
dissolution obtained using these oxidants were  found to depend on the Fe:NTA ratio.  
The leaching of gold in t he NTA system under the conditi ons tested was generally 
less effective than the Tsc system. However, the gold recoveries of up to 75% were 
achieved which was reasonable, consideri ng the lack of knowle dge of this new 
system. Consistent with the dissolution resu lts, the leaching performance was found 
to depend on the Fe:NTA ratio and pH. The best results were obtained with a ratio of 
1:2, where the complex Fe(NTA) 2 was expected to be the predominant oxidant.

7 1. INTRODUCTION 
The traditional thiosulfate process for the leaching of gold involves the presence of 
ammonia/ammonium ions and a copper salt in the solution.  Dissolved oxygen is the 
eventual oxidant for the oxidat ion of gold. Copper is believ ed to play a role of “redox 
mediator”, with copper(II) oxidising th e gold and the resultant copper(I) being 
reoxidised by dissolved oxygen back to coppe r(II). The role of ammonia is to stabilise 
the copper in solution. These reactions can be expressed as:   Au  +  2S
2O32–        Au(S 2O3)23–  +   e      ( 1 )  
  Cu(NH
3)42+  +  2S 2O32–  +  e        Cu(S 2O3)23–  +  2NH 3  (2) 
  4Cu(S
2O3)23–  +  16NH 3  +  O 2  +  2H 2O     
4Cu(NH 3)42+  + 8S 2O32–  +  4OH–    (3) 
 In addition, there is some evidence that suggests that the copper and ammonia also 
serve as promoters for t he anodic oxidation of gold. 
 In the previous AMIRA Gold P420B project, an improved thiosulfate (TS) process for 
the leaching of gold was developed as an al ternative to the conventional ammonium 
thiosulfate-copper process. T he new process involves the use of thiourea (Tu) as a 
promoter for the oxidation of gold and the ferric EDTA complex (FeEDTA) as an 
oxidant, since dissolved oxygen is not ef fective in the thiosulfate leaching system. 
 The ferric EDTA complex is one of the most stable comp lexes of EDTA with metal 
ions. The composition of the complex changes with pH and so do its redox 
properties. The reduction reaction can be described by the following equation: 
  Fe
III-EDTA  +  e        FeII-EDTA      (4) 
 Fundamental studies have shown that at pH values below about 7, the reaction is 
fast and electrochemically reversible. Cons equently, the oxidant is effective for gold 
leaching and can be readily regen erated by dissolved oxygen: 
  4Fe
IIEDTA  +  O 2  +  2H 2O        4FeIIIEDTA  +  4OH–   (5) 
 Above pH 7 the oxidant becomes less effe ctive and at about pH 9 it is largely 
ineffective for leaching. Since thiosulfate is  unstable in acidic solutions, a suitable pH 
range for leaching is 6-7.   An advantage of ferric EDTA is that, un like cupric ammine, the oxidant does not 
oxidise thiosulfate at any significant ra te in homogeneous solutions, thus reducing Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
8 reagent losses and minimising the formati on of polythionates which may pose 
problems for the recovery of gold from leac h solutions. However, sulfide minerals in 
the ore have been found to increase the loss of thiosulfate sign ificantly, as the 
sulfides catalyse the oxidation of thio sulfate by dissolved oxygen. The loss of 
thiosulfate is usually accom panied by a rapid drop in the concentration of dissolved 
oxygen and an increase in the pH of the leaching slurry. Ot her factors which must be 
taken into consideration are the high cost of EDTA and t he health issues associated 
with the use of thiourea which is a susp ected carcinogen. Therefore, one of the 
objectives of the P420C projec t was to investigate the use of alternative catalysts and 
oxidants.  In order to obtain a better understanding of the new thiosulfate leaching system, to 
optimise leaching performance,  to reduce reagent costs, and to address occupational 
health and safety issues, a program of work was underta ken comprising fundamental 
studies as well as applied experimental investigations . The following aspects were 
included in the scope of work:  
• Thiosulfate oxidati on and its chemistry; 
• Optimisation of the leaching conditions; 
• Leaching of various ore types, including oxide, sulfide, refractory and preg-
robbing ores; 
• Gold recovery using ion exchange resins; and 
• Possible alternative catalysts and oxidants. 
 The results of this investigation ar e presented in the subsequent sections. 
 
2. THIOSULFATE OXIDATION AND ITS CHEMISTRY 
The loss of thiosulfate during leaching is primar ily due to its oxidation to various 
sulfur species. In aqueous solution, thio sulfate can be oxidised to tetrathionate,

disproportionation of tetrathionate:

 Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
9 It is well known that the abov e reaction is strongly catalysed by thiosulfate. It is 
possible for S 5O62- to disproportionate in a similar manner so th at polythionates with 
greater numbers of sulfur atoms may be formed. However, the stability of a 
polythionate decreases as the num ber of sulfur atoms increases. 
 The chemistry of thiosulfate in this leaching  system is somewhat different from that of 
the conventional copper-ammonia process. In the alkaline solutions of the latter 
process, tetrathionate and other  polythionates are less stabl e and tend to degrade to 
a lower polythionate, or tend to be further oxidised to sulf ite and sulfate. Moreover, 
the decrease of the potentials  of the following half reacti ons with increasing pH also 
makes it easier for reactions (7) and (8) to occur in alkaline solutions: 
 
2SO

42-  +  10H+  +  4e        S 2O32-  +  5H 2O     ( 1 1 )  
 As a result, a drop of pH is normally obser ved despite the strong buffering effect of 
ammonia/ammonium ions. On the other hand, in the new leaching process the 
solution is neutral or slightly acidic, and so reactions (7) and (8) become less 
favourable. In addition, at the lower pH, tetrathionate and some higher-sulfur 
polythionates can be quite stable and, henc e, reaction (9) becomes more dominant. 
 Based on the above discussion, it seems reas onable to use reactions (6) and (9) to 
describe the chemistry associated with the loss of thiosulfate in the current system. 
Test work was carried out to  examine the mechanism of th iosulfate oxidation further. 
 
2.1 Experimental 
Electrochemical studies were carried out using a conventional three-electrode 
system. The working electrode is normally a rotating gold disc electrode and the 
counter electrode a platinum wire. Eit her a Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) or a Hg/Hg
2SO 4 (sat. 
K2SO 4) was used as the reference electrode,  but all potentials  are reported with 
respect to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). The solution was de-aerated with 
pure nitrogen prior to each ex periment, except in the cases where dissolved oxygen 
was required for the experim ents. All the solutions for the electrochemical 
measurements were prepared with Mill i-Q Millipore water and a supporting 
electrolyte (eg, 0.2 M K 2SO 4) was normally used.  
 A stock solution of the Fe-EDTA comp lex (0.05 M Fe) wa s prepared using 
Fe(NO
3)3.9H 2O and Na 2EDTA in a  1:1.1 molar ratio. The solution, adju sted to pH 6.5 
with sodium hydroxide, is a cherry red colour and is stable on storage. To start a 
leaching test, a known amount of the Fe-E DTA stock solution was added to the 
leaching solution (or slurry) cont aining thiosulfate and thiourea. 
 Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
10 The experiments with pyrite powder were  carried out in 500 mL beakers at 25 °C. A 
pyrite specimen (230 g) was crushed and then pulverised in a ring mill for 30 
seconds. A small fraction (~40 g) of this c oarse powder was used for a few tests and 
the rest was reground for another 30 seconds.  The pyrite powder was then stored in 
a desiccator under nitrogen to minimise its contact with oxygen. In each experiment, 
5 g of pyrite powder and 250 mL of solution containing thiosulfate were used (2% solids). The concentration of thiosulfate in  solution before and after each experiment 
was analysed by titration and the loss of  thiosulfate was calculated from the 
difference corrected with any changes in the volume of solution.   The leaching of gold ores was carried out in  stirred reactors. The pH was controlled 
by automatic titration with sulfuric acid. The concentration of dissolved oxygen was 
recorded using an YSI 5739 probe coupled with an YSI 52 Dissolved Oxygen Meter 
or a TPS WP-91 Dissolved Oxygen-pH Meter. The solu tion potential (Eh) was 
measured with a platinum wire against a refe rence electrode. Samples were taken at 
different times during the leach test and the concentrations of gold and iron were 
analysed by commercial laboratories usi ng ICP-MS and ICP-AES, respectively. 
Significant variations of gol d in the residues were noti ced and therefore intensive 
cyanidation was usually performed on the re sidues for 2-3 days in order to get a 
more accurate residual gold content. The c oncentration of thiosulfate was monitored 
by iodometric titration.  
The ore samples for the leaching tests we re prepared by cone crushing followed by 
fine grinding. The use of wet grinding introduc es metallic iron into  the ore, which is 
detrimental to the leaching but can be remov ed by pre-oxidation. Apart from this, the 
leaching behaviour of the samp les prepared by either wet or  dry grinding is generally 
the same. In the current work only the dry method was used. The crushed ore was 
screened with a 150 µm (in some cases, 75 µm) sieve, the coarser fraction being 
pulverised by a ring mill. The screening/milli ng operation was repeated until the entire 
sample passed the sieve.   
2.2 Results and Discussion 
2.2.1 Background Issues 
Before FeEDTA could be used as an oxidant, t he stability of thiosu lfate to oxidation 
by FeEDTA was needed to be tested. A solu tion containing 0.3 M thiosulfate (TS) 
and 5 mM FeEDTA was prepared and stirred in a beaker at room temperature. The 
concentration of thiosulfate was monitored by titration.  No appreciable loss of 
thiosulfate was observed over a period of 12 days, despite a slow increase in the pH 
of the solution (from 6.8 to 7.8). This result indicates that thiosulfate is not oxidised by 
FeEDTA in pure solutions at any significant rate.  Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
11 In the early stages of the work, leaching te sts were generally carri ed out at pH 7, 
which was roughly maintained by intermittent addition of sulfuric acid during the first 
7 hours and the pH was then allowed to in crease to about 9 at the end. Under these 
conditions, the consumpti on of thiosulfate (as S 2O3) was very low, being typically 0-2 
kg/t. The increase in pH was originally a ttributed to the possible presence of acid 
consuming materials in the ore samples. It was later found that the FeEDTA oxidant 
was most effective below pH  7 and, therefore,  the subsequent leac hing tests were 
conducted at pH 6-7 controlled either by the use of a H 2PO 4–/ HPO 42– buffer solution 
or with sulfuric acid via an automated pH controller. As a result, the leaching kinetics 
and gold recovery were significantly impr oved. At the same time, however, an 
increase in thiosulfate consum ption was observed. A review of the results revealed 
that the loss of thiosulfat e was generally lower when the buffer was used as the 
means of pH control rather the automated pH controller. In both cases, the loss 
increased with increasing leac h time. Other possible fact ors included the rate at 
which oxygen was provided into the leachi ng system and the storage time of the ore 
samples after preparation and before use.   Several additional observations were made:  
• The dissolved oxygen (DO) level decreased to almost zero; 
• This was accompanied by an increase in pH; and 
• 1/3 to 2/3 of the FeEDTA ox idant was lost during the test. 
 It appears that the oxidation of  thiosulfate consumes DO, and the reduction of DO 
generates OH
– and so increases the pH of th e solution. These issues were 
investigated further.  
2.2.2 Thiosulfate Stability in the Absence of Ore 
Due to the unexpected increase in thiosulfate consumption during the leach tests, the 
stability of thiosulfate in pure solutions was re-examined. Figure 1 shows the DO 
concentrations recorded for 24 hours in two di fferent solutions containing thiosulfate 
and thiourea. In the absence of FeEDTA, the DO remained at 6.5-7 ppm, the 
approximate saturation level. In the presenc e of FeEDTA, the result was essentially 
the same except at the beginning where a slight drop to about 6 ppm was observed. 
It is clear that, in both solutions, the rate of  oxygen consumption was very low. This is 
consistent with the observati on that there was no significant  change in the thiosulfate 
concentration, confirming that thiosulfate is stable in the presence of FeEDTA.

The above two solutions were analysed for polythionates by HPLC after 24 hours. 
Virtually no polythionates were detected in  the absence of FeEDTA and the pH of the 
solution also remained uncha nged. In the presence of t he oxidant, small amounts of 
tetrathionate and trithionate ( and possibly pentathionate) were found. Accordingly, 
the pH of the solution incr eased noticeably from 6.5 to above 7. However, the total 
loss of thiosulfate based on polythionates was estimated to be less than 1 mM and, 
therefore, could not be easily detected by titration. These results confirm that, (i) 
thiosulfate is reasonably stabl e despite slightly increased oxidation in the presence of 
FeEDTA; and (ii) the oxidat ion must involve dissolv ed oxygen because of the 
increase in pH.   2.2.3 Effect of Copper in the Solution 
An experiment was conduc ted by adding 1 mM CuSO
4 to a solution containing 0.1 M 
thiosulfate, 10 mM Tu and 3 mM FeEDTA and monitoring thiosulfate concentration, 
DO and pH at 25 °C. The thiosulfate concentrati on remained virtually unchanged 
over 24 hours while the changes in DO and pH were similar to those observed in the 
absence of copper. Therefore,  it appears that dissolved c opper does not catalyse the 
oxidation of thiosulfate. This is probabl y because the copper(I) th iosulfate complexes 
produced by reduction of copper(II) by thiosu lfate, cannot be reoxidised by dissolved 
oxygen in the absence of ammonia. Even w hen ammonia is present, the reoxidation 
is unlikely given that the cupric ammine complex is not stable in the pH range (6-7) normally used for leaching.  Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
13 2.2.4 Effect of Iron Hydroxide 
Iron hydroxide was chosen to represent the ir on(III) in the ore wh ich may be able to 
oxidise thiosulfate. Its reduction pot ential was estimated based on the following 
reaction in neutral solutions:   Fe(OH)
3  +  e        Fe2+  +  3OH–       ( 1 2 )  
 
Given E°=0.77 V for the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ and the K sp=2.0x10-39 for Fe(OH) 3, 
the potential for reaction (12) can be calcul ated as a function of pH and the results 
are plotted in Figure 2. As can be seen from Figure 2, it is  thermodynamically 
possible for iron hydroxide to oxidise thiosulf ate at a pH below a bout 6.5, given that 
E°=0.08 V for the oxidation of thiosulfate to tetrathionate.

Four 24 hour tests were conducted to investi gate the effect of iron hydroxide on the 
stability of thiosulfate in the presence or absence of thiourea and FeEDTA. In two of 
the tests the iron hy droxide was prepared in situ by adding Fe 2(SO 4)3 directly to 
thiosulfate solutions while in  the other two tests, solid iron hydroxide was added. The 
pH of the solutions was maintained below 6. 5. No acid was needed in the first two 
tests, whereas a small amount  of acid was required in the second two tests. The 
concentration of iron hydroxi de was 2 g/L. The DO level remained high in all tests 
and no significant loss of thiosulfate was measured in any case. This suggests that 
iron hydroxide is not responsible for the oxidation of thiosulfate during leaching. 
 It was found in the literature that hematite is able to oxidis e thiosulfate at pH 2.9. At 
this pH a considerable amount  of hematite would probably dissolve in the solution 
thereby causing homogeneous oxi dation of thiosulfate by Fe
3+. Under the leaching 
conditions (pH 6-7), however, iron hydroxid e, and presumably hematite as well, are 
probably not soluble enough to oxidise thiosu lfate as demonstrated in these tests. Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology

2.2.5 Loss of Thiosulfate in  the Presence of Pyrite 
Initial experiments were conducted by mixing 10 g pyrite powder with 500 mL 
thiosulfate solution and agitating the sl urry for 24 hours. These experiments were 
conducted under one of the fo llowing pH conditions: uncont rolled, buffered with 0.3 M 
total H 2PO 4–/HPO 42– and controlled by automatic addition of 1 M H 2SO 4 solution. In 
the last case the pH could only be controlled in a range below a set limit because of 
undershooting with the acid, particularly  in the absence of FeEDTA where the 
solution had little buffering capacity.   In the two tests carried out without pH contro l it was observed that, immediately after 
the addition of pyrite, the DO in the so lution rapidly dropped to nearly zero, which 
was accompanied by a prompt increase in pH. The pH continued to increase until 
about 9.5 where it leve lled off. After acid was added to  bring the pH back to 6, the 
cycle repeated, as demonstrated in Figure 3.  In both tests the increase of pH was 
fast, although it was somewhat slower in the presence of FeEDTA because of its 
buffering effect. The rapid consumption of DO  indicates that thiosulfate is oxidised 
more rapidly in the presence of pyrite and the increase of pH is a di rect result of the 
reduction of DO. However, the final losses of  thiosulfate in these two tests were not 
particularly high (9 and 18 mM). This is most likely because the oxidation of 
thiosulfate slows down as the pH increases  and completely stops at pH 9.5 as shown 
in Figure 3. The slightly higher thiosulfat e loss obtained in the presence of FeEDTA 
may be explained by the buffering effect that  maintained a lower pH for a longer time 
after additions of acid.   In tests where the pH was controlled, the loss  of thiosulfate was greatly increased. In 
the buffered systems, the conc entration of thiosulfate wa s reduced by 35.5 mM at pH 
6 and by 19.4 mM at pH 7. In the systems where the pH was cont rolled by automatic 
acid addition, the loss was even higher, being about 4 times the value obtained 
without control of the pH.   Pyrite has been reported in the literature to catalyse the oxidation of th iosulfate in 
aqueous solution. Similar effects have also been observed with other sulfide 
minerals, such as galena and sp halerite. The catalytic reaction was reported to slow 
with increasing pH and tended to stall in alkaline solutions at pH 8.6. These results 
are generally consistent with the findings of  the current work. Therefore, the large 
decrease in thiosulfate stability in the leac h compared with that in pure solutions may 
be attributed to the presence of sulfide miner als in the ore. This also explains the 
relatively low thiosulfate consumption obser ved in earlier leaching tests in which the 
pH was controlled by intermittent addition of sulfuric acid. As demonstrated in Figure 
3, with only a few additions of  acid in the first 7 hours, the pH of the solution was 
above 9 for most of the leaching time, at whic h pH the oxidation of thiosulfate is slow.

 Additional 24 hour tests we re conducted with both coarse  and fine pyrite powder to 
assess the consumption of thiosulfate and re sults are presented in Table 1. For the 
tests with coarse pyrite, the loss of thiosulfate was about 12 mmol with the base 
solution, indicating that pyrite alone was ab le to strongly catalyse the oxidation of 
thiosulfate by DO which was seen to drop sharply upon the addition of pyrite. In the 
presence of 10 mM thiourea, the loss of thio sulfate was increased to about 14 mmol. 
This confirms the observation made in the electrochemical studies (Section 2.2.6) 
that thiourea enhances the catalytic effect of  pyrite. On the other hand, the addition of 
50 mM HPO
42- (with the pH adjusted to 6.5 using NaOH) reduced the loss of 
thiosulfate by about one third.  This effect explains the results of lower thiosulfate 
consumption during leachi ng when a phosphate buffer was used. The agitation was 
performed with a magnetic sti rrer bar in Tests 7-8 instead of an overhead stirrer and 
the results were found to be similar. The advantage of the stirrer bar is its 
convenience but a potential problem  is the grinding of the pow der by the stirrer bar.  
 As can be seen from Table 1,  the loss of thiosulfate wa s greatly increased with the 
use of the finer pyrite powder. Simila r effects of thiourea and phosphate were 
observed, despite the poor reproducibility of the experiments. The use of the 
magnetic stirrer bar posed a more serious pr oblem than in the coarse pyrite tests. 
The continual grinding of the powder gene rated rather milky slurries and the glass 
membrane of the pH electrode was coated with a film of very  fine powder which 
affected the pH reading. Therefore in the following experiments, only overhead 
stirrers were used.   Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology

Tests 17-20 showed that, with increased agitation,  the loss of thiosu lfate significantly 
increased as compared with Test s 15-16. The rate of the ox idation of thiosulfate was 
largely controlled by the rate at which ox ygen was dissolved since the DO level was 
observed to be close to zero throughout the experiments.  
 The presence of thiourea in Tests 21- 22 did not further increase the loss of 
thiosulfate, while the effect  of phosphate in reducing thio sulfate oxidation was again 
confirmed (Tests 23-24).  One of the problems with cont rolling the pH by the automatic addition of 1 M H
2SO 4 
was overshooting when the acid was added due to lack of buffer capacity (except 
when phosphate was present). The instantaneous pH could decrease to as low as 
4.5. This problem is compounded by the p oor long-term stability of the pH probe in 
thiosulfate solutions. From Tests 17-18 onwar d, attempts were made to improve the 
pH control. A lower acid concentration (0.43 M) was used to minimise undershooting and the acid pump was modified so that the acid could be added more slowly in 
smaller drops. With these improvements, it  was possible to control the pH to within 
0.2 pH unit below the set value. As a result, the experimenta l reproducibility was 
significantly improved. Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
17  
The duration of the experiment was found to be another factor affecting the 
experimental results due to a lack of over night monitoring. In order to obtain more 
reproducible results it was decided to repe at the experiments for only 6 hours with 
the modified setup and the results of t hese tests are presented in Table 2.

It can be seen that the data in Table 2 ar e generally much more consistent than 
those in Table 1. The average  loss of thiosulfat e in 6 hours from the base solution 
was 6.73 mmol (Tests 25-26). In the pr esence of 10 mM thiourea the loss was 
increased by about 15% (Tests 27-28). This confirms that thiourea enhances the 
catalytic effect of pyrite . The addition of 50 mM K 2HPO 4, again, reduced the loss of 
thiosulfate by about one third (Tests 29-32) . Essentially the same results were 
obtained with varied K 2HPO 4 concentrations between 100 mM and 20 mM (Tests 33-
36), but 10 mM seemed to be somewhat less effective (Tests 37-38). In the presence 
of 10 mM thiourea, 20 mM K 2HPO 4 was insufficient and it  generally required 50 mM 
to give the same effect as without thiour ea (Tests 39-42). Finally, the presence of 
FeEDTA also increased the loss  of thiosulfate (Tests 45-46). This result implies that 
FeEDTA may be involved in the catal ysed oxidation of thiosulfate.  
 
As discussed previously, the predominant produc ts of the oxidation of thiosulfate are 
polythionates under typical leaching conditions as evi denced by the expected molar 
ratio S 2O3/H2SO 4 = 2. A ratio greater than 2 indi cates that additional acid is 
generated through the formation of su lfite and sulfate so  that less acid is required to 
keep the pH constant. If the ratio is less th an 2, it probably sugges ts that some acid Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
18 is consumed in the acid decomposition of th iosulfate during the excursions to low pH. 
The data in Tables 1 and 2 show  that in most cases the S 2O3/H2SO 4 ratio was 
reasonably close to 2, again confirming that polythionates were the main products of 
the oxidation.  
2.2.6 Electrochemi cal Study of Catalysis by Pyrite 
The oxidation of thiosulfate on the surface of pyrite was investigated using a rotating 
pyrite disc electrode. The anodic reactions we re studied in various solution matrices 
and the results are presented in  Figure 4. The anodic curves can be classified into 
three groups. In group 1, the solution contained only K
2SO 4 and oxidation did not 
occur until about 0.6 V. Obviously, this r eaction was due to the oxidation of pyrite 
itself. In group 2, thiosulfate solutions we re used and oxidation started at a much 
lower potential (about 0.3 V). This reaction is likely to be due to the oxidation of 
thiosulfate on the pyrite surface. However, the reaction rate differed substantially in 
each experiment as the curves were not  quite reproducible. For comparison, the 
oxidation of thiosulfate on a platinum electrode is also  shown and, as can be seen, 
the curve falls into the same potential region as group 2. Therefore, it is not apparent 
whether pyrite catalyses the anodic oxidation of thiosulfat e. In group 3 the solutions 
contained both thiosulfate and  thiourea. It appears that t he presence of thiourea 
significantly accelerated the oxidation of thiosulfate on the pyrite surface, as the 
anodic reaction started at about 0.2 V (the ox idation of thiourea requires higher 
potentials). The mechanism describing the enhancement of thiosulfate oxidation by 
thiourea on the pyrite surface is not clear  at this stage and furt her work is needed.

19 2.2.7 Effect of Activated Ca rbon on Thiosulfate Oxidation 
In order to assess the effect of carbonaceo us materials on thiosulfate consumption, 
Norit activated carbon powder was used in tests similar to those carried out to 
investigate the effect of t he presence of pyrite. An electrochemical study was also 
carried out using a rotating disc electrode made from a Norit activated carbon rod 
(1.7 mm diameter).  The experiments were conducted by mixing 250 mL 0.2 M thiosulfate solution, either 
with or without 10 mM thiourea,  with activated carbon powde r (0.5 g in most cases) 
and stirring for 6 hours. During an experimen t, the pH of the solution was either 
controlled by automatic  titration with 1 M H
2SO 4 (within pH 5.5-7.5) or left 
uncontrolled. The changes in thiosulfate co ncentration were determined by titration. 
The results of all these experim ents are given in Table 3.

As can be seen from Table 3, in the absen ce of thiourea, or in its presence but 
without pH control (No. 1-4) , the concentration of thiosu lfate remained little changed. 
The slight increases in some cases we re most likely due to evaporation as the 
experiments were run in open beakers. Ho wever, in the presence of both thiourea 
and with pH control (No. 5-6), significant losses of thiosulfate were evident. As the 
amount of carbon increased to 3 g (No. 7), the loss of thiosu lfate increased 2-3 times. 
 
The changes in DO concentration and pH  during the above experiments were 
followed and the results are shown in Figure  5. Without pH control, either in the 
presence or absence of thiourea, the pH in creased to above pH 10 immediately after 
the addition of the carbon powder and stayed at  this high level for the entire course of 
experiment. Accordingly, t he DO concentrations remained high and constant. In the 
presence of thiourea and when pH was contro lled in a lower range (5.5-7.5), the DO 
level dropped to below 5 ppm with 0.5 g ca rbon and to nearly zero with 3 g carbon.

 The above results suggest that activated carbon and thiourea together catalyse the 
oxidation of thiosulfate by dissolved oxygen, similar to the effect of sulfide minerals. 
The catalytic reaction consumes dissolved oxygen and causes the pH to increase. 
 
2.2.8 Electrochemical Study of Catalysis by Activated Carbon 
Figure 6 shows the electrochemical oxidati on of thiosulfate on an activated carbon 
electrode in 0.1 M Na
2S2O3 at pH 6.6. Without thiourea the oxidation of  thiosulfate 
occurred only at potentials hi gher than 0.4 V. This potent ial is higher than that 
normally observed on a gold or platinum el ectrode and, therefore it  is understandable 
that activated carbon alone has no effect on th iosulfate oxidation. In the presence of 
thiourea, however, the oxidat ion produced a significant negat ive shift of the potential. 
Considering the previous fi nding that thiourea does not change the stability of 
thiosulfate in solution, it c an be concluded that  it is the combined action of both 
thiourea and activated carbon that cata lyses the oxidation of thiosulfate. 
 It can be seen from Figure 7 that, in the absence of thiourea, the oxidation of 
thiosulfate shifted to higher potentials as  the pH increased. In the presence of 
thiourea and below pH 8, the catalytic oxidat ion was not greatly affected by pH. At pH 
9.4 or higher, the catalytic oxidation was seen  to be suppressed, particularly at higher 
potentials. When a faster sc an rate (100 mV/s) was used, however, no suppression 
was obvious (Figure 8). These results ma y suggest that the accumulation of the 
oxidation products on the carbon surfac e at the higher pH values may have Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
21 deactivated the carbon and eventually terminated the catalytic reaction. With the fast 
scan rate, the amount of ox idation product generated was very small and did not 
affect the carbon activity.

2.2.9  Possible Additives to Reduce Thiosulfate Consumption 
Attempts were made to suppress the catalytic effect of pyrite by  blocking the active 
sites on the pyrite surface using additives.  Ideally these additives would selectively 
inhibit the reactivity of the pyrite but not  affect the oxidation of gold. Flotation 
collectors, such as xanthat e, which are surface active  and selectively adsorb on the 
surface of sulfide minerals, were consider ed as a possible optio n. Indeed, Figure 9a 
shows that xanthate reduced the activity of  pyrite. In the presence of 10 ppm and 50 
ppm xanthate, the oxidation of pyrite shifted to more positive potentials. 
Unfortunately, a very strong negative effect on the gold electrode was also observed. 
Figure 9b shows that the oxid ation of gold was significan tly hindered in the presence 
of only 1 ppm xanthate, whil e 10 ppm xanthate inhi bited the reaction completely. This 
may be attributed to the strong affinity between gold and the thiol group in the 
molecule of xanthate.           Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology

Reagents which are commonly used to se lectively depress sulfide minerals are 
cyanide and sulfide salts, but neither is suit able for practical use at neutral pH. Figure 
10 shows the oxidation reactions on pyrite a nd gold electrodes in the presence of 10 
ppm and 100 ppm NaHS.xH 2O. The oxidation of sulfide to elemental sulfur was 
observed on both electrodes at  about -0.05 V. Although the oxidation of thiosulfate 
on the pyrite electrode was not significantly  suppressed, the oxidation of gold was 
clearly inhibited by bisulfi de ions at a concentration of  10 ppm and totally passivated 
at 100 ppm.

Polysaccharides are commonly used as non-sel ective depressants in the flotation of 
some sulfide minerals. The effects of some  of these compounds on the oxidation of 
thiosulfate and gold were investigated and the results are shown in Figure 11. It can 
be seen that all three samples, at a concent ration of 100 ppm, were able to suppress 
the oxidation of thiosulfate on pyrite surfac e to a limited extent, particularly Vitax and 
guar gum. However, the oxidat ion of gold was strongly inhibited, with the curves 
being shifted by more than 100 mV in the positive direction.  The effect of A.R. grade 
starch on both reactions was much less significant.

 In summary, all the reagents investigated di d not appear to be suitable as additives 
for the purpose of reducing thiosulfate co nsumption without reducing the rate of 
leaching of gold.  
2.2.10 Leaching of Ore Sample A 
In order to expand upon the findings from the electroche mical and other fundamental 
studies, a series of leachi ng tests using the TS-Tu-FeEDTA system was carried out 
on Ore Sample A. This sample, obtained from  a mine site approximately 400 km east 
of Perth, Western Australia , was analysed by XRF and for so me metals by ICP. In 
addition, the sulfur content was also analysed.  Results are listed in  Table 4. Prior to 
leaching, the sample was roasted at 600 °C for 1 hour in the presence of air to 
remove sulfides.

Unless noted, all leaching tests were ca rried out at ambient temperature (21-25 °C) 
with 40% pulp density for 24 hours. The ore samples were prepared by grinding in a 
ring mill to -75 µm. The leac h solution contained 0.3 M Na 2S2O3, 10 mM Tu and 3 
mM FeEDTA. A cyanide leach was usually performed on the residue from the thiosulfate leach using 1 g/L NaCN. Results of the tests ar e summarised in Table 5. 
 
In Tests M1-M4, the ore samples were roasted at 600 °C for 1 hour, and the colour of 
the samples turned from grey to brown in dicating the formation of iron oxides. The 
average mass loss due to roasting was 1.08%, after correcting for a moisture content 
of 1.33%. Assuming that t he sulfides were present as pyrite and based on the 
following reaction:   FeS
2        0.5Fe 2O3  +  2SO 2       ( 1 3 )  
 it appears that the sulfide c ontent in the ore may be hig her than the value of 0.31% 
given in Table 4, since the LOI of  the ore sample is negligible.

aThe cone crushed ore was pre-screened at  -75 µm and used for leaching tests. 
bThe +75µm portion after pre-screen was milled to -75 µm before leaching. 
*A new batch of samples was used starting from M10.  
 
The leaching of the roasted or e resulted in a very low cons umption of thiosulfate (M1-
M4), i.e., about 2 kg/t after 24 hours leaching with 0.3 M Na 2S2O3 or up to 3 kg/t for 
48 hours leaching with 0.1 M Na 2S2O3. Corresponding to the low thiosulfate 
consumption, the DO level in  the slurry remained high (> 7 ppm) and the pH remained 
constant throughout the leach period. These re sults confirm that the sulfide in the ore Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
27 was largely responsible for the high thiosulf ate consumption during leaching and that 
the increase in pH is due to the reduction of DO.  Another benefit of roasting pr ior to leaching is that th e concentration of the oxidant, 
FeEDTA, changed little during the leaching (F igure 12), in contrast to significant 
losses observed in previous tests. The re sult seems to suggest that the loss of 
FeEDTA is related to t he loss of thiosulfate.  
 For reasons not known at this stage, over all gold recovery from the roasted ore 
samples was somewhat lower than that  from the untreated ore, even after 
cyanidation (normally gold recovery is  80-90% with thiosulfate leaching).

 In the presence of sulfides, one possible way to reduce thiosulfate consumption is to 
reduce the concentration of DO. This ca n be done by purging nitrogen through the 
leach slurry (Test M5). However, the thiosulfate consumption was only marginally reduced.  
In Tests M1-M5, the results of the assay of  the leach residues varied significantly, 
indicating the possible presence of large gold  particles in the original ore samples 
and this affected the reproducibility of the l each tests. This was demonstrated further 
in Tests M6-M9. The cone crus hed ore was pre-screened at 75 µm and the finer 
portion was used directly for M6 and M7. T he coarser portion was then ground to -75 
µm before use in Tests M8 and M9. As ca n be seen, Tests M6 and M7 resulted in 
high gold recovery (~95%) with a relatively c onsistent residual gold assay, due to the 
absence of large gold particles in the finer portion of the ore. However, the leaching 
of the coarser portion (M8 and M9), even afte r a size reduction, gave much lower and 
less reproducible gold recovery (89.3 and 80.5%, respectively). Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
28  
From Test M10 onwards, a new  batch of ore was used fo r the leaching. As can be 
seen, the new sample gave comparable gold recoveries to the previous samples but 
consumed appreciably more thiosulfate (M10 – M13). This is probably associated 
with the fact that fresh sulf ide surfaces were exposed in the second batch. In an 
attempt to oxidise the sulfides, the leac hing slurry was purged with oxygen for 24 
hours before leaching (M14 and M15). The thiosulfate consumption was reduced 
slightly. The oxidation of sulfides might not be efficient under th e conditions used (for 
example, the pH was not high enough).  In Tests M16-M21, the effect of various additives on thiosulfate consumption and 
gold recovery were investigated. It can be seen from Table 5 that all the additives 
including xanthate, NaHS and  starch reduced thiosulfate consumption considerably. 
At the same time, however, the gold reco very was also lowered significantly. The 
most remarkable effect was obtained with 10 ppm xanthate, which reduced 
thiosulfate consumption by about  two thirds, but completely inhibited the leaching of 
gold. The effects of NaHS a nd starch were moderate in both respects. These results 
are consistent with the predictions based on the electrochemical studies. 
 
2.3 Conclusions 
The chemistry associated with the loss of thiosulfate during the enhanced leaching 
process has been studied. In pure solutions, thiosulfate was stable against oxidation 
by dissolved oxygen and the presence of thi ourea did not affect it s stability. In the 
presence of FeEDTA, thiosulfate became s lightly less stable and was oxidised very 
slowly to polythionates. This slight reducti on in stability should not have a significant 
impact on the leaching process and thiosulfat e consumption. Moreover, the addition 
of copper(II) to thiosulfate solution in t he absence of ammonia and the contact of the 
solution with Fe(OH)
3 powder under the pH of leaching did not result in any 
appreciable loss of thiosulfate.  However, it was found that  sulfide minerals such as 
pyrite catalyse the oxidation of thiosulfat e. Even a small amount of  sulfide in the ore 
greatly increased thiosulfate consumption during the leach.  Preliminary studies with 
pyrite powder indicated that the catalysed oxidation of thiosulfate was characterised 
by a sharp decrease in the DO concentrati on and an increase in the solution pH, the 
latter being a result of the reduction of  DO. Polythionates were the predominant 
products of the oxidation. The use of a phosphate buffer as a means of pH control 
instead of acid addition reduced thiosulf ate consumption by about one third. The 
catalytic effect of sulfides decreased as the pH increased and was completely lost at 
pH values above 9. In the pr esence of sulfide minerals,  the FeEDTA complex seems 
to be more actively involved in the oxidat ion reaction though it is otherwise quite 
stable with respect to oxi dation of thiosulfate. 
 The catalytic effect of sulfide minerals has been investigated electrochemically using 
a pyrite electrode. While it is not conclu sive whether pyrite itself catalyses the Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
29 oxidation of thiosulfate, the reaction on the pyrite surface is greatly accelerated in the 
presence of thiourea in solution.   Tests with activated carbon powder and a carbon electrode have shown that thiourea 
appears to be necessary for the catalytic effe ct of carbon. At high pH, the catalytic 
effect seems to diminish. This effect is similar to that of sulfide minerals but the 
mechanism may be different.  The possibility of suppressing the catalytic effect of sulfides using surface active 
reagents has been investigated th rough both electrochemistry and leaching tests. A 
number of additives were studi ed, including xanthate, s odium sulfide and various 
polysaccharides. While these additives show ed limited effect on reducing thiosulfate 
consumption, they strongly reduced the gold recovery.  
3. PROCESS OPTIMISATION 
This part of the investigat ion was aimed at th e optimisation of t he enhanced leaching 
process. The effects of various leaching parameters were studied through a large 
number of leaching tests using the Ore Sa mple A. As was noted previously, the Ore 
Sample A contained signific ant amounts of coarse gold which could not be leached 
effectively during the standard 24 hour leac hing procedure, causing large variations 
in the assays of the leach residues due to the so-called nugget effect. To avoid this 
problem, the ore samples were pre-treated using a Knelson gravity concentrator to 
remove most of the coarse gold, improving the reproducib ility of the test results 
significantly.  
3.1 Experimental 
In order to separate the coarse gold, about 25 kg of the or e was ground to a P
80 of 
106 µm and then passed through a KCMD3 Knel son gravity concentrator. The 
conditions used were as follows: 
 Knelson fluidization water:   19 kPa   4.5 L/min 
Slurry waster flow:   2 L/min Feed rate:    300 g/min (measured)      257 g/min (calculated)  The duration of the test wa s 95 minutes with 132.7 g concentrate removed. The 
Knelson tail was then allo wed to settle and the supernat ant water decanted to yield a 
slurry containing 55% solids which was used for all the tests. A size distribution 
analysis revealed that about 35%  of the sample was under 20 µm while the rest was 
quite evenly distributed in  the size range of 20-212 µm. 
 Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
30 The leach tests were conducted in 1 L beak ers agitated with an overhead stirrer. The 
slurry was made up by transfer of a desir ed amount of the stock slurry which had 
been vigorously stirred for at least half an hour, and then diluted to the required pulp 
density. The pH of the slurry was contro lled by automatic addi tion of standardised 
H2SO 4 solution (~1 M). With the improved se tup (Section 2.2.5), the pH could be 
controlled within 0.1 units be low the set value. All the tests were run for 24 hours. 
The pH electrode was recalibrated after 1, 3 and 7 hours during each test in order to 
minimise the effects of drift.  
3.2 Results and Discussion 
Table 6 summarises the conditio ns and results of all the thio sulfate leaching tests on 
Ore Sample A. The variables invest igated include pulp density, reagent 
concentrations, pH and temperature. Dup licated tests were run for each of the 
conditions and, in some cases, repeated afte r some time to ma ke sure that no 
significant changes had occurred in the ore sample. It can be seen from Table 6 that 
the leaching system is generally effect ive under most conditions, with the gold 
recovery being close to or above 80%. The r eproducibility of the leaching results was 
greatly improved as a result of remova l of the coarse gol d by the Knelson 
concentrator, and the difference in gold re covery between duplicat e tests is generally 
within one percentage point. Th e calculated head was typica lly 1.1-1.3 g/t and the 
gold in the residue was 0.17-0.28 g/t. The a ssay of gold in the residue was usually 
repeated a few times and the av erage was used in the calculation of gold recovery. 
The fact that the measured S
2O3/H2SO 4 ratios are all below 2 (except in one case) 
indicates that the ore itself consumes acid.  A number of cyanidation tests were al so conducted using 300 and 500 ppm NaCN 
for comparison with thiosulfate leaching . Gold extraction ranged from 73.7% to 
77.6% and from 72.0% to 74.1% fo r the 300 and 500 ppm NaCN solutions, 
respectively. Thus, it was found that for th is sample cyanide leaching under practical 
conditions was generally not as effective as thiosulfate leaching.   Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology

32 3.2.1 Effect of Pulp Density 
The detailed results of leaching tests usin g various pulp densities are presented in 
Figure 13a-g. With 0.3 M Na 2S2O3, 10 mM Tu and 3 mM FeEDTA, the leach kinetics 
appeared to be largely independent  of the pulp density (Figur e 13a) while the final 
gold recovery decreased slightly with incr easing pulp density ( 84.5% at 25% solids 
and 81.5% at 40% solids (Figure 13b). This result is largely consistent with the 
residual gold grade which increased slightly  with increasing pulp density (Figure 13c). 
 Figure 13d shows that thiosulfate consumpt ion increased from 7.9 kg/t at 25% solids 
to 10.7 kg/t at 40% solids. This unusual b ehaviour may be attributed to the catalytic 
effect of sulfide minerals which we re present in the ore sample.  
 The thiosulfate consumption is closely re lated to the concentration of DO in the 
slurry. A lower level of DO reflects a fast er rate of thiosulfate oxidation and thus 
higher thiosulfate consumption.  In the extreme case in wh ich the DO drops to zero, 
the rate of thiosulfate oxi dation is then determined by the rate at which oxygen from 
the air is dissolved into the slurry. Figure 13e demonstrates a tren d in which the DO 
concentration increased as the pulp density dec reased. This trend is consistent with 
that of thiosulfate consumption shown in Figure 13d.  
 
Another trend shown in Figure 13e is that, at all pulp densities, the DO level 
increased as the leaching proceeded, indicati ng that the oxidation of thiosulfate 
slowed down during the leaching. At the lo wer pulp densities the concentration of DO 
increased as high as 7.5 ppm, which is  close to the saturation level at 25 °C. This 
result agrees with the observati on that the increase in pH wa s faster in the first few 
hours of leaching and gradually becomes slower  with time. As a re sult, the rate of 
acid addition required to maintain the pH was significantly faster in the initial stage.  Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology

34 to increasing levels of DO. The potentia l appeared to decrease with increasing pulp 
density, but the differences we re insignificant ( generally within 20 mV) and should not 
have a great impact on the leach results.  Finally, the total concentration of iron (which  is equivalent to th e concentration of 
FeEDTA) was followed in each of the tests and the results are shown in Figure 13g. 
As can be seen, the concentration of the oxidant dropped slightly in all the tests, 
especially at 40% pulp density. However,  the drop was not as significant as 
previously observed and no clear trend wit h thiosulfate concentration was obvious. 
 Although the leaching kinetics and gold recovery was only moderately affected by the 
pulp density, the viscosity of the slurry increased noticeably at 40% or higher solid 
content, particularly after the addition of th e reagents. This significantly increased the 
difficulties in agitation and fi ltration. Therefore, a pulp density of 35% was used in 
subsequent tests.  
3.2.2 Effect of Thiosulfate Concentration 
The effect of thiosulfate concentration was investigated in a concentration range of 
0.1-0.3 M. The other conditions used for the leaching tests included: 10 mM Tu, 3 
mM FeEDTA, pH 6.5 and 25 °C. The detailed results of t hese tests are presented in 
Figure 14a-g. 
 
Figure 14a shows that an increase in thio sulfate concentration from 0.1 M to 0.2 M 
appreciably increased the initial leaching rate . A further increase to  0.3 M thiosulfate 
did not further improve the leaching kinetics to any significant extent. Nevertheless, 
despite the different initial ra tes, the final gold recoveries were quite similar. After 24 
hours, the gold recovery increased from 80 .4% with 0.1 M thiosulfate to 82.6% with 
0.2 M (Figure 14b). A further increase in thiosulfate concentration (0.3 M) only 
marginally improved the gold recovery to 83.5%. This result is confirmed by the 
concentration of gold in the leach residues (Figure 14c).  Figure 14d shows that the thiosulfate consumption in creased significantly as 
thiosulfate concentration increased (from 7.2 kg /t at 0.1 M to 10.1 kg/t at 0.3 M). This 
result is not surprising since the rate of thiosulfate oxidation could be expected to be 
proportional to the thiosulfate concentration . In accordance with this result, the DO 
concentrations in the slurries decreased with increasing thiosulfate concentration, at 
least in the first 7 hours (Figure 14e). The solution potentials were also consistent 
with the variations of the DO  but, again, the difference was small, i.e. wit hin about 10 
mV (Figure 14f).  The changes in iron concentration (Figure 1 4g) were similar to those shown in Figure 
13g. The drop in the concentration of t he oxidant in each of the tests was 
insignificant. No clear trend with thio sulfate concentrations was seen.  Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology

36 Considering the combined effects of thio sulfate concentration on gold recovery and 
reagent consumption, a concentration of 0.2 M was selected for the subsequent 
tests.  
3.2.3 Effect of Thiourea Concentration 
The effect of thiourea concentration was investigated using solu tions containing 0.2 
M thiosulfate, 3 mM FeEDTA and 5-20 mM th iourea. The results are presented in 
Figure 15a-g. As can be seen from Figure 15a, with as little as 5 mM thiourea, gold 
was leached effectively with a recovery of greater than 80% being achieved in 24 
hours. As the thiourea concentration was increased to 15 mM, both the initial 
leaching rate and the final gold recovery  increased but no further benefits were 
observed at a higher thiourea concentration  (Figure 15b). Consistent results were 
obtained from the an alysis of the gold in the leac h residues which demonstrated the 
same trend as obtained from so lution analysis (Figure 15c). 
 Previous studies using electrochemical tec hniques have shown that the rate of the 
oxidation of gold in a thiosulfate solution  continues to increase as the thiourea 
concentration increases up to 50 mM. In th e leaching system, however, the leaching 
rate may become limited by the concentration of DO, which is the ultimate oxidant 
and can be low due to reaction with thiosu lfate if the reagent concentrations are 
sufficiently high. This is probably the case when more than 15 mM thiourea was 
added to the leaching solutions. The same  explanation is also applicable to the 
limited improvement in gol d recovery when the thiosulfate concentration was 
increased from 0.2 to 0.3 M (Figure 14b).  
 As found previously, the presence of thiour ea enhances the catalytic effect of sulfide 
minerals on the oxidation of thiosulfate. This effect wa s confirmed in the leaching 
tests. Thus, Figure 15d shows that the loss of  thiosulfate increased substantially with 
increasing thiourea concentration. As expect ed, the concentration of DO dropped as 
the thiourea concentration was increased (Fi gure 15e). The loss of thiosulfate did not 
reach a limiting value, even at the hig hest thiourea concentration investigated. 
Therefore, the combination of the results in Figure 1 5b and d indicates that, beyond 
about 15 mM, any further increase in thi ourea concentration will not improve the 
recovery of gold but will increase the consumption of thiosulfate. 
 The changes of the solution potential with thiour ea concentration s hown in Figure 15f 
are consistent with the variations of DO levels (Figure 15e) but, again, these changes 
were not significant and were within a range of about 10 mV. The changes of iron 
concentration were similar to those observ ed in other tests. The iron concentration 
dropped slightly but there was no clear trend with respect to thiourea concentration.

38 3.2.4 Effect of FeEDTA Concentration 
The detailed results on the effect of FeED TA concentration are shown in Figure 16a-
g. The tests were performed at 35% pulp  density with fixed concentrations of 
thiosulfate (0.2 M) and thi ourea (10 mM). With only 1 mM FeEDTA, the leaching rate 
and gold recovery as shown in Figure 16a were substantial. As the oxidant 
concentration was increased to 3 mM, both the leaching kinetics and gold recovery were improved quite considerably (F igure 16a and b). Howe ver, no further 
improvements were observed when the conc entration was increased to 4 mM. These 
results agree well with the assays of gol d in the leach residues (Figure 16c). 
 As previously suggested, FeEDTA may be in volved in the oxidati on of thiosulfate. 
Even though direct oxidation by  FeEDTA is slow, the reac tion may also be catalysed 
by sulfide minerals. Figure 16 d confirms this negative effect  as the loss of thiosulfate 
nearly doubled when the concentration of  FeEDTA changed from 1 to 4 mM. A 
suitable concentration of FeEDTA is pr obably 3 mM considering both gold recovery 
and thiosulfate consumption.  The concentrations of DO shown in Figure  16e were less consistent with the loss of 
thiosulfate than was observed in  the other tests. At low concentrations the DO level 
dropped with increasing FeEDTA concentrati on but this trend was not obvious at 
higher concentrations. No explanation is available for this different behaviour. 
 Solution potentials were found to increas e with increasing FeEDTA concentration, as 
shown in Figure 16f, although the variations we re still not significant (within about 20 
mV). The concentration of iron in each case remained fairly constant, indicating there 
was no significant loss of the oxidant.  Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology

40 3.2.5 Effect of pH 
The effect of pH was studied in the r ange of 6.5-8.0 with a 35% pulp density in 
solutions containing 0.2 M thiosulfate, 10mM Tu and 3 mM FeEDTA. The results are 
given in Figure 17a-g. It was found previously  in the electrochemic al studies that the 
reduction of FeEDTA on a gold surface was inhibited as the pH increased above 6.5. 
This finding was confirmed in the leach tests. Figure 17a clearly  demonstrates that 
both the initial leaching rate  and the final gold recovery decreased with increasing 
pH. It can be seen from Figure 17b that t he decline in gold recovery was moderate 
up to pH 7.5 but became signi ficant at pH 8. These results are confirmed by the 
increasing gold levels in the leach residues (Figure 17c). 
 In contrast to its negative effect on gold re covery, an increase in pH was found to be 
beneficial for the stability of thiosulfate. It is evident from Figure 17d that a small 
increase in pH from 6.5 to 7.0 greatly r educed the thiosulfate consumption (by about 
two thirds). Further reductions were observ ed at higher pH values and at pH 8.0 the 
loss of thiosulfate was reduced to a neg ligible level of 0.32 kg/t. These results 
suggest that the catalytic effect of the su lfide minerals is str ongly dependent on the 
pH.   Figure 17e demonstrates that t he DO levels in the leach slurries increased as the pH 
increases. At pH 7.5 and pH  8.0, the concentrations of DO were essentially 
maintained close to the saturation level, i ndicating that the oxi dation of thiosulfate 
was very slow. These observations are cons istent with the thio sulfate consumption 
shown in Figure 17d. There was no clear trend of the small variations of solution 
potential either with respect to pH or  with respect to DO concentration.  
 Finally, Figure 17g shows the changes of iron concentration during the leaching 
tests. As can be seen, the loss of the oxidant became incr easingly significant as the 
pH increased, particularly at the highest pH  (8.0). The FeEDTA complex undergoes a 
compositional change at pH values above 7 to incorporate a hydroxide ion as in the 
reaction   FeY  +  OH
-    '    FeOHY-       ( 1 4 )  
 in which Y denotes EDTA.   This change may have an impact on the stability of the co mplex. Although the 
complex was found to be generally stable up to pH 10, it s stability may deteriorate to 
some extent, and some precipitation may o ccur upon contact with the ore samples.

42 It is obvious from the above that pH is a cr itical variable in the enhanced thiosulfate 
leach process. A lower pH is favourable fo r the dissolution of go ld while a high pH 
helps reduce the oxidation of  thiosulfate. There is a lo wer limit for the pH (probably 
around 5.5) below which larg e amounts of thiosulfate will be lost through acid 
decomposition. There is al so an upper limit (around 8) above which the FeEDTA 
oxidant becomes ineffective and significant losses in recovery may occur. Considering all these fa ctors, a pH range of 6. 5-7.5 appears to be optimum. 
 
3.2.6 Effect of Temperature 
Temperature is an important variable for most  chemical processes and, therefore, its 
effect on the thiosulfate leaching proce ss has been investigated. It has been found 
previously that an increase in  temperature is likely to negat ively affect the thiourea-
catalysed anodic oxidation of gold, particularl y in the high potential region. The effect 
of temperature on the overa ll leaching reaction using Fe EDTA as the oxidant was 
examined in this section of the investigation. The test s were conducted at a pulp 
density of 35% using solutions containing 0.2 M thiosulfate, 10 mM thiourea and 3 
mM FeEDTA at pH 7.0. The detailed resu lts are presented in Figure 18a-g. Results 
shown in Figure 18a clearly de monstrate that the kinetics in  the first few hours were 
markedly improved as the temper ature increased from 25 to 40 °C. However, the final 
gold recovery remained essentially the same  at all temperatures (Figure 18b). The 
residual gold levels were all around 0.2 g/ t confirming that the leach was effective 
and efficient (Figure 18c). 
 
Figure 18d shows that t here was a moderate increase in t he loss of thiosulfate as the 
temperature rose from 25 to 30 °C with no further increase at higher temperatures. 
The concentration of DO decreased with in creasing temperature (F igure 18e) partly 
due to the more rapid oxidation of thiosu lfate, and also partly due to the reduced 
solubility of oxygen from the air. The va riations of the so lution potential with 
temperature were still insignificant (Fi gure 18f). Figure 18g shows that the loss of 
FeEDTA increased slightly as  the temperature rose. However, the loss was generally 
minor, being within 20% for the entire period of leaching.   The facts that the leaching rate was enhanc ed at higher temperat ures and that the 
thiosulfate consumption was not seriously increased are beneficial for the leaching 
process. At higher temperatur es, it may be possible to use lower concentrations of 
thiosulfate, thiourea and FeEDTA which would reduce reagent costs and thiosulfate 
consumption, but without si gnificant loss in the leach kinetics and gold recovery. Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology

44 3.3 Conclusions 
The pre-treatment of Ore Sa mple A with a Knelson concentrator to remove the 
coarse gold has proved successful in improv ing the reproducibility of the leaching 
experiments. The leaching of Ore Sample  A with the enhanced system was shown to 
be effective, with 80% or higher gold recove ry achieved under most  of the conditions 
investigated. The leaching pr ocess is relatively simple and easier to control than the 
conventional process. The gold recovery in creases with increasing concentrations of 
thiosulfate, thiourea and FeEDTA, but ther e seems to be a limit for each of the 
reagents. A slight decrease in gold recovery was observed as the pulp density was 
increased from 25% to 40%. The gold re covery also declined moderately with 
increasing pH up to about pH  7.5, beyond which point the effect became more 
significant. An increase in temperature from 25 °C to 40°C did not change the final 
gold recovery appreciably, but significantly  improved the initial leaching kinetics. 
 The consumption of thiosulf ate increased with increasing pu lp density and increasing 
concentrations of thiosulfate, thiourea and  FeEDTA but decreased substantially as 
the pH increased. At pH 8 t he oxidation of thiosulfate e ffectively ceased. An increase 
in the temperature from 25 °C to 40°C only mildly increased th e rate of oxidation of 
thiosulfate. Decreased DO concentrations were observed during the leaching as a 
result of thiosulfate oxidati on. A lower level of DO usually indicated a faster rate of 
the oxidation. The solution pot ential was not significantly affected by changes in the 
operating parameters.  There was only a minor loss of the ox idant, FeEDTA, under most conditions 
investigated but this loss became more signi ficant at pH values greater than 7.5. 
 
After consideration of the most important factors of gold recovery, thiosulfate 
consumption and loss of the oxidant, t he preferred conditions for the enhanced 
leaching process are considered to be:   Pulp density:    30 -40% Thiosulfate concentra tion:  0.1-0.3 M 
Thiourea concentration:  5-15 mM FeEDTA concentration:  1-3 mM pH:     6.5-7.5 
Temperature:   25-40 °C

45 4. LEACHING OF VARIOUS ORE TYPES 
In order to investigate the efficacy of t he TS-Tu-FeEDTA proce ss, further leaching 
tests were performed with a number of ore samples of different types, namely: 
 
• Ore Sample B – an oxide ore from the Eastern Goldfields area of Western 
Australia, containing 0.5 g/t Au; 
• Ore Sample C – a sulfide ore from t he Eastern Goldfields area of Western 
Australia, containing 3 g/t Au and 1.23% S2-; 
• Ore Sample D –  an oxi de ore from West Rand in north west South Africa, 
containing 4.4 g/t Au, 0.59% S2-; 
• Ore Sample E – a carbonaceous, pr eg-robbing ore from north central 
Nevada, U.S.A., containing 11.8 g/t Au, 0.23% S2- and 2.2% C org. 
• Ore Sample F – a highly refractory or e, both in terms of sulfide encapsulated 
gold and naturally occurring graphitic (p reg-robbing) materials, containing 
3.8 g/t Au, 2.3% S2- and 0.3% organic carbon. 
 A number of leaching tests were conduc ted with each of the ore samples under 
various conditions. Cyanidation and, in so me cases, leaching tests using the 
conventional thiosulfate process, were  also performed for comparison.  
 
4.1 Experimental 
Ore Samples B and C were crushed and rod milled to a P
80 of 75 µm prior to 
leaching, while Ore Sample D was rece ived as ready-to-use split samples (P 75 of 75 
µm). Ore Sample E was also ground to P 75 -75 µm and for Ore Sample F, samples 
having P 90 of 40 µm were used for the leaching test work. 
 The leaching of gold ores was carried out in  stirred reactors. The pH was controlled 
by automatic titration with sulfuric acid. The concentration of dissolved oxygen was 
recorded using an YSI 5739 probe couple d with an YSI 52 Dissolved Oxygen Meter 
or a TPS WP-91 Dissolved Oxygen-pH Meter. The solu tion potential (Eh) was 
measured with a platinum wire against a refe rence electrode. Samples were taken at 
different times during the leach period and the concentrations of gold and iron were 
analysed by commercial laboratories using ICP-MS and ICP-AES respectively. The 
concentration of thiosulfate was fo llowed by iodometric titration. 
 A stock solution of the Fe-EDTA comp lex (0.05 M Fe) wa s prepared using 
Fe(NO
3)3.9H 2O and Na 2EDTA in a  1:1.1 molar ratio. The solution, adjus ted to pH 6.5 
with sodium hydroxide, has a cherry red colour and is st able on storage. To start a 
leaching test, a known amount of the Fe -EDTA stock solution is added to the 
leaching solution (or slurry) cont aining thiosulfate and thiourea.

46 Electrochemical studies were carried out using the conventional three-electrode 
system. The working electrode is normally a rotating gold disc electrode and the 
counter electrode a platinum wire. Eit her a Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) or a Hg/Hg 2SO 4 (sat. 
K2SO 4) was used as the reference electrode,  but all potentials  are reported with 
respect to standard hydrogen electrode (SHE ). The solution was de-aerated with 
pure nitrogen prior to each ex periment, except in the case s where dissolved oxygen 
was required for the experim ents. All the solutions for the electrochemical 
measurements were prepared with Mill i-Q Millipore water and a supporting 
electrolyte (eg, 0.2 M K 2SO 4) was normally used.

4.2.2 Cyanidation Tests 
All the samples were subjected to cyanidat ion except Ore Sample F for which the 
results of cyanidation were provided by the mining company which supplied the 
sample. The cyanidation was carried out in bottle rolls with 500 ppm initial NaCN in 
solution, 50% solids (45% solids for Ore Sa mple E) at pH>11 fo r 24 hrs. The results 
of the cyanidation tests are shown in Table 8.

 The recovery of gold from the oxide ores  was 92% and 96% for Ore Sample B and 
Ore Sample D respectively, but only 62% for Ore Sample C. This is probably because some of the gold is locked in the sulfide minerals, such as pyrite. The results from the 
supplier have shown that direct cyanidation onl y recovers 2.9% gold from Ore Sample Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
48 F but about 45% gold can be recovered by CI L. Virtually no gold  was leached during 
cyanidation of Ore Sample E, confirming t he highly preg-robbing nature of the ore.  
 A conventional ammonium th iosulfate leaching test was also conducted on Ore 
Sample E. Test conditions were: 45%  solids, ambient temperature (20-22 °C), 0.1 M 
(NH
4)2S2O3, 100 ppm Cu and pH 9. Air was pur ged at 2 reactor volumes per hour. 
These are the conditions recommended by mining company. However, the carbonate 
in the ore was found to be insufficient to  buffer the pH and a small amount of NaOH 
was used to maintain the pH. The pH dropped to 8.7 at the end of the leach. It was 
found that 67% of the gold was recovered in this test, the significantly higher 
recovery being due to the fact that the dissolved gold was pr esent as the gold-
thiosulfate complex which does  not adsorb on the carbon. 
 Conventional thiosulfate leach tests have al so been conducted on Ore Sample F in a 
separate study and 40% gold reco very was obtained. This resu lt is consistent with the 
results from the supplier in that the fr ee gold content of Ore Sample F is about 40-
50%.  The results of thiosulfate leaching on each of the ore samples us ing the new process 
are discussed in the following sections. The l eaching conditions were similar to those 
used in the previous work on Ore Sample A.   4.2.3 Leaching of Ore Sample B 
A total of 12 tests were conducted for Ore Sa mple B, with the first test terminated 
due to failure of the pH controller. The bas e conditions of the tests were: 40% solids, 
0.2 M Na
2S2O3 (TS), 10 mM thiourea (Tu) and 3 mM FeEDTA at 25 °C. Variations 
were made to the base conditions as required and are noted  in Table 9 which 
provides a summary of the results.  The effects of several leach conditions su ch as pH (6.5-7.5), pulp density (40-50%) 
and thiourea concentration (5-10 mM) were  investigated. The gold recoveries 
obtained were generally in the range of 70%-80%, which compare with 92% from 
cyanidation tests (Table 7). No obvious trend s could be discerned fr om these results. 
This may be partly attributed to the low co ncentration of gold in the sample since the 
changes in gold recoveries due to variat ions of leaching conditions would be 
expected to be small. On the other hand, the “nugget e ffect” was probably more 
significant. It can be seen from Table 9 that t he assays of gold in the residues varied 
considerably, suggesting the presence of c oarse gold particles. Consequently, the 
calculated gold recoveries bore relatively large errors which may have covered up 
any changes due to variations of leaching  conditions. A similar effect was also 
observed in early work on the leaching of Or e Sample A and it was overcome by the 
removal of the coarse gold by gravity separation.

As Figure 19 shows, the leachi ng was fast in the first 7 hours after which the rate 
decreased rapidly. Such behavio ur is consistent with the results obtained with Ore 
Sample A and may be explained assuming t he fine gold was rapidly dissolved in the 
early stages, leaving the lar ge gold particles which dissol ved very slowly due to the 
much reduced surface area. This explanati on is supported by t he fact that, in a 
number of assays, the residue go ld levels were well below 0.1 g//t (Table 9) which is 
comparable to the resu lts of cyanidation.  
 It appears that the “nugget effect” affects th iosulfate leaching more than cyanidation. 
Thus, Table 8 shows that the residue gold levels after cyanidation were consistently 
low (0.037 g/t). This suggests that the so-called “large gold particles” in the 
thiosulfate system do not pose a problem for cyani dation and this c ould be one of the 
limitations of the thiosulfat e system. It has been found previous ly that the rate of gold 
dissolution in the TS-Tu-FeEDTA solutions is at least 10 times slower than in cyanide 
solutions under oxygen diffusion control. Ther efore, practical solutions to the “nugget 
effect” of thiosulfate leaching are probabl y to increase retention time and to use Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
50 particle sizes finer than normally used in  cyanidation. These methods have been 
proved effective in the case of Ore Sample A, but were not tested with Ore Sample B 
due to its low head grade.

Figure 19.  Kinetic Curves for the Leaching of Ore Sample B 
 
 Despite the lack of trends in the recovery of  gold, there are obvious trends in the data 
for the consumption of thiosu lfate. As shown in Table 9, thiosulfate consumption 
clearly decreased with increasing pH, increasing pulp density and decreasing 
thiourea concentration. These trends agree with those obtained from test work on 
Ore Sample A, apart from the effect of pul p density. In the case of Ore Sample A, 
thiosulfate consumption incr eased with increasing pulp density because of the higher 
sulfide content which catalysed the oxidati on of thiosulfate. In general, however, 
thiosulfate consumption dur ing the leaching of Ore Sample B was not high. 
 Table 9 also shows that the ratio of consumed S
2O3/H2SO 4 added was well below 2 
at pH 6.5, indicating that the ore consumed acid at this pH. At a higher pH the ratio 
was close to 2. It was also noted that about  4-5% solids dissolved during the leaching 
at all pH values tested. However, no atte mpt was made to analyse the composition of 
the leach solutions since this loss of soli ds did not seem to have any effect on the 
leaching.  
4.2.4 Leaching of Ore Sample C 
The base conditions for the leaching of Ore Sample C were: 50% solids, 0.2 M 
Na
2S2O3, 10 mM Tu and 3 mM FeEDTA at 25 °C. Six tests were performed and the 
results are shown in Table 10. Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology

The first two tests were conducted at pH 7.5 and the gold recoveries were 52% and 
44% respectively, which compares unfav ourably with the result from cyanidation 
(62%, Table 8). The nugget effe ct was again evident from the considerable variations 
in the residue gold assays and the final gold  recoveries. The thiosulfate consumption 
was 6-7 kg/t ore which was high compared with oxide ores at the same pH. 
Moreover, the thiosulfate consumption incr eased significantly at pH 7.0 to 11 kg/t 
(Tests 3 and 4) which accounts for 50% of  the total thiosulf ate added. The sulfide 
minerals and organic carbon were probably responsible for the high thiosulfate 
consumption because both have been found to catalyse the oxidation of thiosulfate 
by dissolved oxygen. The gold recoveries at pH 7.0 were somewhat lower than at pH 
7.5 (40% and 49%, respectively), probably due to the greater loss of thiosulfate and, 
also possibly, to the precipitation of el emental sulfur. The pr esence of elemental 
sulfur from the decompositi on of polythionates, which may accumulate to high 
concentrations in this case, was observed in the solution samples.   In order to minimise the “nugget effect”, a further tw o tests were conducted with a 
finer sample at pH 7.5 (Tests F1 and F2). The ore was milled down to 99.7% less 
than 75 µm which compares to 80% less than 75 µm used for the other tests. As a 
result, much improved gold recovery and reproducibility were obtained as can be 
seen from the results in Table 10. The reco very of greater than 68% was slightly 
better than that for cyanidation (62% ) probably because more gold had been 
liberated from the sulfide minerals as the particle size was reduced. On the other 
hand, thiosulfate consumption al so increased as a result of increased surface area of 
the sulfides. Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology

The kinetic curves for these tests are shown in Fig. 20. These curves appear to have 
similar shapes to those obtai ned from oxide ores, except that the gold recoveries 
were lower. Most of the leac hing occurred in the first 7 hours, while the leach kinetics 
and the reproducibility of  the tests were improved by fine grinding.

Finally, the S 2O3/H2SO 4 ratio was about 1.1 at pH 7. 5 indicating that acid was 
consumed by the ore. The ra tio dropped to 0.85 at pH 7.0 suggesting more acid was 
consumed at the lower pH. Since thiosulfat e consumption was high with this sulfide 
ore, the acid consumed is also significant. The amount of acid required to maintain 
the pH was 5 g/t at pH 7.5 and 11 kg/t at pH 7.0, whic h is about 5 times the amount 
required for Ore Sample B at the corresponding pH value.  
 
4.2.5 Leaching of Ore Sample D 
Ore Sample D was received as split samples in which coarse gold had been 
removed by gravity separation prior to sp litting. The base conditions for the leach 
tests were: 50% solids density, 0.2 M Na 2S2O3, 10 mM Tu and 3 mM FeEDTA at pH 
7.5 and 25 °C. The effects of several variations  from these base conditions were 
evaluated. The detailed result s are presented in Table 11. 
 The first 6 tests were performed at pH va lues of 6.5, 7.0 and 7.5. High gold 
recoveries of over 90% were  obtained though in two cases, the gold recoveries were 
lower at 82 and 83%. These results are comparable with those obtained from the 
cyanidation tests (96%, Table 8). Howeve r, further tests suffered from poor 
reproducibility and yielded mu ch reduced gold recoveries  (66-84%), even under the 
same leaching conditions. The reason is not cl ear at the present ti me but it does not Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
53 seem to be due to the “nugget effect” sinc e the residue assays and calculated head 
levels were reasonably consistent.

54 A noticeable change in the l eaching kinetics was observed and this is demonstrated 
for some of the tests in Figure 21. With Te sts 5 and 6 “normal” leaching curves were 
obtained, which display a fast initial stage followed by a sl ow stage. In Tests 8, 19 
and 20, however, the initial rate was lo wer and leaching continued at measurable 
rates even after 24 hours. T he change cannot be explained by  solution conditions as 
the DO levels remained close to saturation (7 -8 ppm) in all tests except those at pH 
6.5 (3-4 ppm) and the Eh values were a ll in the normal range. In addition, no 
significant loss of iron was observed. Furt her work is needed to resolve this unusual 
behaviour.

 Despite the poor reproducibilit y of gold recovery, the data on thiosulfate consumption 
were very consistent and logical. From Table 11, the thiosulfate consumption was 
13.5 kg/t at pH 6.5 which dropped  significantly to 4 kg/t at pH 7.0, 1.5 kg/t at pH 7.5 
and 1 kg/t at pH 8.0. The sulfide content (0.59%) in the ore is believed to be 
responsible for catalysis of the oxidation of thiosulfate at the low pH but the catalytic 
effect was suppressed at increased pH values. At pH 6.5 precipitation of S
0 was 
observed in the solution samples after filtration. This could have an effect on the 
leaching if the precipitation occurred during the leaching. Therefore, a higher pH is 
preferred for this ore.   Table 11 also shows that the ratio S
2O3/H2SO 4 was less than 2 suggesting that the 
ore consumed some acid.   Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
55 4.2.6 Leaching of Ore Sample E 
The base conditions used for the TS-Tu-Fe EDTA leaching were: 45% solids, 0.2 M 
thiosulfate, 10 mM thiourea, 3 mM FeEDTA, pH 7.0 and 25 °C. A total of 12 tests 
were conducted and the detailed re sults are presented in Table 12.

*The base conditions are: 45% solids, 0.2 M TS, 10 mM Tu, 3 mM FeEDTA, 25 °C, pH 7.0. 
 
At 45% solids (P1–P6), gold recoveries of  50–55% were generally obtained. The gold 
recovery was slightly higher at pH 6.5 t han at pH 7.0 and 7.5. The same trend has 
been observed for Ore Sample A. The thiosu lfate consumption of 12-13 kg/t ore was 
generally higher compared to Ore Sample  A and no reduction was apparent as the 
pH increased up to pH 7.5. This is different  from Ore Sample A for which the sulfide 
catalysed oxidation of thiosu lfate was found to slow signif icantly at higher pH values. 
The S 2O3/H2SO 4 ratio measured was much lower than the theoretical value of 2 
indicating that the ore consumed acid as a result of its carbonate content. With a 
lower pulp density, i.e. 40% solids (P7 an d P8), gold recovery increased slightly 
(55%) but thiosulfate cons umption increased substantially to about 20 kg/t. 
 The sulfide content of Ore Sa mple E was similar to Ore Sa mple A and so the higher 
thiosulfate consumption is believed to  be due to the carbonaceous material. 
Therefore, an attempt was made to deactivate the carbon by adding 5% (V/V) kerosene to the leach slurry (P9 and P10). As a result, gold recovery increased to 
about 70%, which was comparable to the conv entional thiosulfate leach result. In Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
56 addition, the thiosulfate consumption dec reased by about 30% compared with the 
same conditions without kerosene.  
4.2.7 Leaching of Ore Sample F 
Four leaching tests were conducted on Ore Sa mple F using base conditions of: 50% 
solids, 0.2 M Na
2S2O3, 10 mM Tu and 3 mM FeEDTA at 25 °C. The pH was set at 
7.0 for the first test but, because of the low initial pH of the slurry, the pH did not 
reach the set value until about  7 hours, after which it was automatically controlled. 
There was no pH control in Te st 2 and the final pH was 8.2 (see Figure 22). In Tests 
3 and 4, the pulp density was reduced to 40% and the pH  was controlled at 7.0 by 
first adding NaOH and then H 2SO 4. The results of these test s are presented in Table 
13.  It can be seen from Table 13 that gold recoveries of 47–49% were obtained 
consistently regardless of the variations in leach conditions . This agrees well with the 
results of cyanidation and conventional thiosu lfate leaching tests in that the free gold 
content was about 50%. Further more, the variations in the residue gold assays and 
in the calculated head grade were small, suggesting that Ore Sample F was quite 
uniform in terms of gold distribution.

Figure 22.  Changes in pH during Tests 1 and 2 with Ore Sample F  
 
 From the leaching curves show n in Figure 23, it is evident  that the gold leaching was 
essentially complete in the first hour in al l tests. On the other  hand, the solution 
potential (Eh) was extremely low, being at 90 mV and 120 mV (with respect to 
standard hydrogen electrode, SHE) in 50% and 40% solids pulp, respectively (Figure 
24). Normally the Eh is around 200 mV for the TS-Tu-FeEDTA leaching system. The 
low Eh was also confirmed by the absenc e of the normal yellow colour of the 
FeEDTA complex in the solutions after filtra tion. Thus, it appears t hat the free gold in 
Ore Sample F was extremely fine and was leache d very rapidly. It is possible that, in 
this case, dissolved oxygen may be an effective oxidant.

Sample F 
  
Figure 24 also shows that about two th irds of the iron (a dded as FeEDTA) was 
lost during leaching, possibly due to adsorption by the carbonaceous 
materials. In this part icular case, however, the lo ss of iron had no effect on 
gold leaching which was completed soon a fter the start. For comparison, the 
loss of iron during the leaching of Ore Sample B was only about one third, 
while in the case of Ore Sample C no significant loss was observed. 
 
The thiosulfate consumption was about 7 kg /t at 50% solids density which increased 
to 20 kg/t at 40% solids. This can be explai ned by the high viscosity in the 50% solids 
pulp. The agitation was inefficient and, as a result, the rate of dissolution of oxygen 
was slow. The measured DO level was zero throughout the test whereas at the lower 
pulp density it was 0.2-0.4 ppm . Therefore, at the higher pulp density the thiosulfate 
consumption was limited by the ava ilability of dissolved oxygen.  
 From Table 13, the S
2O3/H2SO 4 ratio was 3.5-4 for the firs t two tests. These results 
are consistent with the fact that the ore did not consume acid. In Tests 3 and 4 in 
which the acid was neutralis ed at the beginning by addition of NaOH, the ratio was 
close to 2.   
4.2.8 Analysis of Polythionates and Thiourea 
Several final solution samples from the le ach tests on Ore Sample C, Ore Sample D 
and Ore Sample E were analysed at CSIRO by HPLC for thiourea and polythionates. 
A Dionex AS16 co lumn with AG16 guard and a soluti on of 0.1 M perchlorate was 
employed as the eluant. The species separa ted in the column were analysed by a 
UV-Vis detector which was capable of re cording the absorbance at multiple 
wavelengths simultaneously. The wavelengths used for various species are: 235 nm 04080120160

As can be seen from Table 14, the conc entration of thiourea remained at about 8 
ppm confirming that thiourea was stable during leaching as found in previous studies. 
There is a good correlation between the loss of thiosulfate and the formation of polythionates. At pH values  between 7 and 7.5 the concentrations of tri- and tetra-
thionates were similar and that  of pentathionate was much smaller (about 1/3). All the 
polythionates seemed to be stable in solu tion under the leaching conditions and 
accumulated to relatively high concentrati ons. Leaching of Ore Sample D produced 
the lowest concentrations of polythiona tes and leaching of Ore Sample E, the 
highest. It can also be seen that, even for t he sample from Ore Sample E Test P3, 
which was analysed 4 days after the leach had finished, the results were similar to 
those of Test P5 which was analysed on t he same day as the leach was conducted. 
This indicates that polythionates are qui te stable under the leaching conditions. 
 The chromatograms from the HPLC analysi s of samples from Ore Sample E Tests 
P3 and P5 are shown in Figure 25. It was f ound that the FeEDTA complex split into 
two species on the column, some Fe(III) sp ecies and EDTA, the latter being eluted at 
the same time as thiosulfate. As shown in Figure 25, the sequ ence of the species 
coming out of the column was Tu, Fe(III), S
2O3/EDTA, S 3O6, S4O6 and S 5O6. It can 
also be seen in Figure 25 that the sensitivit y of detection for different species varies 
with the wave lengt h. While the most sensitive wave length for S 4O6 and S 5O6 is 210 
nm, S 3O6 is best detected at 192 nm. For the same reason, the peak for Fe(III) 
disappears at 235 nm so the peak for thiourea can be resolved.

4.3 Conclusions 
Several additional gold ores have been us ed in the present work to assess the 
general applicability of the new thiosulfate leaching system.  
 For Ore Sample B, the results are generally similar to those obtained previously with 
Ore Sample A. Regardless of the leachi ng conditions used, gold recoveries of 
between 70% and 80% were obtained which co mpare less favourably with 92% from 
cyanidation. Large variations in the resi due gold assays indicated the presence of 
coarse gold and made it difficult for consis tent gold recovery data to be obtained. The 
thiosulfate leaching process seemed to be mo re affected by the “nugget effect” than 
cyanidation due to its intrinsic kinetic limitat ions. Therefore, for some ore types, more 
efficient leaching with the thiosulfate system requires finer grinding or longer leaching 
time than is normally required for the cy anide system. Thiosulfate consumption with Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
61 this ore was reasonably low, particularl y above pH 7 (about 3 kg/t at 50% solids 
density).  The cyanidation of Ore Sample C ore prod uced 62% gold recovery while the yields 
from thiosulfate leaching were between 40 and 50%. With finer grin ding the rate of 
thiosulfate leaching was much improved and 69% recovery was achieved under these conditions. Thiosulfat e consumption with this ore was much higher than with 
the oxide ore due to its high sulfide content. In addition, the thiosulfate consumption 
increased significantly with finer milling bec ause of the increased surface area of the 
sulfides. The preferred pH for the leac hing was 7-7.5 to mi nimise thiosulfate 
consumption.  Initial thiosulfate leaching tests on Ore Sa mple D gave over 90% gold recovery which 
is comparable to the results of cyanidation.  However, further tests suffered from poor 
reproducibility and this probl em did not appear to be due to the “nugget effect” but 
rather related to an unexplai ned reduction in the initial leac hing kinetics. Further work 
is needed to fully understand this behaviour. Thiosulfate consumption with this ore 
decreased significantly with increasing pH. T he preferred pH for leaching was 7.5 at 
which value thiosulfate consumption (1.5 kg/t) and the formation of polythionates was 
minimised.  
 
Leaching tests carried out using Ore Sample  E demonstrated that similar gold 
recovery (~70%) and leaching kinetics could be achieved with the TS-Tu-FeEDTA process, as compared with t he conventional ammonium thio sulfate leaching process. 
However, the carbonaceous materials in the ore appeared to accele rate the oxidation 
of thiosulfate. By adding 5% kerosene to the thiosulfate leach system to deactivate 
the carbonaceous material, a gold recovery  of 70% was achieved. The addition of 
kerosene also resulted in a decrease in the thiosulfate consumption, from 20 kg/t to 
12 kg/t.  Test work with Ore Sample F yielded com parable gold recoveries with thiosulfate 
leaching and CIL cyanidation ( 48% vs. 45%). Only the fr ee gold was leached in each 
case. The leaching was completed within one hour indicating th at the free gold was 
extremely fine. Thiosulfate c onsumption was very high wit h this ore (up to 20 kg/t) 
due to the combined catalytic effects of su lfides and carbonaceous materials on the 
oxidation of thiosulfate. However, the consumption wa s greatly reduced when the 
leaching time was limited to 1 hour.         Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
62 5. GOLD RECOVERY USING ION EXCHANGE RESINS 
Since ion exchange is the most probable met hod of recovering gold from thiosulfate 
leaching solutions, it is important to obtai n understanding of the adsorption of gold on 
to ion exchange resins. Some fundamental work has been done for the ion exchange 
process associated with the conventional thiosu lfate leaching process in the previous 
P420B project. Although this was aimed at the thiosulf ate-copper-ammonia leaching 
system, most of the fundament al findings are applicable to the thiosulfate-Tu-
FeEDTA system. For example, the greatest pr oblem in the applicatio n of resins is the 
presence of tetra- and tri-thionates which are detrimental to the loading of gold. 
These species are expected to be presen t in the new leaching system as well. 
However, the new thiosulfate process is diff erent in that the leaching pH is lower and 
the solution contains thiourea and FeEDTA. Therefore, the work reported here is 
mainly concerned with specific issues aris ing from the differenc es between the two 
leaching systems.   Table 15 lists some of the important properties of the re sins selected for the current 
work. Amberjet 4200 was obtained from Rohm &Haas while the other resins were 
provided by Lanxess. Amberjet 4200 was found to  be the most suitable resin in the 
previous research. Lewatit K6267 and K63 67 are two newly developed resins with 
larger bead sizes which are particularly su itable for RIP purposes . Lewatit MP 64 is a 
weak base resin which can be used at pH values below about 8.

5.1 Experimental 
The ion exchange experiments using synthetic  solutions were conducted in 250 mL 
conical flasks placed on a rotary shaker. T he flasks were sealed with Parafilm to 
prevent loss of solution through evaporati on. For kinetic tests, samples were 
withdrawn intermittently and analysed for gold,  while for isotherm measurements only 
the samples at equilibrium were taken. T he gold loading on the resins was then Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
63 determined by the differences between the in itial and final gold concentrations in the 
solution.   Commercially available ion exchange resins we re treated by soaking overnight,  and 
then filtered with a Buckner funnel under vacuum  until the resin beads were easily 
separated without visible liquid water. The resins were then stored in sealed bottles 
for later use.  The weak base resin was conver ted to the chloride form by mixing 300 g resin with 1 
L HCl (about 1.3 M) and bottle rolling overnight. After decantation of the acid, the 
resin was washed with deionized water a few times until the pH of the filtrate was 
neutral after which the resin beads were vacuum dried.  The leaching of gold ores was carried out in  stirred reactors. The pH was controlled 
by automatic titration with sulfuric acid. The concentration of dissolved oxygen was 
recorded using an YSI 5739 probe coupled with an YSI 52 Dissolved Oxygen Meter 
or a TPS WP-91 Dissolved Oxygen-pH Meter. The solu tion potential (Eh) was 
measured with a platinum wire against a refe rence electrode. Samples were taken at 
different times during the leach period and the concentrations of gold and iron were 
determined by commercial laboratories using ICP-MS and ICP-AES, respectively. 
The concentration of thiosulfate wa s determined by iodometric titration. 
 A stock solution of the Fe-EDTA comp lex (0.05 M Fe) wa s prepared using 
Fe(NO
3)3.9H 2O and Na 2EDTA in a 1:1.1 molar ratio. Th e solution, adjusted to pH 6.5 
with sodium hydroxide, has a cherry red colour and is st able on storage. To start a 
leaching test, a known amount of the Fe-E DTA stock solution was added to the 
leaching solution (or slurry) cont aining thiosulfate and thiourea. 
 Electrochemical studies were carried out using the conventional three-electrode 
system. The working electrode was normally a rotating gold disc electrode and the counter electrode a platinum wire. Eit her a Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) or a Hg/Hg
2SO 4 (sat. 
K2SO 4) was used as the reference electrode,  but all potentials  are reported with 
respect to standard hydrogen electrode (SHE ). The solution was de-aerated with 
pure nitrogen prior to each ex periment, except in the cases where dissolved oxygen 
was required for the experim ents. All the solutions for the electrochemical 
measurements were prepared with Mill i-Q Millipore water and a supporting 
electrolyte (eg, 0.2 M K 2SO 4) was normally used.  
 
5.2 Results and Discussion 
5.2.1 Kinetics of Gold Loading The results of kinetic tests for the loadin g of gold on to various resins from gold 
solutions containing about 0.1 M thiosulfate are presented in Figure 26. As can be Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
64 seen, the loading process was fast with equ ilibrium being reached within 5 hours in 
most cases. In the case of K6367, the load ing was somewhat slower  but it is believed 
that equilibrium would be reached after 24 hours, given the sm all change in gold 
concentration after 5 hours. For this reas on all the subsequent equilibrium loading 
tests were run for 24 hours.

5.2.2 Equilibrium Gold Loading 
In Figure 27 the isotherms for the equilibr ium loading of gold on to various resins 
from 0.1 M thiosulfate solu tions are presented. Simila r curves were obtained for 
Amberjet 4200 and Lewatit K6367, which gave the highest loading followed by K6267 
and MP64. As MP64 is a weak base resin,  an isotherm was also measured using the 
free base form for comparison with the Cl- form. As can be seen, the loading was 
much lower on the free base form. It was f ound that the pH of the loading solutions 
with the free base form increased from 6 at the beginning to above 9, which 
exceeded the normal operation pH range  of the resin. Obviously, OH- ion was 
released from the resin into the solution as gold was loaded. This caused the pH to 
rise and inhibited further gold loading. In the case of the Cl- form of MP64, the pH of 
the loading solution dropped by about 1 pH unit, probably due to the residual HCl in 
the resin as a result of conversion  from the free base from to the Cl- form. With all the 
strong base resins the pH changes in t he loading solutions were not significant.

 Despite the differences in their loading is otherm, all the resins (including the Cl
- form 
of MP64) were able to effectively adsor b gold in the absence of other competing 
anions.   
5.2.3 Effect of Thiourea 
Each curve in Figure 27 has a solid symbol  which represents a data point obtained in 
the presence of 10 mM thiourea. As clear ly demonstrated by these data points, the 
presence of thiourea did not affect gold lo ading on any of the ion exchange resins. 
This result is not unexpected, because thio urea is a neutral molecule over a wide pH 
range and so should not be expected to adsorb.  
5.2.4 Effect of Thiosulfate Concentration 
Figure 28 shows the effect of thiosulfate concentration on the equilibrium loading of 
gold. With 0.01 M thiosulfate, a very st eep isotherm is obtained with the gold loading 
reaching 30 g/L at an equilibrium gold concent ration of 0.1 ppm. As the concentration 
of thiosulfate increased, gold loading was substantia lly reduced and with 0.3 M 
thiosulfate, the gold loading was suppressed even further.

 The trend shown in these results is consis tent with that reported previously. In 
general, the presence of thiosulfate is not as  detrimental as tetra- and tri-thionates. 
However, as the concentration of thiosu lfate used in the th iosulfate-Tu-FeEDTA 
leaching process is relatively high (up to 0.3 M), its negative effect on gold loading 
cannot be neglected.  
5.2.5 Effect of FeEDTA 
The effect of FeEDTA on gold loading on Amberjet 4200 is shown in Figure 29 in 
which isotherms obtained in the absence a nd presence of FeEDTA and thiourea are 
compared. In the presence of 3 mM FeED TA, the gold loading dropped slightly 
particularly at higher gold concentrations. No additive effect was evident when both 
FeEDTA and thiourea were present.  Similar results have also been obtained for K6267 and MP64 (Figure 30), which 
confirms that FeEDTA at a concentration of 3 mM had only  a very slightly negative 
effect on the gold loading. Thiourea at a co ncentration of 10 mM does not affect the 
ion exchange process whether or not FeEDTA is present.  For all the tests above involving FeEDTA , the total iron concentrations were 
monitored and no measurable changes were observed, suggesting that the slight 
decrease in gold loading in the presence of FeEDTA was not due to competitive 
loading of iron. Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology

5.2.6 Loading of Ir on on the Resins 
In order to investigate the ion exchange beha viour of the FeEDTA complex, solutions 
containing only 3 mM FeEDTA were first us ed in loading tests with various resins. 
The tests were conducted at pH values of 5.9, 7.0 and 8.1,  as a change in the 
coordination of the complex was expected in this pH r ange. It can be seen from the 
results shown in Figure 31 that the iron load ings were generally lo w (below 5 g/L) at 
approximately pH 6. For all the resins except MP64, the ir on loading increased 
slightly as the pH increased to 7 while a substantial increas e to above 15 g/L was 
observed at pH 8. Corresponding to the increasing pH, the colour of the loaded 
resins changed from pale pink to pink and then red, indicating increasing amounts of 
iron on the resins.

Figure 31.  Effect of pH  on the Loading of FeEDTA on Various Ion Exchange 
Resins (0.65 mL/L) from Solutions  Containing 3 mM FeEDTA at 25 °C. 
 
 The very low iron loadi ng at the lower pH su ggests that a predomin ant fraction of the 
FeEDTA complex is neutral in charge in this  pH range. This is  different from the 
expression of EDTA as Y
4- found in most text books. Further work is necessary to 
resolve this which is not within the scope of the current work.  
 
It is known that FeEDTA coordinates with hy droxide ion at pH va lues around 7. This 
is consistent with the observati on that the colour of a d ilute FeEDTA solution turned 
from yellow to orange as the pH increased to above 7. Assuming FeEDTA is neutral 
at lower pH, the reaction is likely to proceed according to Equation (14) (Section 3.2.5) in which the resulting ferric comp lex is negatively charged. This may explain 
the loading behaviour of FeEDTA at differ ent pH values. At pH 6, most of the Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
69 complex was present as neutra l species and the l oading was low. At pH 7, some of 
the complex was negatively ch arged and the loading increased.  At pH 8, most of the 
complex was converted to the negatively c harged species and, therefore, the loading 
increased significantly.  In the case of resin MP64, the pH of th e loading solutions dropped to 4.1, 5.5 and 
7.1, respectively due to the residual HCl in  the resin as mentioned previously. As a 
result, the iron loading remained low in all the tests.   Further tests to investigate the loading of FeEDTA were conducted in the presence of 
thiosulfate and the results are presented in Table 16. For all the resins and at all the 
pH values tested, the load ing of iron became very low in the presence of 0.1 M 
thiosulfate (<2 g/L). Considering that th e changes of iron concentrations in the 
solutions were largely within the error range of the analytical method (AAS), the 
loading of iron was practically  negligible. These results s uggest that the adsorption of 
FeEDTA on the resins was very weak, ev en at high pH values  where the complex 
was possibly negatively charged.

5.2.7 Prelimin ary RIP Tests 
Given the promising results for gold loading from synthetic solutions, it was decided 
to carry out some preliminary resin in pul p (RIP) tests using Ore Sample A prepared 
for the previous leaching optimisation te sts. Three tests were conducted and the 
leaching conditions for Test 1 and Test 2 were: 0.15 M thiosulfate, 15 mM thiourea, 3 Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
70 mM FeEDTA, 35% pulp density, pH 7.5 and 30 °C. A relatively high pH was selected 
to minimise oxidation of thiosulfate and the formation of polythionates. Resins were 
then added to the slurry after leaching at a concentration of 1 mL/L (Amberjet 4200 
for Test 1 and Lewatit K6367 for Test 2) fo r 8 hours. After RIP, the resins were 
screened (425 µm), washed and dried. The gold on th e resin was analysed by ashing 
and digestion with aqua regia followed by AAS for comparison with the results from 
solution analysis.   From Figure 32 it can be seen that the l eaching results agree well with those 
obtained in the previ ous optimisation tests under sim ilar conditions, with 82% gold 
leached, yielding a pregnant so lution of 0.5-0.6 ppm gold. After the addition of the 
resin, the gold concentration in solution dr opped rapidly in the first hour. The loading 
then slowed down and, after 8 hours, up to  half of the loaded gold was released back 
into the solution. It is likely that the loaded gold was replaced by polythionates 
present in the solution. The total c oncentrations of polythionates as S
4O6, estimated 
from the loss of thiosulfate, were 6.7 mM fo r Test 1 and 8.5 mM for Test 2. The gold 
concentration on the resins was only about  100 mg/L, for which solution and resin 
analyses gave reasonably consistent results.

 The thiosulfate concentration was reduced to  0.1 M and thiourea to 10 mM in Test 3 
in order to reduce the formation of polythi onates. Again, satisfactory leaching was 
achieved and the estimated tota l polythionate concentration as S
4O6 was reduced to 
4.5 mM. In this case, three aliquots of 1 mL/L of Lewatit K6367 resin were added Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
71 each time. As the loaded gold may be r eplaced by polythionates in extended 
resin/solution contact, the retent ion time was reduced to 2-3 hours. 
 The results in Figure 33 show th at the first aliquot of resi n resulted in a decrease in 
gold concentration from 0.52 to about 0.25 ppm, which decr eased further to 0.1 ppm 
with the addition of the second aliquot. Surprising ly, when the third aliquot was 
added, the gold concentration increased again. This result is improbable because the 
loaded resin in each batch was removed be fore the next batch was added. The gold 
loadings from resin assays were 160, 5 and 11 mg/L, respectively. The total gold on resin was consistent with the overall removal of gold from the soluti on. Therefore, it is 
most likely that the analyses of the inte rmittent solution samples were incorrect.

 In general, the preliminar y RIP tests indicated that the l oading of gold from the leach 
solutions was less effective than from the synthetic solutions previously used. The 
leach solutions differ from the synthetic so lution mainly in the low gold concentration 
(0.5 ppm) and the polythionate content. In  order to better understand the behaviour 
of gold loading from real leach solutions , further experiments were carried out using 
synthetic solutions contai ning low gold concentrations and various levels of 
tetrathionate.  
5.2.8 Gold Loading from Synthetic Leach Solutions 
The synthetic solutions contained 0.15 M thiosulfate, 15 mM thiourea, 3 mM 
FeEDTA, 0.5-1 ppm Au and 0-6 mM tetrathi onate at pH 7.5. Figure 34 shows the Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
72 gold loading on various resins from such so lutions with different concentrations of 
tetrathionate. Without tetr athionate, a reas onable gold loading of  about 1 g/L was 
achieved on all the resins. As the tetrat hionate concentration increased from 1 mM to 
6 mM, the gold loadi ng dropped significantly by up to 80%. These results further 
confirm the significant competit ive adsorption of polythionates.

 It is well known that polythionates are not st able in alkaline soluti ons and, therefore, 
some loading experiments were conducted to investigate the effe ct of pH on gold 
loading from synthetic solutions containi ng 3 mM tetrathionate a nd 0.4 ppm gold. The 
results of these experiments are presented in Figure 35. Unfortunately, no effect was 
evident in the pH range of 6.5-8.5 suggesting that the stabi lity of polythionates is 
reduced only at higher pH values.  The combination of the presence of polythio nates and very low concentration of gold 
in the leach solutions from Ore Sample A makes experim ental evaluation of the RIP 
process difficult due to the relatively large error in gold analysis. Therefore, it was 
decided to investigate the leac hing of other ores in order to find a suitable sample for 
RIP test work.      Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology

5.2.9 Gold Loading from Ore Sample D Leach Solution 
Pregnant solutions containing higher gold concentrations were obtained from the 
earlier leaching test work on Ore Sample D (Section 4.2.5 – Test s 19, 20, 21 and 22). 
Leaching was performed at pH 7.5 to minimise the formation of polythionates as 
discussed above. After leaching, the soluti ons were separated from the solids by 
filtration and then shaken with resin in 500 mL conical fl asks which were sealed with 
Parafilm to prevent loss of solution. Tw o resins, Lewatit MP 6367 and Amberjet 4200 
which were found to give the most promising results, were used for the loading tests. 
Each test involved 3 co-current batch addi tions of resin with a new batch added after 
the loaded resin was filtered from the previous contac t. The loading kinetics were 
followed during the first addition of resin wh ile in subsequent contacts, only the final 
gold concentration was analysed.  The results obtained with solutions from Te sts 19 and 20 are shown in Figure 36. 
The concentration of thiosulfate used in th ese tests was 0.2 M. In the first addition, 
the gold loading reached a maximum after about  3 hours and then decreased slightly 
due to competitive adsorption of polythionates. Gold was effectively removed from 
solution in each round and after 3 additions t he remaining gold in solution was only 
0.2 ppm. A reasonable gold load ing of 600 mg/L was achieved. The results obtained 
for the two resins we re very similar.

Solutions Using MP 6367 (Test 19, left ) and Amberjet 4200 (Test 20, right). 
 
 In Tests 21 and 22 the first resin contact wa s carried out for only 5 hours. The overall 
results, shown in Figure 37, were similar to those from Tests 19 and 20 except that 
the maximum achievable gold loading was lower (500 mg/L) and the residual gold in 
solution was higher (0.5 ppm). This ca n be attributed to the higher thiosulfate 
concentration used during leaching (0.3 M) and al so higher levels of polythionates as 
a result of increased th iosulfate consumption. 
 It appears from these tests that the recovery of gold from leaching solutions using ion 
exchange resins is promising if the concent rations of polythionates can be minimised 
during the leaching.

75 5.3 Conclusions 
The recovery of gold using ion exchange resi ns from thiosulfate-Tu-FeEDTA leaching 
solutions has been studied. With synthetic solutions, gold was effectively loaded on 
to the resins. Weak base resins could be used because of the neutral pH of the leaching system. Of the resins tested,  Amberjet 4200 and Lewat it K6367 gave the 
highest gold loading, followed by Lewatit K6267 and Lewati t MP64. The gold loading 
was negatively affected by thiosulfate and, more strongly, by the tetrathionate and 
other polythionates. Thiourea  did not interfere with t he ion exchange process 
because it is a neutral species. FeEDTA di d not adsorb on the resins under leaching 
conditions (neutral pH and high thiosulfate concentration) and so had no significant 
effect on gold loading. Pre liminary RIP tests have been  conducted with Ore Sample 
A but, due to the very low gold concentration in the slurry, the gold loading on the resins was not very satisfactory.   
Ion exchange tests were then conducted on solutions from the leaching of Ore 
Sample D and the results were more promising. As a result  of the minimisation of the 
concentrations of polythionates by operation at  pH 7.5 during leaching, gold could be 
effectively removed from the pregnant solu tions after 3 successive contacts with 
fresh resin and gold loadings on the resins  of 500-600 mg/L could be achieved.  
 
6. ALTERNATIVE CATALYSTS AND OXIDANTS 
The main problems with the Th iosulfate-Tu-FeEDTA proce ss are the high cost of 
EDTA and the health issues  associated with the use of thiourea, which is a 
suspected carcinogen. Therefore, one of the objectives of the project was to 
investigate the use of alternative catal ysts and oxidants. In this area of work, 
fundamental studies were carried out to investigate the cata lytic and oxidising 
properties of some candidate compounds using electrochemical techniques and 
leaching studies.   In the search for suitable catalysts for gold oxidation, compounds that have 
similarities to thiourea (Tu) were consid ered in the first instance. These included 
urea, dithio-oxamide, cysteine and sodium  ethyl xanthate. The results of 
electrochemical studies on these compounds have been r eported elsewhere. In the 
current work, another thiourea-like compound,  thiosemicarbazide (Tsc), was selected 
and its effect on gold oxidation was invest igated using electrochemical techniques. 
Substituted anthraquinones, the complexes of ferric and nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), 
and MnEDTA were assessed as alternat ive oxidants. The efficacy of these 
compounds was further evaluated by leac hing of a gold ore on the basis of the 
existing TS-Tu-FeEDTA system, i. e. by replacing either th e catalyst or the oxidant. 
The leaching conditions were selected based on the understanding of the TS-Tu-
FeEDTA system and the detailed results are presented in this report.  Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology

6.1.1 Electroche mical Studies 
Electrochemical studies were carried out using the conventional three-electrode 
system. The working electrode is normally a rotating disc electrode and the counter 
electrode a platinum wire.  Either a Ag/AgCl (s at. KCl) or a Hg/Hg 2SO 4 (sat. K 2SO 4) 
was used as the reference el ectrode, but all potentials ar e reported with respect to 
standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). The solu tion was de-aerated with pure nitrogen 
prior to each experiment, except in the case  of oxygen reduction where the solution 
was saturated with air or pur e oxygen. All the solutions  for the electrochemical 
measurements were prepared with Mill i-Q Millipore water and a supporting 
electrolyte (eg, 0.2 M K 2SO 4) was normally used.  
 
6.1.2 Dissolution of Pure Gold 
The dissolution of pure gold in thiosulfate solutions was conducted using a rotating 
disc method, in which the same set-up as for the electrochemical studies was 
employed. A large gold disc (9  mm diameter except in one case for which a 17 mm 
disc was used) rotating at 400 rpm was im mersed in 100 mL solution de-aerated with 
pure nitrogen for a certain period of time. T he dissolution was carried out at the open 
circuit potential. The dissolution rate wa s calculated from the amount of gold 
dissolved as analysed by AAS or ICP-O ES, the electrode area and the dissolution 
time.   6.1.3 Preparation and Char acterisation of Ore 
Ore Sample D was re-ground to 100% less than 90 µm. The chemical composition of 
the ore is given in Table 7. 
 
6.1.4 Leaching 
The leaching experiments were conducted for 24 hours at ambient temperature (22-
23 °C) in 1 L beakers with the slurries agitat ed using overhead stirrers at a speed of 
250 rpm. In each experiment, 400 g of ore was mixed with deioni sed water and then 
the solid reagents were dissolved. Leaching commenced when an oxidant solution 
was added. The volumes of the DI water and the oxidant were pre-calculated to 
make up a total volume of 600 mL of the leach solution with the pulp density being 
40% (w/v). The pH of the solutions was maintained by dosing with H
2SO 4 (1.012 M) 
using Metrohm 776 Dosimat automatic titrat ors controlled by a Hinco DT50 Datataker 
via a custom-written program. During leaching,  the Eh of the solu tions was measured 
intermittently with an Ionode Pt redox electr ode and the dissolved oxygen levels were 
measured with a Syland Model 4000 DO meter. Samples we re withdrawn and filtered 
at different time intervals, with the so lutions collected for analysis and the solids Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
77 returned to the leach. To determine the exac t volume of the final  leach solution, the 
total mass of the slurry was weighed befor e pressure filtration, the leach residue 
dried at 60 °C and the weight recorded, and the dens ity of the solution measured by 
accurately weighing 10.00 mL of the filtrate.  
 
6.1.5 Reagents and Solutions 
All chemicals used were analytical grad e reagents and all solu tions were made up 
with deionised water. The source of thiosulfate was Na 2S2O3.5H 2O for all the 
experiments. 
 
A stock solution of 0.05 M FeEDTA wa s prepared using solutions of Fe(NO 3)3.9H 2O 
and Na 2EDTA.2H 2O, the latter being first dissolved wi th a specified amount of NaOH. 
The pH of the stock solution was 6.5.  
 
The Fe-NTA complex solutions were prepared freshly before each leaching 
experiment by mixing solutions of 0.1 M FeCl 3 and 0.1 M NTA at t he proportions of 1: 
1.5, 1:2 and 1:2.5 in order to obtain different combinations of two possible 
complexes, FeNTA and Fe(NTA) 2. The dissolution of NTA was facilitated by adding 
NaOH to raise the pH to 11.8.  
 
6.1.6 Analysis 
The analysis of gold and iron was undertaken by a commercial laboratory, 
UltraTrace. Gold in the residues was de termined by standard fire assay. Gold and 
iron in solution were determined by IC P-MS and ICP-OES, respectively.  
 
The concentrations of thiosu lfate and polythionat es were analysed at CSIRO using a 
Waters 2695 HPLC separation module. The separation of thiosulfate and 
polythionates were effected using a Di onex IonPac AS16 ion exchange column 
equipped with an IonPac AG16 guard column. The mobile phase was a solution of 
0.2 M or 0.125 M sodium perchlorate  at a flowrate of 1 mL min-1. All analytes were 
detected using UV with a Waters 2996 Phot odiode Array Detector. The wavelengths 
used were 192 nm (trithionate), 214 nm (thi osulfate, tetrathionat e, pentathionate and 
hexathionate) and 235 nm (Tu and Tsc). 0.2 M perchlorate was used for the analysis 
of polythionates, particularly hexathionate which had a much longer retention time 
than other species. As the concentration of  thiosulfate was much higher, the analysis 
of thiosulfate was conducted separately after dilution and 0.125 M perchlorate was 
used to obtained better separation from Tu (or Tsc).

78 6.2 Results and Discussion 
6.2.1 A New Catalyst for Gold Oxidation Figure 38 shows the electrochemical oxidati on of gold in 0.1 M thiosulfate solution 
with and without additives. Th e dotted line represents a solution containing only 
thiosulfate. The oxidation of gold comm enced at about 0.1 V which was obviously 
hindered because the anodic current remained very low as the electrode potential 
increased until about 0.4 V where thiosulfate was rapidly oxidised. The presence of 
10 mM Tu significantly accelerated gold oxidation as demonstrated by the 
exponential increase in the anodic current with increasing potential. This was the 
means by which Tu was origina lly identified as a catalyst for gold oxidation. Figure 38 
shows that the presence of Tsc has a similar effect to that of Tu as the two oxidation 
curves are almost identical. Therefore, T sc is expected to be an effective catalyst for 
gold oxidation in thiosulfate solutions.

6.2.2 Investigation of  Alternative Oxidants 
One group of possible alternative oxi dants considered was the substituted 
anthraquinones. 9,10-anthr aquinone-2,6-disulfonat e (AQ-2,6) and 9,10-
anthraquinone-2-sulfonate (AQ- 2) have been used as redox catalysts for the removal 
of metallic iron from reduced ilmenites. It was proposed that the reversible 
electrochemistry of these compounds is res ponsible for their catalytic activity during 
aeration. The redox couples of these reagents provide an additional electron 
transport mechanism between the dissolved ox ygen and the metal lic iron wherein the 
oxidised forms oxidise the metallic iron, an d the reduced forms are oxidised by the 
dissolved oxygen. While anthr aquinones are well know n organic oxidants, the Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
79 standard potentials of these two specific co mpounds were not foun d. Therefore, it 
was decided to investigate the redox properties of the compounds using cyclic 
voltammetry to determine if they are suitabl e oxidants for the leaching of gold in the 
thiosulfate system. As it was expected that  the two substituted anthraquinones would 
have similar standard potentials, only one, AQ -2,6, was selected for this study. Its 
structural formula is as follows:  
O
OSO3
O3SO

A cyclic voltammogram (CV) of AQ-2,6 is shown in Fi gure 39. The potential scan 
commenced from the rest potentia l in the negative direction.  A peak for the reduction 
of AQ-2,6 to the corre sponding hydrogen anthraquinone (H 2AQ-2,6) was observed in 
the forward scan and, in the reverse scan, a peak for the re-oxidation of the reduced 
form. This is a typical reversible process and the reaction can be represented as:   AQ  +  2H
+  +  2e    '    H 2A Q       ( 1 5 )

 The half wave potential, E
1/2, which is a good approximati on of the redox potential at 
the given pH, was then determined from the peak potentials to be –0.17 V. Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
80 Unfortunately, this potentia l is not high enough for gold leaching. To oxidise gold 
effectively in a thiosulfate solution, a standar d potential of greater than about 0.1 V is 
required, even in the presenc e of the thiourea catalyst. 
 The ferric EDTA complex has been demonstra ted to be a promising oxidant for gold 
leaching in the thiosulfate system. Like EDTA, nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) is a 
commonly used ligand which forms chelat e complex with Fe(II) and Fe(III). The 
structural formula of NTA is as follows:  
 
 
According to the literature, both Fe(II) and Fe(III) form complexes with one or two 
molecules of NTA, i.e.,   Fe
IINTA   log K 1 = 8.90     (16) 
 FeII(NTA) 2   log K 2 = 11.98    (17) 
 FeIIINTA   log K 1 = 15.9     (18) 
 FeIII(NTA) 2   log K 2 = 24.0     (19) 
 Using the above stability cons tant values, the standard potent ials of the redox couples 
Fe
IIINTA / FeIINTA and FeIII(NTA) 2 / FeII(NTA) 2 are calculated to be 0.36 and 0.06 V, 
respectively. If these values are correct, it would be quite possi ble for the ferric NTA 
complexes to oxidise gold. Therefore, work was carried out to investigate the 
electrochemical reduction of these comple xes. In the following text, the symbol Fe-
NTA will be used for the general ferric NT A complexes, while FeNTA and Fe(NTA) 2 
will be used for the spec ific ferric complexes. 
 The solutions of Fe-NTA were prepared from Fe(NO
3)3.9H 2O and NTA with Fe:NTA 
ratios of 1:1.1, 1:2.1 and 1:3. The first solution presumably contained mainly FeNTA 
and the other two solutions, Fe(NTA) 2. The dissolution of NTA was assisted by adding 
an appropriate amount of sodium  hydroxide to neutralise the acid whose solubility in 
water is limited. It was found that the solu tion with FeNTA was slightly turbid and a 
brown precipitate formed on storage,  while the others with Fe(NTA) 2 were clear and 
more stable. All the solutions were brown in colour, similar to FeEDTA. 
 The CVs of Fe-NTA obtained in neutral soluti ons are given in Figure 40. The CV of 
FeEDTA is also shown for comparison. As can be seen, the redox reaction of the 
Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple was quite reversible with an Fe/NTA ratio of 1:3 (though not as Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
81 reversible as the FeEDTA complex, indi cated by the larger  separation of the 
oxidation/reduction peaks) . When the ratio was changed to 1:2.1, the reaction 
became less reversible as the peak separati on increased. With the 1:1.1 ratio, the 
peaks were separated even further and, moreov er, some waves seemed to arise prior 
to the main peaks suggesting changes in t he reaction mechanisms. The estimated 
redox potential for the reduction of Fe(NTA) 2 is around 0 V, which is in good 
agreement with the calcul ated value. In the case of FeNTA, however, estimation 
could not be made because of the large peak separation and lack of understanding of 
the reactions.

M K 2SO 4 as Background Electrolyte. Scan Rate: 100 mV/s. 
 
 To investigate the reduction of the Fe-NTA  complexes further, t he technique of linear 
sweep voltammetry (LSV) was used, in whic h the gold disc electrode was rotated and 
the potential scan was made much  more slowly at 1 mV/s. In this case, the current 
recorded represents (or approximates) the st eady state reaction rate and thus is 
closer to what will happen in  a real leaching process. The results so obtained are 
shown in Figure 41.  As can be seen from Figure 41 , in all cases the reduction of the Fe-NTA complexes 
commenced at potentials simila r to that of FeEDTA. However, as the potentials 
became more negative, the increase in reduct ion current was significantly slower for 
all the Fe-NTA complexes than for FeED TA, suggesting the reduction of the former Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
82 on a gold surface was less effective than the latter. Neverthel ess, up to 0.5 A/m2 
current density could be obt ained between 0.15 to 0.2 V, which is normally the range 
of mixed potentials for the thiourea-catal ysed thiosulfate leaching system. This current 
density, therefore, represent s a reasonable rate of gold leaching. In addition, the 
reduction of FeNTA gave a hi gher current than Fe(NTA) 2 at potentials more positive 
than about 0 V. This is in li ne with the expectation that the oxidant is more aggressive 
with less NTA because of the lower stability of Fe(III).

 Given the above information, it was deci ded to measure the rate of pure gold 
dissolution to further evaluate the possibilit y of using Fe-NTA as a potential oxidant 
(Section 6.2.3).  Some metals like manganese have multiple oxidative states. In the presence of a 
strong ligand some normally unstable oxi dative states may be stabilised, thus 
forming useful oxidants. Based on this c onsideration, the cyc lic voltammetry of 
Mn(II)-EDTA complex was studied in a wide potential range in order  to identify any 
possible oxidising species.   The Mn(II)-EDTA complex was prepar ed by mixing solutions of MnCl
2 and disodium 
EDTA at a molar ratio of 1:1.05. A CV  of this complex obtained on a gold disc 
electrode is shown in Figure 42. As ca n be seen, the potential scan was made 
initially in the positive direct ion from the rest potential. A reversible redox reaction 
was observed with an oxidation peak at 0.90 V and a reduction peak at 0.77 V. It is Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
83 believed that the peaks were due to the ox idation of Mn(II) to Mn(III) and its 
subsequent reduction back to Mn(II), given t he following data found in the literature: 
  Mn
IIEDTA   log K = 7.27     (20) 
 MnIIIEDTA   log K = 20.25     (21) 
 The Mn(III) is well stabilised by EDTA and  so may be used as an oxidant. However, 
the high redox potential of the Mn(II)/Mn(III) couple (E
1/2 = 0.84 V) indicates that it is 
not suitable for gold leaching in thiosulf ate solutions, as the thiosulfate will be 
oxidised very rapidly at potentia ls greater than about 0.4 V.

6.2.3 Dissolution Rates of Pure Gold 
A convenient way of assessi ng the performance of a leac hing system is to measure 
the rate of gold dissolution us ing a rotating gold disc. In t he current work this method 
was used to evaluate the performances  of Fe-NTA oxidants in the S 2O3/Tu system. 
Similarly, the new catalyst, Tsc, was ev aluated with FeEDTA as the oxidant. The 
results are presented in Table 17, along with the earlier result for the TS-Tu-FeEDTA 
system for comparison.  It can be seen from Table 17 that, with Tu as the catalyst, Fe(NTA)
2 at the ratio 1:2.1 
gave a gold dissolution rate of 6.0 x 10-3 mol m-2 h-1, which is comparable to that 
obtained with FeEDTA. With an increase of NT A to the ratio of 1:3, the rate dropped 
by more than half. This is likely to be due to  over-stabilisation of the ferric by the Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
84 additional NTA which made the complex less oxidising. In the case of FeNTA where 
the ferric was less stable, the highes t dissolution rate was obtained.

solutions using various catalysts and oxidants (pH 6–7, 25 °C, 400 rpm)

0.1 M S 2O3-10 mM Tsc-2 mM FeEDTA (7 hr)  6.4 x 10-3 
 
With Tsc as the catalyst and FeEDTA as the oxidant, the dissolu tion rate obtained 
was 6.4 x 10-3 mol m-2 h-1, which is very similar to that obtained with Tu . This result 
suggests that Tsc may be used as an alternativ e to Tu as a catalyst for gold leaching. 
 
6.2.4 Leaching of Gold Ore 
In total, 12 leaching experiments were cond ucted with two differ ent systems: the TS-
Tsc-FeEDTA system (Tsc system), and the TS-Tu-FeNTA system (NTA system). The 
leaching conditions for the Tsc system we re selected based on the understanding of 
the S 2O3-Tu-FeEDTA to investigate the effects of Tsc concentration and pH. For the 
NTA system, on the other hand, th ree different Fe:NTA ratios (1:1.5, 1:2 and 1:2.5) 
were used and in each case, two pH values  were tested. Progressively lower pH 
values were selected for lower concentrati ons of NTA, as the ferric ion was less 
stable with reducing proportions of NTA.  
 
The general results of these tests are pr esented in Table 18. Tests M1-M3 were 
conducted at pH 6.5 using 0.3 M thiosulf ate, 3 mM FeEDTA and 10-20 mM Tsc. The 
gold recoveries obtained were 69-83%, with the best result achieved at 15 mM Tsc. 
A similar trend in the leaching kinetics c an be seen from t he leaching profiles 
presented in Figure 43a. This trend is somew hat different from th e knowledge of the 
Tu system, in which case the gold re covery increased monotonically with Tu 
concentration up to 20 mM. It was observ ed that all leach solutions with 0.3 M 
thiosulfate became dark, with the colour deepening with increasing concentration of 
Tsc, indicating possible reactions involv ing thiosulfate and Tsc. This unknown 
chemistry may have a negative e ffect on the gold recovery. 
 Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
85 Tests M4-M6 were conducted with 0.2 M th iosulfate, 10 mM Tsc and 3 mM FeEDTA, 
to investigate the effect of pH. The dark ening of the leaching solutions was not 
observed, probably as a result  of reduced concentrations of  thiosulfate and Tsc. At 
pH 6.5 a high gold recovery of 91% wa s achieved (Table 18), which dropped quite 
significantly as the pH was increased to 7 and 7.5. A similar trend was observed for 
the leaching kinetics which is shown in Fi gure 43b. These results are not surprising 
because they are consistent with the behaviour  of the oxidant. As it has been shown 
in previous work, the reduction of FeEDTA  becomes less effective at pH values ≥ 7. 
Nevertheless, these results demonstrate that it is po ssible to achieve high gold 
recoveries with the Tsc system under proper conditions.

System. 
 
 From Table 18 it can be seen  that the gold recoveries obtained in the NTA system 
were generally lower than those from the Tsc system. The leaching curves for Tests 
N1-N6 are presented in Figure 44.  In Tests N1 (pH 5.5) and N2 (pH 6.0) the Fe:NTA ratio wa s 1:1.5. In this case the 
predominant oxidant would have been the FeNT A complex which was expected to be 
more aggressive than Fe(NTA)
2. Indeed, fast initial leaching rates were observed for 
N1 and N2. However, after 3 hours the leaching rates decreased significantly, 
particularly in the case of N1 with the fi nal gold recovery being only 58%. This may 
be attributed to the loss of the oxidant and will be discussed later. 
 With an Fe:NTA ratio of 1:2 (N3 and N4), the best results in  terms of leaching kinetics 
and gold recovery were obtained. The predominant oxidant was Fe(NTA)
2. The 
leaching performances were much the same  at pH 6 (N3) and pH 6.5 (N4) giving 
gold recoveries of 75 and 73%, respectively.  Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
87 When the ratio was changed to 1:2.5, the leaching kinetics decreased again and the 
gold recoveries dropped to 63 and 61% for N5 and N6, respectively. This is likely to 
be due to the over-stabilisation of the Fe(I II), the same effect as observed in the 
electrochemical studies. The apparent decr ease in leaching kinetics at pH 7 (N5) 
compared to pH 6.5 (N5) was similar to t he behaviour of FeEDTA, although the effect 
of pH on the reduction of Fe(NTA) 2 was not investigated.

Figure 44.  Profiles for th e Leaching of Ore Sample D with the TS–Tu–FeNTA 
System. 
 
 The changes in solution potentia ls (Eh) during the leaching tests are shown in Figure 
45. For Tests M1-M6, where the oxidant Fe EDTA was used, the potentials remained 
largely unchanged at about 200 mV throughout  the leaching. These results are 
consistent with previous work using FeEDTA.  On the other hand, the Eh of the NTA system  is dependent on the Fe:NTA ratio. At 
the ratio of 1:1.5 and a low pH value of 5.5, Test N1 showed a high initial Eh 
corresponding to the fast initial leaching rate  as shown in Figure 44. However, the Eh 
quickly dropped to 150 mV, at wh ich level the oxidat ion of gold woul d be expected to 
be ineffective. The drop of potential was mo st likely to be due to the oxidation of 
thiosulfate. Electrochemical studies have shown that the reduction of FeNTA is 
poorly reversible, therefore,  the Fe(II) generated could not be readily re-oxidised by 
dissolved oxygen (DO) and the Eh remained lo w during the rest of the leaching. With 
the same ratio but at a higher pH of 6.0 (T est N2), a drop in Eh was also obvious but 
the potential stayed at a reasonable level of 200 mV. This explains why the leaching 
slowed down but still continued (Figure 44).  Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology

 With the Fe:NTA ratios of 1:2 and 1:2.5, the Eh levels remained high and constant 
and, therefore, the leaching continued at reasonable rates after the initial stage. The 
oxidation of thiosulfate also  occurred but, because of the improved redox reversibility 
of Fe(NTA)
2 compared to FeNTA, the regeneration of Fe(III) by  (DO) was possible. A 
particular example is Test N6, where the in itial leaching rate was very slow due to 
over-stabilisation of the Fe(III), but th e leaching continued to surpass the 
performance of Test N1.  Attempts were made to analyse the total Fe  concentration in the leach solutions but 
the results were considered unreliable. Ir on precipitates appeared in the solution 
samples on storage, which was made worse by delays in analysis at the commercial 
analytical laboratory. Theref ore, it was decided not to try to interpret the Fe 
concentration data.  The data for thiosulfate consumption during the leaching tests ar e also included in 
Table 18. The relatively high thiosulfate co nsumptions are due to  oxidation catalysed 
by sulfide minerals (the ore contains 0.59% sulfide sulf ur). Assuming most of the 
products are polythionates, which is the ca se in neutral and weakly acidic solutions, Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
89 the oxidation of thiosulfate will result in continued increas e in the solution pH due to 
the reduction of DO:  
2S
2O32-  +  ½O 2  +  H 2O        S 4O62-  +  2OH-    ( 2 2 )  
 Further reactions of S
4O62- to give other polythionates usually do not have significant 
involvement of H+ or OH-. Therefore, if H 2SO 4 is used to maintain the leaching pH, 
the ratio of thiosulfate lost to H 2SO 4 consumed is expected to be 2. The measured 
S2O3:H2SO 4 ratios shown in Table 18 are genera lly smaller than 1, which indicates 
that the ore consumed acid.   As can be seen from Table 18 the thiosulf ate consumption decreased substantially 
with increasing pH. This trend is  consistent with the observ ations of sulfide minerals 
being less catalytic at higher pH values  and is independent of the catalysts and 
oxidants used. With 0.2 M thiosu lfate, the consumption of S
2O3 was typically more 
than 20 kg/t at pH<6.5, which reduced to 10-16 kg/t at pH 6.5 and only 4.4 kg/t at pH 
7.5. Thus, to optimise the leaching condition s one needs to consider the effect of pH 
on both leaching kinetics and thiosulfate consumption.  Though it was not clear wh ether the added Fe(III) oxi dants were involved in 
thiosulfate oxidation or not, it was obvious that the DO  was involved. Figure 46 
shows the concentrations of DO during the leaching test s. Comparing Figure 46 and 
Table 18, it is not difficult to find that the DO level was inversely related to thiosulfate 
consumption. Where th iosulfate consumptions were hi gh the DO levels were low due 
to fast reaction with thiosulfate, and vice versa.   Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology

A further 8 leaching tests (A-H) were t hen carried out under various conditions. One 
of the tests (E) was a re-leac h of the mixture of previous  leach residues from M1 and 
M3. In all tests cyanidation was performed fo llowing the thiosulfate leach using 1 g/L 
NaCN. The results are summarised in Table 19. 
 
Tests A and B were conducted with increased FeEDTA concen trations. In Test A, 5 
mM FeEDTA was used while in Test B, 3 mM was added initially and  an additional 3 
mM after 7 hours of leaching. It was expected that the results of these tests should 
be close to those of Test M4. In fact, t he leaching conditions of  Tests B and M4 were 
identical in the first 7 hours. Surprisingly,  gold recoveries obtained were very low - 
only 59.3 and 46.6% as compared to 91.1%. A ccordingly, thiosulfate consumption in 
these two tests was also very low (2.7 vs.  10.5 kg/t), indicating abnormal behaviour 
of the leaching system. However, t he reasons are not yet understood. 
 
Tests C and D were carried out using a hi gher concentration of  Tsc (15 mM) to 
examine the effect of pH on the stability of Tsc. Test D was a repetition of Test M2 
and the gold recoveries were reasonably close (75.9 vs. 83.4%) considering the Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
91 uncertainty caused by the decomposition of Tsc. The final solution of Test D was 
apparently darkened while that of Test C only darkened slig htly. The gold recovery 
from Test C (76.1%) was almost the same as from Test D, probably as a result of the 
combined effects of more stable Tsc but less effective oxidant (FeEDTA) at the 
higher pH. 
 
The re-leach (Test E) shows that thiosulf ate leaching was still effective on the leach 
residues with reasonable gold recovery. The generally lower efficiency of the 
thiosulfate leaching compared to cyanidati on was probably a result of the slower 
kinetics rather than passivation of the gol d surface. It has been shown in previous 
work that the leaching rate of the TS-T u-FeEDTA is about 10 times slower than that 
of cyanidation under oxygen di ffusion control. The kinetics of the Tsc system are 
expected to be, at best, similar to those of the Tu system. 
 
Test F was conducted to inve stigate the effect of increasing Tsc concentration on 
gold recovery. It can be seen by compari ng with Test M5 that the gold recovery 
dropped considerably when the Tsc concentra tion was increased from 10 mM to 15 
mM (68.9 vs. 83.9%). The large variation ma y be attributed to the uncertainty caused 
by the decomposition of Tsc, and is genera lly consistent with the previous results, 
e.g. Tests M1-M3, where higher c oncentrations of Tsc were used.

Tests G and H were conducted to invest igate the effect of phosphate on the 
thiosulfate consumption. Previous st udies with the TS-Tu-FeEDTA system have 
shown that the use of phosphate can signific antly reduce the oxidation of thiosulfate 
catalysed by sulfide minerals without affe cting gold leaching. A similar effect was 
observed for the TS-Tsc-FeEDTA system. With the addition of 20 mM phosphate, 
Test G showed a reduction of thiosulfate c onsumption to 4.28 kg/t from 10.5 kg/t in 
Test M4 while gold recovery remained essent ially the same (89.2 vs. 91.1%). In Test 
H, higher concentrations of TS and Tsc we re used, both were expected to increase 
thiosulfate oxidation, but t he thiosulfate loss could be maintained at a low level by 
increasing the pH to 7. The gold reco very, 82.4%, was also reasonably good. 
 
The thiosulfate consumpti on data in the other tests were generally in line with 
previous results, except Tests A and B for unknown reasons. Even in the re-leach 
test (E), a similar amount of  thiosulfate was consumed as in the first leach (e.g. 
comparing Tests E and M4). 
 
Cyanidation of the thiosulfat e leach residues was shown to  be highly efficient. The 
total gold recovery reached ≥97% in all tests except the re-leach. The residual gold 
after cyanidation was a consistent level of 0.1 g/t. 
 
6.2.5 Thiosulfate Oxidat ion and Sulfur Balance 
Polythionates were analysed by HPLC as qu ickly as possible during the tests, while 
thiosulfate in the final solution only wa s analysed using an eluant concentration 
method. Some sample chromatograms are provided in Figure 47. Figure 47a, 
obtained from the final solution of Test M4  diluted 20 times, represents the analysis 
of thiosulfate, while Figure 47b, from the final N4 samp le with 2 times dilution, 
corresponds to the analysis of polythionat es. For the Tsc system, the concentration 
of Tsc could not be determined due to interf erence of nitrate, which was introduced 
from the stock solution of FeEDTA. Thus it  was not possible to establish whether or 
not Tsc was stable during leaching. However,  it was found Tsc alone in pure solution 
was stable for at least 10 days without a ppreciable decomposition. For the NTA 
system, the HPLC peak for Tu could be s eparated effectively fr om the thiosulfate 
peak at 235 nm and the Tu concentrations quant ified. The results showed that there 
was no loss of Tu during the leaching, whic h is consistent with previous findings.

 The concentration profiles of polythionates are illustrated wi th two examples  in Figure 
48. As can be seen, the concentration s of polythionates increased with time 
approximately linearly in both the Tsc and NT A leaching systems. The concentrations 
of polythionates decreas ed in the order of S
4O62-, S3O62-, S5O62- and S 6O62-, while 
tetra- and tri-thionates m ade up about 80% of the total polythionates. Pentathionate 
was present at 1-5 mM but the amount of hexa thionate was usually insignificant. 
These results are generally consistent with previous observations. Because the 
leaching was conducted under  neutral or weakly acidic  conditions, polythionates 
could accumulate to quite high concentrati ons. For example, the concentrations of 
tetrathionate ranged from 4-48 mM dependi ng on the leaching conditions.  
  Table 19 presents values for losses of sulfur  from oxidation of thiosulfate and gains 
from total polythionates formation for all the l eaching tests. As can be seen, the sulfur 
balances are reasonable considering the associated errors involved.   Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology

95 6.2.6 Chemical Stability of Tsc 
It was noted in the previous section that the solutions containing Tsc darkened during 
leaching under some conditions, particularl y with high Tsc concentration (15 and 20 
mM) and high TS concentration (0.3 M). To investigate this further, a series of solutions with varied component concentra tions and pH were prepared and observed 
for 6 days to examine the stability of Tsc un der the test condition s (all at the ambient 
temperature). The compositions and pH of the solutions are listed in Table 21.

*pH was found to slowly drift in the given range. 
 
Figure 49 shows the changes in the a ppearance of the solutions during the 
experiment. The initial appearances are simila r to the solutions containing thiourea. 
At pH 6.5 the solution showed a yellow co lour (Nos. 1, 3 and 5-7) which turned 
orange at pH>7 (No. 2). The deeper colour  of No. 4 is due to a higher iron 
concentration. With thiourea, the pH normally increases slowly to a bove 7 if the initial 
pH is 6.5. This is because of the slow ox idation of TS by FeEDTA which is then 
regenerated by dissolved oxygen releasing hydr oxide. If the initial pH is above 7 the 
increase in pH is much less significant and reaches the same limit. This is also the 
case for the lower concentration of Tsc (1 0 mM), as shown in the final picture and 
Table 21. The pH increased from 6.5 to above 7 in Nos. 1 and 7, with the colour 
changing to light or deeper orange depending on the iron leve l. On the other hand, 
the pH of No. 2 only slight ly increased from the initial value of 7.5. With the Tsc 
concentration increased to 20 mM (Nos. 3- 6), however, apparent darkening of the 
solutions was observed and a ring of stain formed on the bottle n ear the top of each 
solution. Corresponding to this change, the so lutions remained at low pH and caused 
unstable pH readings. An exception was No . 4 whose initial pH was 7.5. It appears 
that Tsc is less stable with the higher  concentration and at the lower pH.

Supporting evidence was obtained from t he HPLC analysis and the results are 
presented in Figure 50. It can be seen fr om Figure 50a that, at pH 6.5, Tsc 
decomposed relatively slowly at the init ial concentration of 10 mM but obviously 
faster at 20 mM. The decomposition, ho wever, was independent of thiosulfate 
concentration in the range of 0.1-0.3 M. Figure 50b shows the decomposition of Tsc 
at different initial concentrations and diffe rent pH. With 10 mM Tsc, the loss of Tsc 
was not much different because the decompos ition was slow. With 20 mM Tsc, on 
the other hand, the de composition was significantly slow er at pH 7.5 than 6.5. These 
results are consistent with t he leaching tests, where the solutions were stable for the 
period of leaching with 10 mM Tsc while the solutions wi th higher Tsc concentrations 
were darkened. The chemical reactions associ ated with the loss of Tsc are yet to be 
elucidated. 
 Figure 50 also shows that the concentra tions of thiosulfate and FeEDTA changed 
little, ignoring the errors occurred in some cases.  In summary, Tsc is generally less stabl e than thiourea. The TS-Tsc-FeEDTA 
solutions are similar to those containing thiourea at low Tsc c oncentration. At high 
concentration, Tsc decomposes  at noticeable rates, particularly at lower pH. The 
decomposition seems to be independent of t he concentrations of TS and FeEDTA.

6.2.7 Effect of Tsc on Gold Oxidation 
Linear sweep voltammetry was performed on a ro tating gold disc electrode in various 
solutions to investigate the effect of Tsc on the oxidation of gold. The 
voltammograms so obtained ar e presented in Figure 51. In the absence of Tsc, the 
oxidation of gold in 0.1 M thiosulfate soluti on was hindered as indicated in Curve 1 by 
the low oxidation current starting at about  0.2 V. In the presence of 10 mM Tsc 
(Curve 3), the oxidation curr ent in the same potential r egion increased dramatically 
as a result of the catalysis of Tsc. This confirms the re sult reported previously and 
the effect is similar to that of thiourea.  Curve 2 is a voltamm ogram obtained from a 
solution containing 20 mM Tsc and 0.2 M K 2SO 4 (as supporting electrolyte). No 
oxidation current was recor ded until about 0.4 V, where T sc itself started to be 
oxidised to dithiosemicarbazide. This sugg ests that the increased current was not 
due to the oxidation of Tsc but, indeed, was due to catalyti c oxidation of gold. With 
increased Tsc concentration (20 mM), howeve r, no further increase in the oxidation 
current was observed. The result is in contrast  to the effect of thiourea and is not fully 06121824

6.2.8 Oxidant Stability 
In previous studies significant losses of t he FeEDTA oxidant, up to two thirds in some 
cases, have been observed.  However, the analysis of  the iron suffered from 
problems of precipitation in the samples du ring storage, often for more than a week. 
Therefore, the results were often inconsis tent and unreliable. An  improved procedure 
was employed, in which the samples were  treated with additional EDTA immediately 
after collection so that the iron was st abilised. It was confirmed that no iron 
precipitate was formed during the storage and that the treat ment did not affect the 
analysis of gold. This treatment method was applied to samples collected during 
Tests A-H and the iron concent ration results so obtained ar e presented in Figure 52.

As shown, there were only minor losses of th e oxidant in all the le aching tests except 
for Tests A and B. In thes e tests, the iron concentra tion dropped substantially 
immediately after the start of  leaching and then slowly reco vered to the original level 
at the end of the test. In Te st B, the large increase was partly due to addition of an 
extra 3 mM FeEDTA. This behaviour is not r eadily explained, but it may be related to 
the poor leaching results obtai ned for these two tests. 
 
6.3 Conclusions 
Electrochemical and dissoluti on studies showed that thio semicarbazide was similar 
to thiourea in promoting gold oxidatio n in the thiosulfate leaching system at a 
concentration of 10 mM. However, increasing the Tsc concentration to 20 mM showed no further benefits, which is different from thiourea. 
 
The stability of Tsc was found to dec rease with increasing concentration and 
decreasing pH. With a concentration of 10 mM, Tsc was reasonably stable at pH 6.5 
but decomposed noticeably at 20 mM. The dec omposition was much less significant 
at pH 7.5. The chemical reactions for t he decomposition have no t been identified. In 
general Tsc is less stable than thiourea.  
Among the few oxidants investigated, t he Fe-NTA complexes seemed to have the 
most potential. Though the electrochemical behaviours (reversibility and redox Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
100 potentials) of these complexes were not as  promising as FeEDTA, comparable gold 
dissolution rates could be achieved. The best performance in terms of gold 
dissolution was obtained with a Fe/NTA ratio of  about 1:2. With a ratio of 1:3 the rate 
decreased due to over-stabilisation of the ferri c ion. With the 1:1 ratio, on the other 
hand, the rate was faster but the stability of the ox idant may become an issue. 
 
Preliminary leaching tests using Ore Sa mple D with the TS-Tsc-FeEDTA system 
showed similar characteristics to those of the Tu-FeEDTA system with >90% gold 
recoveries being possible under optimum conditions. These included Tsc being 
catalytic for gold oxidation, leaching rate decreasing at pH>7, and thiosulfate 
oxidation catalysed by sulfide minerals. T he losses of thiosulfate were comparable to 
the TS-Tu-FeEDTA system and are fully  accountable by the formation of 
polythionates, with tetrathionat e and trithionate being the ma in products. The addition 
of phosphate effectively reduc ed thiosulfate consumption.  The FeEDTA oxidant was 
found to be stable during leachi ng and only a minor loss was observed. Compared to 
the thiourea system, the Tsc system show s a greater degree of uncertainty, 
presumably due to the decompos ition of Tsc. Further im provements in leaching 
performance and reproducibility rely on  a better understanding of the leaching 
system, particularly the chemistry of Tsc. 
 
The leaching of gold in t he NTA system under the conditi ons tested was generally 
less effective than the Tsc system. However,  the gold recoveries of up to 75% are 
reasonably good, considering the lack of kno wledge of this new s ystem. The leaching 
performance was found to depend on the Fe:NTA ratio and pH. The best results 
were obtained with a ratio of 1: 2, where the complex Fe(NTA) 2 was expected to be 
the predominant oxidant.  
7. FUTURE WORK 
It is recommended that future work should include the following aspects: 
 
• Investigation of possibl e ways of depressing the catalytic effect of sulfide 
minerals and carbonaceous materials. This is not only to reduce thiosulfate 
consumption, but also to increase t he efficiency of gold recovery by ion 
exchange. In addition, a high level of polythionates ma y have a negative effect 
on the gold leaching; 
 
• Studies on the treatment of polythionates, including removal of these species and 
possible recycle of thiosulfate, pr ior to the ion exchange step; 
 
• Other possible options of gold re covery, such as precipitation; 
 Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
101 • Further development of the thiosulfat e-Tsc system, using FeEDTA or other 
possible oxidants. This would include studi es on the chemistry of Tsc to obtain 
further knowledge of this chemical, as well as more systematic leaching tests 
with different ore types. A review of the toxicology of Tsc should also be 
undertaken; 
 
• The application of thiosulfate leaching systems for gravity concentrates, where 
fast dissolution kinetics are required to leach course gold. This would involve testing of both the “classic” coppe r-ammonia and “enhanced” FeEDTA systems. 
A laboratory assessment of gold recovery options following in tensive thiosulfate 
leaching would also be undertaken, includ ing direct electrowinning, cementation 
and sulfide prec ipitation.

cyanide chemistry in their circuit is the main deliverable for t he Sustainable Cyanide 
Management module. The Total Cyanide Balance (TCB) model is a relatively simple web based empirical simulator for predictin g the deportment of all input cyanide on a 
gold circuit lease. The model has been de signed both as a metallurgical and an 
environmental compliance tool.  Results from the TCB model are produced as either Static/”Snaps hot” data, in which 
the concentration of cyanide in its variou s forms for each part of the circuit are 
presented, or as Dynamic/”Flow ” data, in which the flow of cyanide around the circuit 
is calculated for each portion of the circ uit. Estimates of HCN emissions from the 
circuit and tailings impoundments are also made in the Dynamic mode. 
 To assist with model development, f our cyanide speciation surveys have been 
conducted at selected sites and involved the collection and subsequent analysis of 
samples from the leach/adsorption circuit as  well as from the associated tailings 
storage facility and cyanidation water circuit. A review of each of these surveys is 
included in this report. These reviews al so include some analysis  of the performance 
of the model in modelling aspects  of each of these circuits.  
 
An additional activity in this module was the completion of a major literature review of 
technology options for the destruction of cyanide from waste streams. This was 
prompted by the increased requi rement to destroy the cyani de content of gold milling 
effluents as a result of more stringent r egulatory controls on the discharge of cyanide 
waste streams and implementation of the ICMI Cyanide Code. Technologies 
available for cyanide destruction include a num ber of chemical processes as well as 
biological oxidation and ot her less well-known techni ques, anodic oxidation and 
photolytic (UV) cyanide destruction. Many of these processes are well established 
and recent developments have focussed on the combination of two or more such 
technologies to increase efficiency of the destruction process. The major methods 
covered in the review are the SO
2/Air (INCO) process, the hydrogen peroxide 
process, the use of Caro’s Acid, the CyPlus CombinOx process, the alkaline 
chlorination process, the use of chlorine di oxide, ozonation, bi ological destruction 
and electrolytic destruction.  All of the available cyanide destructi on methods have distinct advantages and 
disadvantages and these must be consider ed when selecting a detoxification process 
for a particular application. Traditionally, natural degradation in tailings storage 
facilities has been the favoured cyanide treat ment method used at Australian gold 
operations, however, alternative detoxification strategies wi ll require to be considered 
in the light of legislat ive and regulatory changes.  Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
 1041. INTRODUCTION 
The primary focus of the Su stainable Cyanide Management  module was to develop 
an on-line model to describe the deportment and rate of flux of cyanide within a 
mining lease. Initial developm ent of the Parker Centre Total Cyanide Balance (TCB) 
Model involved using site survey data co llected previously. Subsequently, four 
surveys of cyanidation circuits and TSF facili ties were undertaken at selected sites to 
facilitate data gathering to support the dev elopment and validation of the TCB model.  
 An additional activity in this module was the completion of a major literature review of 
technology options for the destruction of cyanide from waste streams. Among the 
outcomes from this model would be im proved knowledge and u nderstanding of the 
fate of cyanide used in the leaching oper ations and thus greater confidence with 
reporting obligations.   
2. THE TOTAL CYANIDE BALANCE MODEL 
The Total Cyanide Balance model matches the total quantity of cyanide inputs to a 
gold circuit (typically as sodium cyanide to one or more leach tanks and to an elution 
pre-treat make up tank) with cyanide outputs fr om the circuit (in the form of various 
decomposition products). Cyanide may be  converted to various decomposition 
products well before ultimate loss from the circuit since many decomposition 
products (eg thiocyanate, ir on cyanides and ammonia) c an recirculate in various 
solution streams. The location and form of  ultimate cyanide loss includes hydrogen 
cyanide (HCN) volatilised from leach tan ks, tailings dam and cyanide water ponds, 
ammonia produced as a cyanide oxidation product in electrowinning cells, and 
insoluble metal cyanides and thiocyanates prec ipitated in consolidat ed residue in the 
tailings storage facility. The TCB model as sumes no cyanide loss from tailings dams 
via solution seepage, al though it is recognis ed that this does occur in most instances 
(the percentage loss being highly variable).   
2.1 General Structure of the Model 
The Total Cyanide Balance model is a re latively simple web based empirical 
simulator for predicting the deportment of all input cyanide on a gold circuit lease. 
The model has been designed both as a metallurgical and an environmental 
compliance tool. By providing greater understanding of the sources of cyanide 
conversion and loss, the model should faci litate cost reduction strategies to be 
implemented. By defining cyanide loss rates,  it allows more accurate statutory 
submissions such as National Pollutant Inventory (NPI) estimates of cyanide 
emission to air, land and water.   Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
 105The TCB model is password acce ssible. It is designed to take information on circuit 
layout and cyanide chemistry, provided by the user, and output a summary of the 
cyanide chemistry and flows through the circui t from leach feed to tailings disposal. 
The user is required to input essential in formation on the circuit design e.g. number 
and size of tanks, size of thickeners etc,  and information on the cyanide chemistry in 
key parts of the circuit. The model can accommodate varying levels of cyanide data, 
either comprehensive and detailed information for all parts of the circuit, or less 
complete information. Although the amount of  cyanide data requir ed by the model is 
flexible, certain key data are requi red before the model can be used. 
 Where the cyanide data is incomplete, the m odel is able to provide estimates for the 
missing data, using algorithms derived fr om a comprehensive database of site 
surveys undertaken over the last 10 years.  Results from the TCB model  are produced in 2 forms: 
 
• Static/”Snapshot” Option. In this opt ion the concentration of cyanide in its 
various forms for each part of t he circuit are presented, both as 
concentration of the various cyanide sp ecies, and as the total mass of “CN 
equivalents” (in kilograms) contained in each portion of the circuit.  
 
• Dynamic/”Flow” Option. In this option th e flow of cyanide around the circuit is 
calculated as “kilograms of CN equivalent/hour” for each portion of the 
circuit. Estimates of HCN emissions  from the circuit and tailings 
impoundments are also made in this mode. 
 Input data and results can be saved in an XML file on the user’s hard drive for future 
reference.  
2.2 Static Model Option 
The computational basis of th e static model component is essentially a series of 
empirical formulae that have been derived from detailed trend analysis of plant 
cyanide speciation data from sponsors’ gold mi ne sites. Critical input data for this 
component includes cyanide species and key bas e metal analyses in at least the first 
and final leach stages. These data are necessary  as it is not possible to predict the 
rate and quantity of formation of the various cyanide decomposition products, 
cyanate, thiocyanate and the stable metal cy anide complexes of copper, iron, zinc 
and nickel due to highly site specific dyna mics. Cyanide reactions are a function of 
ore mineralogy, water quality, cyanide conc entration and use of other reagents such 
as lead nitrate and litharge among other fa ctors. Assumptions made in the static 
model component include:   Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
 1061. Gold and silver cyanide complexes are negligible relative to total cyanide 
content. 
 
2. All solution copper is present as Cu(CN) 32- (3 moles of CN per mole of 
copper). 
 
3. All solution iron is present as Fe(CN) 64-/3- (6 moles of CN per mole of iron). 
 
4. All solution nickel is present as Ni(CN) 42- (4 moles of CN per mole of nickel). 
 
5. All solution zinc is present as Zn(CN) 42- (4 moles of CN per mole of zinc). 
 
6. Cyanide associated with ot her metals such as cobalt is negligible with 
respect to total cyanide. 
 
7. Neither thiocyanate (SCN) nor cyanate (C NO) is included as part of the Total 
Cyanide measurement. They are effectively “sinks” for cyanide (i.e. cyanide by-products), and under normal conditions the CN fraction of these two molecules is not easily returned to the environment. Ther efore, they are 
treated as separate species of interest. 
 
Calculations involve application of empiri cal formulae (in some cases relatively 
complex) to each cyanide species reported in  first and final leach stages to predict 
quantities in the intermedi ate stages and then calcul ation of CN equivalent 
concentrations and percentages of each specie s for presentation in the form of pie 
charts. The model applies check calculati ons on input data to ensure that free 
cyanide plus cyanide comple xes of copper, nickel and zinc approximately match 
weak acid dissociable (WAD) cyanide le vel and that WAD cya nide plus iron 
complexed cyanide approximat ely equal total cyanide. Th e user is alerted to 
significant discrepancies in the data that w ould require rechecking before sensible 
deportment calculations can be carried out.  
2.3 Cyanide Data Input Options 
Operations collect cyanide data from thei r circuit in a numbe r of forms. Typical 
examples include:  
 Measurement of titratable cyanide (r eported as mg/L NaCN) at site, and 
determination of the metal concentrations in solutions (reported as mg/L of the 
metal).  
 
 Measurement of Free Cyanide (FCN), Weak  Acid Dissociable Cyanide (WADCN) 
and Total Cyanide (TCN) (all reported as mg/L CN).  
 Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology

  Determination of metals present as the cyanide species.  
 In addition, sites may (or may not) meas ure thiocyanate (SCN) and cyanate (CNO). 
 
2.3.1 Circuit Data Input Pages 
 
The first input page is the “Circuit Data – Configuration” page, where information on 
the general structure of the circuit is supp lied (Figure 1). This information is then 
used by the model to determine what othe r input pages (and their layout) will be 
required.

The next series of pages is used to acquire  data on the various unit processes for the 
particular circuit. Figure 2 is an example of su ch pages, in this case for the leach and 
adsorption circuit.  Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology

 Drop-down boxes enable the user to defi ne the ore type and t he leach feed stream 
type. The four options for ore type are: allu vial/oxidised/free milling; reactive sulfide; 
unreactive sulfide; and high copper. The three options for leach feed type are: whole 
of ore; flotation concentr ate; and flotation tailing. 
 The circuit data pages for the tailings dam storage (Figure 3) and the process water 
storage are very simple, with only a minimu m of data being request ed at this point.

Figure 5 shows the input page for the leach/adsorption circuit. 
 Assays for the major cyanide species must be known for selected tanks in the leach/adsorption tank system. The data required has been colour coded into 3 
sections; Section A which is compulsory and Sections B and C, where either set of 
data is sufficient, although if both B and C data are available the model can provide 
more precise results. There is also an addi tional optional section, mainly related to 
minor metals, which may be rele vant for certain operations.

2.4 Output Pages 
At this point the user can choose to save  all the input data as an XML file (strongly 
recommended) or to return to any of the dat a input pages to alter input data (Figure 
7). When all data are believed to be sound, t he results calculation can be initiated. 
Results are presented in the form of tables  and graphs. The summary table provides 
a snapshot of cyanide deportment and can be expanded to provide more detailed 
information (expressed in terms of CN equiva lent) for the various cyanide containing 
solutions on the operation lease (provided a ll have been stipulated by the user). All 
forms of cyanide are accounted for, in cluding the degradation products thiocyanate 
and cyanate.            Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology

 114The thiocyanate and cyanate sp ecies are not represented within the pie chart, but 
are listed separately, reflec ting the fact they are not formally considered cyanide 
species.  
2.5 Dynamic Flow Option 
The overall structure/logic of the Dynamic op tion is illustrated in Figure 9. It combines 
the cyanide species concentration data from the Static option with  flow data provided 
by the user in the input pages. All cyanide  species are combined into one single 
cyanide flow value (CN kg/hr).  The model, in which cyanide flows (in kilograms of CN equivalents per  hour) are 
reported for all significant points of lo ss, incorporates a series of black box 
calculations focussing on the l each/adsorption tank system, the 
elution/electrowinning area,  the tailings storage facilit y and the cyanide containing 
water ponds nominated by the user. The ca lculation basis and assumptions made in 
estimating cyanide conversion or loss for each area are described briefly in the 
following sections.  
2.5.1 Leach/Adsorption Tank Cyanide Loss 
Volatilisation as HCN is t he only possible direct loss mechanism for cyanide from 
leach/adsorption tanks, although conver sion to thiocyanate, cyanate and metal 
cyanides can be significant, depending on or e type, and results in ultimate loss in 
consolidated residue. Mass balancing has  sometimes been used as a method for 
estimating HCN emission but such an approach relies on the significant assumptions 
that cyanide input can be measured accurately  for the residence time of the tank, that 
the tank operates under steady state conditi ons, and that all cyanide species present 
are measurable with high accuracy. The e rrors associated with this approach are 
large and the TCB model instead relies up on the knowledge that HCN gas evolution 
is proportional to the concent ration of HCN in solution (Henry’s Law). The level of 
HCN
(aq) in tank slurry is a function of free  cyanide concentration in solution, pH, 
salinity, temperature, c ontainment geometry and agitation rate. The calculation 
incorporates all of these fa ctors including an oxygen stri pping factor to allow for 
sparging of air or oxygen to the tank. This calculation was first incorporated into the 
Parker Centre Tank HCN Emission Model and typically indicates that no more than 
1-2% of tank input cyanide is lost from  the tank system as gaseous HCN. The model 
was validated by previous site  work at Paddington Gold Mi ne and is believed to be 
one of the most accurate co mponents of the TCB model.

 1165.2.2 Tailings Storage Area Cyanide Loss 
Tailings storage is the area from which the greatest propor tion of cyanide is lost and 
also the most difficult area in which to  accurately determine cyanide fate. The 
complexity of cyanide behaviour  in tailings storage facilities has been the subject of 
much research and previous modelling but TCB model development draws heavily 
on the conclusions from previous research projects i.e. that only two pathways are 
significant for describing the fate of cyanide discharged in tailings slurry – 
volatilisation (the overwhelmingly predom inant mechanism of  cyanide loss from 
tailings impoundments) and precipitation and consolidation into essentially dry 
tailings solids as non toxic copper-iron cy anide compounds over a period of decades, 
assuming no loss from seepage. Various  researchers have estimated that 
volatilisation of HCN accounts for approx imately 90% of cyanide removed from 
tailings impoundment decant solution and confi dence in the conclusion is justified on 
several grounds. The TCB model reflects th is conclusion but ascribes HCN loss to 
two areas of the dam i.e.  the exposed beach area be tween spigot and decant pond 
and the decant pond itself. The proportion of loss in each area will depend on a semi-
quantitative comparison of  beach area to pond area. 
 The conclusion from work carried out previously that HCN volatilisation and hexacyanoferrate formation and ultimate precipitation are t he only other key 
pathways in the fate of cyanide in tai lings structures was accompanied by a 
significant downplaying of other possible reactions and processes often proposed by 
other researchers. The relative  ‘non-issues’ therefore not c onsidered at all in the TCB 
include:  
• In situ oxidation or hydrolysis of cyanide 
• Microbial consumption of cyanide 
• Reaction with reduced sulfur  species to form thiocyanate 
• Adsorption of cyanide species on to solids 
 Note that formation of thiocyanate can be significant in the leaching circuit and the 
TCB model accounts for such degradation prior to tailings facility discharge. 
 Whereas previous research at both the Park er Centre and by othe rs has specifically 
focussed on metal – cyanide equilibria relations and the routes to cyanide 
volatilisation from the dec ant pond, the TCB model takes a more  holistic approach 
(albeit qualitative and partl y semi-quantitative) to understanding overall cyanide 
behaviour in the TSF system. Detailed analyse s of factors influencing the rate of 
hydrogen cyanide volatilisation such as su rface area and depth of decant pond, pH, 
temperature, ionic strengt h, wind speed, degree of mixing in decant water body, 
turbulence on the water surface and so on hav e not been incorporated into the model 
although some of these may be consi dered in future refinements.  Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
 117 
The major assumptions made in deriving  flowrates of cyanide in the dynamic 
component of the TCB m odel are as follows: 
 1. Ninety per cent of “free”  cyanide in spigot discharge is volatilised as HCN on the 
tailings beach before reaching the dec ant pond. WAD cyani de, strong metal 
complexes and degradation products th iocyanate and cyanate are assumed to 
report to the decant pond in entirety. 
 2. A percentage of tailings water is trapped “instantaneously” in consolidated 
residue to a density of 75% solids. The proportion of the cyani de trapped in this 
manner is determined by the settling density. This cyanide is assumed to remain 
in the dam indefinitely. 
 3. The concentration of cy anide in pore water equals the concentration of cyanide 
in the decant water before re moval of pond volatilised HCN. 
 4. Any remaining cyanide is returned to the plant in the return water. 
 5. The model makes no allowances for the loss of cyanide by seepage. Seepage 
rates are highly variable and often poorly me asured or estimated. In addition, in 
most cases the amount of cyanide being carried away by water seepage is very 
small, as a percentage of the total cyanide entering the tailings disposal system. 
 It is recognised that some of these assu mptions require more validation work but 
given the holistic view noted above they are considered the best compromise to 
achieving a broad picture of cyanide fate  that will be commensurate with total 
cyanide input for any user site.  The tailings model is ill ustrated in Figure 10.

The Dynamic option calculates the following flow  data (highlighted in colour in Figure 9): 
 
• Flow rate of cyanide into the gr inding circuit from  return water 
 
• Cyanide flow rate into and from the CIL circuit, and between each tank 
 
• Loss of cyanide as HCN gas from each CIL tank 
 
• Flow rate of cyanide into the CI L circuit from the elution circuit 
 
• If a post leach thickener is installed: 
Flow rate of cyanide from the CIL circuit into the thickener 
Flow rate of cyanide in the th ickener overflow (to storage) 
Flow rate of cyanide in the thickener underflow  
Loss rate of cyanide as HCN gas  from thickener surface 
 
• If cyanide destruction/recovery is installed: 
  Flow rate of cyanide to storage from cyanide recovery, or   Loss rate of cyanide from cyanide destruction  
• Flow rate of cyanide to tailings dispos al from CIL circuit/post leach thickener 
 
• At the tailings impoundment: 
Rate of cyanide deposited into consolidated sediment Rate of cyanide evolved as HCN gas from beaches and decant pond Flow rate of cyanide in decant water 
 
• Loss rate of cyanide from process water tanks and dams as HCN gas 
 
The output pages for the Dynamic option follow a similar format to that of the Static 
option described in Section 2.4.  Figure 11 shows the summary page for the dy namic data, tabulating the solution and 
cyanide flow rates in to and out of each circuit component present. Solution flow rates 
are given in m

cyanide species have been combined into one overall total CN flow rate.

2.6 Conclusions 
The Parker Centre Total Cyanide Balance M odel is designed to profile the deportment 
of all input cyanide on a gold circuit lease and to  predict the form and ra te of loss of this 
reagent from various points in the usage cycle. The model co mbines the features of a 
number of simulators developed previously fo r predicting cyanide emission data as well 
as knowledge accumulated fr om that and other cyanide re search projects. The model 
incorporates both a Static opt ion, which provides a “snapshot ” of the concentration of 
cyanide in its various forms for each part of the circuit, and a Dynamic option, which 
allows users to estimate the cyanide fl ows around their circuit. The model should 
provide greater understanding of the sources of  cyanide loss from gold circuits and thus Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
  
 
122 facilitate cost reduction strategies to be implemented. It should also facilitate more 
accurate statutory submissions such as Nati onal Pollutant Inventor y (NPI) estimates of 
cyanide emission to air, land and water.   The model is available for pr oject Sponsors to use on-line.

3. SITE SURVEYS 
Four site surveys were under taken on the following dates: 
 
• Site A, August 22
nd and 23rd 2007 
• Site B, September 5th and 6th 2007 
• Site C, November 13th and14th, 2007 
• Site D, March 13th, 2008 
 
The scope of all visits included sampli ng of pulp from each st age of the CIP/CIL 
circuit, surface sampling of selected tail ings storage facility (TSF) streams and 
solution sampling of cyanide contai ning dams and ponds. No sampling was 
undertaken in elution or intensive cyan idation circuits as these had been 
characterised with some confi dence during previous projects. 
 Sampling procedures followed sim ilar lines at all sites. One litre pulp or liquor samples 
were collected in the field and pH  tested in the site laboratory  before pressure filtration 
to obtain 2 x 125 mL portions  of cyanide liquor. The sub-sa mples were either left 
unpreserved or were preserv ed by pH adjustment to >11 using caustic soda (NaOH) 
pellets, chilled and despatched to Murdoch Univ ersity where silver nitrate titration was 
performed (if titrateable cyanide level was likely to be sufficient to measure). The bulk of 
the chilled liquor was delivered to the WA Chemistry Centre for cyanide species and

123 4. LITERATURE REVIEW 
This review focussed on the increased require ment to destroy the cyanide content of 
gold milling effluents as a result of more st ringent regulatory contro ls on the discharge 
of cyanide waste streams and implementation of the ICMI  Cyanide Code. Processes 
available for cyanide destruction include a num ber of chemical pr ocesses as well as 
biological oxidation and ot her less well-known techni ques, anodic oxidation and 
photolytic (UV) cyanide destruction. A copy of the review is pr esented in Appendix 5.

 124APPENDIX 1 – REVIEW OF SITE  A CYANIDE SPECIATION SURVEY 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
A cyanide speciation survey of the Site A CIL/Adsorption circuit and associated 
tailings deposition and return water storage areas was conducted on August 22 and 23, 2007, pursuant to the objectives of  the Sustainable Cyanide Management 
module. The primary aim of this module is to provide sponsors with the knowledge 
and tools to ensure that t he total management of cyani de meets all recognized 
benchmarks of community acceptance. The si te survey permitted data gathering to 
facilitate further development and refinement  of the simulation mass balance model 
designed to predict behaviour of all cy anide species on a mining lease.  
  
2. CIRCUIT OVERVIEW 
 
The leach/adsorption circuit at  Site A comprises two CIL trains fed from a leach feed 
thickener and discharging via individual ca rbon safety screens to a CIL tailings 
thickener. Underflow from t he leach feed thickener is split in a feed hopper and 
distributed to Leach Tanks LT1 and LT1-01 in Trains 1 and 1-0 (aka Train 2), 
respectively. Six adsorption stages fo llow the single leach stage and thickened 
tailings pulp at 60% solids is pumped to a central thickened discharge (CTD) tailings 
storage facility (TSF) located approximately 3 km from the processing plant. The Site 
A TSF has an area of 320 hectares and is one of  a very small number in Australia of 
the CTD design type. Decant water accumulates in one significant pond area and several minor peripheral pools and flows through a drainage in take port to an 
adjacent stormwater impoundm ent pond. Figure 1 shows an  aerial view of the 
processing plant and Figure 2, a schem atic of the cyanidation circuit.

3. SURVEY PROCEDURE 
 
One litre pulp samples were collected at each sampling point in wide neck screw top 
plastic bottles and delivered to the laborat ory for density and pH checking followed by 
pressure filtration to obtain two, 125 mL por tions of cyanide liquor. One bottle was pH 
adjusted to >11 (preserved) using caustic soda (NaOH) pellets and the other was left 
Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
 128at unadjusted/natural pH ( unpreserved). The liquor samples were chilled for CN- 
preservation in transit to Mur doch where silver nitrate titr ation was carried out on both 
preserved and unpreserved samples (if titr ateable cyanide level was likely to be 
sufficient to measure). Remaining chille d liquor was delivered to the Chemistry 
Centre (WA) for cyanide species and metals analysis.  For water pond samples (TSF supernatant pools, decant pond, stormwater dam 
pools), a 1 litre jar was filled carefully in th e field so as to minimise disturbance of 
shoreline sediments and 2 x 125 mL sub-samples de canted from the bottle in the 
laboratory.  Streams sampled were as follows:  Day 1, (22
nd August 2007) 
• Leach Circuit Feed (Leach Feed Thickener Underflow) 
• Train 1 Tank LT1 and Tank T6 (Tank 7 offline)    (2) 
• Train 1-0 Tank LT1-01 and Tank 1-07  (2) 
• Tails Thickener Feed 
• Tails Thickener Overflow 
• Tails Thickener Underflow 
 Day 2 (23
rd August 2007) 
• Leach Circuit Feed 
• Leach Feed Thickener Overflow 
• Train 1 Tank 6 
• Train 1-0 Tank LT1-01 and Tanks T1-02 through T1-07  (7) 
• Tails Thickener Feed 
• Tails Thickener Overflow 
• Tails Thickener Underflow 
• Stormwater Dam Point 1 (S W1), near decant intake 
• Stormwater Dam Point 2 (SW2), opposite intake 
• CTD Pool Area 1 (estimated 700 m2, inactive) 
• CTD Pool Area 2 (estimated 400 m2, recently active) 
• CTD Pool Area 3 (active)

time and sampling equipment permitted. Figure 6 shows approximate sample point 
locations in the tailings area.

 Pulp Density measurements were obtained only for Leach Feed Thickener Underflow 
& Tails Thickener Underflow streams, although 1 litre pulp masses were measured in 
the laboratory for LT1, T6, LT1-01, T1-07,  Tails Thickener Feed and Tails Thickener 
O/F. Measured leach feed thickener underfl ow densities were 59% and 58% on the 
two survey days and the corresponding taili ngs thickener underflow densities were 
64% and 67% solids.   
4. RESULTS 
 
4.1 Speciation Assays 
 
Full cyanide and metal species assay results for all streams sampled at Site A on 
Day 2 (August 23) are provided in Tables 2 and 3.  The following general comments apply to the tabulated results: 
 1. pH in the Site A leach/adsorption ci rcuit peaks at only 8.6 due to the buffering 
effect of the hypersaline process water av ailable on site. It drops to 7.5 - 8.0 in

 130the TSF facility, thus incr easing the probability of HCN lo ss by volatilisation in 
this area. 
 2. Titrateable cyanide level was determined after adjusting pH  to ~12 by addition of 
sodium hydroxide. Some determinations were also done directly at sample pH 
and these results were generally between 25 and 35% lower than the high pH 
determinations. A plant log sheet for 24
th August indicates a Tk 1 CN reading of 
226.4 ppm so presumably the plant operator titration pr ocedure does not involve 
initial pH adjustment. Some free cyanide present as HCN (aq) will not be 
determined in this case.  
 3. Titrateable cyanide declines rapidly in  this CIP circuit in conjunction with a 
decline in Total cyanide and a rise in the level of the degr adation products 
thiocyanate and cyanate. The levels of base me tals in solution remain relatively 
constant. 
 4. WAD cyanide level in tailings thickener U/F and TSF discharge (90 ppm) 
exceeds the limit recommended for avia n wildlife exposure  (50 ppm) but the 
WAD level in all exposed TSF water bodies was at or below th is level. The lack 
of exposed cyanide solution pond area in the CTD type TSF design is advantageous with respect to level of wildlife exposure hazard.  
 5. There is a background leve l of thiocyanate present in  process water of around 
70 ppm and significant conversion of cyanide  to this species occurs in the first 
leach stage with a slower rise in SCN level in subsequent tanks. Whilst around 
40-50% of this species in the tanks is present as a recirc ulating load, losses 
occur via degradation and/or pr ecipitation into consolidated tailings (copper(I) 
thiocyanate is practically insoluble in water).  
 6. Significant levels of  cyanate (80-90 ppm) are also  formed in the CIP system 
before attenuation by some 50% in the TSF system. 
 7. There is significant variability in cyani de levels in the po ol areas around the TSF 
with the southern ponds with higher cyanide apparent ly accumulating in a 
shorter time period than the low cyani de ponds on the northern side. There 
would likely be an element of randomnes s about the way ponds form at the 
perimeter of the CT D system. The stormwater sample s collected at the western 
pond area contain cyanide leve ls typical of standard TSF return water (~20 ppm 
Total CN).

 1338. Copper is the most significant base me tal present at levels  of 60-90 ppm in 
leach solutions, although ir on at 40-50 ppm coul d potentially complex 
significantly more cyanide than copper. T he fact that assayed levels of Total 
cyanide (which includes CN complexed with iron) are practically equal to 
assayed WAD CN levels (which excl udes iron cyanide complexes) would 
appear to contradict this. T here are 3 possible explanat ions for the discrepancy 
between assayed WAD cyanide and calculated iron cyanide equivalent: 
 
a. Analytical error in Total cyanide determination. 
 
b. Solution iron that has been determi ned displays unusual chemistry and is 
not present in the form of cyanide co mplexes but rather other forms. 
 
c. Despite the best efforts to  filter the samples some iron is present as finely 
suspended solid or colloid which has appeared in the solution iron assay. 
Although the third of these explanations is more likely,  the percentage of cyanide 
present as different species in the fi rst leach and final adsorption stage has been 
calculated assuming all the assayed iron is present as cyanide complexes. The data 
are displayed as Figures 7 and 8.

 Titrateable (predominantly “free”) cyanide ac counts for less than half the total cyanide 
in the first stage and less than a quarter in t he final adsorption stage due to the rise in 
relative proportion of copper cyanide species in particular. Note that thiocyanate and 
cyanate are not generally rega rded as cyanide species but rather as degradation 
products and are thus not included in these graphs.  
4.2 WAD Cyanide Calculation Check 
 
An analysis was conducted on the cyanide speciation assays to compare WAD 
cyanide level as determined by assay with a value calculated from titrateable cyanide 
plus the principal WAD cyanide metal spec ies copper and nickel. Data from this 
analysis are shown in Table 4.  The figures show that the calculated WAD CN, derived from titrateable and metal 
assays, generally provides a very good estima te of WAD, usually within error of the 
analysis. If anything, the WAD cyanide  level would appear to be slightly 
overestimated by the calcul ation method using solution metal assays. This suggests 
that for routine monitoring of WAD pursuan t to Cyanide Code compliance monitoring, 
simple onsite measurements of ti trateable cyanide and copper (and Ni) 
concentrations can provide a good estimate  of WAD, without the need for full WAD 
assays.

5. SIMULATION 
 
The principal purpose of the Si te A survey was to gather data to facilitate testing and 
refinement of the Parker Centre TCB model. Some specific aspects of the model that 
required to be tested using the site dat a are covered in following sections.  
 
5.1 Data Interpolation 
 
The input data requirements for the TCB m odel vary significantly depending upon the 
complexity of the circuit and the availability of data. In the tank system the minimum 
data requirement is to have cyanide spec ies and some metal assays for the first 
leach stage and the final adsorption stage. If no more tank assay data than this are 
available, the model is r equired to interpolate the cyanide deportment in the 
intermediate stages and an al gorithm was developed for this purpose based on data 
collected in previous projects. Site A data have been used to  validate the tank 
interpolation calculation with actual WAD cyanide assays shown alongside the WAD 
CN assays predicted by the model in Table 5.       Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology

For Site A, the model inter polation is found to be excell ent for all bar 2 tanks and the 
site data do not indicate a need for alterati on of the tank cyanide interpolation basis. 
 
5.2 Dynamic Cyanide Flow Prediction 
 
The Parker Centre TCB model has a dynamic  cyanide flow calculation component for 
predicting the areas of cyanide loss as desc ribed in previous reports. The areas of 
cyanide loss as defined in the model are:  
• As gaseous HCN volatilis ed from the leach/ads orption tank system 
 
• As gaseous HCN volatilised from t he residue storage beach area between the 
discharge spigot and the central decant solution pond 
 
• As gaseous HCN volatilised from the open ponded water bodies including 
residue decant pond and process water dams 
 
• As ammonia generated electrolytically at the electrowinning cell cathodes 
 
In addition to these areas of “loss” from the site  containment system, cyanide 
degrades and is lost for the purposes of effective use as a bona fide gold leaching 
reagent in the following areas:  
• Conversion to cyanate and thiocyanate in  the leach tanks and hydrolysis and 
precipitation of these com pounds in the residue storage area 
 
• Complexation (both reversible and irreve rsible) with other metal species in 
solution (eg copper, nickel,  iron and zinc) and precipit ation as insoluble and 
environmentally inactive specie s in consolidated residue  Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
 137 
These forms of cyanide “loss” are track ed in the TCB model and  a proportion of new 
cyanide introduced to the circuit can remain in solution as a circulating load. Data 
from Site A have been tested in the prototype version of the TCB and outputs with 
respect to the fate of cyanide in the TSF system are summarized in Figure 9.  
  
 
 
Figure 9.  Modelling of Site  A Tailings Cyanide Flows  
 
 Although the TCB m odel is based upon conventional  paddock or cross valley 
impoundment style dams which would produce significantly larger supernatant 
solution areas than the CTD style dam, the broad cyanide loss predictions for Site A 
appear reasonable. 18% of the total CN present  in TSF discharge pulp is predicted to 
volatilise from the dam surface as HCN and a high 78.5% is predicted to become 
trapped in long term storage as various insoluble metal cyanide forms. The 
percentage lost as HCN is much higher at other sites which do not have tailings 
thickeners (which serve to re tain a much higher proportion of reagent in the treatment 
plant system) and which also have more  supernatant pond surface area. The 
prediction for low cyanide loss on the “beach” (1.3%) could be subject to high error 
for a CTD in this empirical model and the pr edicted concentration of  cyanide in water 
recovered from the TSF would also appear to be erroneously low.     t/h solids 450

 1385.3 Further Data Analysis and Model Testing 
 
Further analysis of the Site A data is pl anned as the model is refined outside of the 
MERIWA M384 project period and some follow up contact with site personnel is 
expected pursuant to these activities. The primary purpose for which the survey work was undertaken (data gathering to aid model  development) is considered to have 
been fully satisfied.    
6. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
A basic cyanide speciation survey was carried out at Site A to aid the development 
and testing of the Parker Centre Total Cyanide Balance Model. The data indicated 
that there is significant cyanide metal s peciation and degradatio n in the CIL tanks 
with copper and possibly iron complexing over  half the total cyanide present in CIL 
tailings. Much of the cyanide discharging in to the CTD TSF area would appear to 
consolidate into long term storage with less than 20% volatili sing from the dam 
surface as HCN. There is a significant le vel of the degradation products thiocyanate 
and cyanate recirculating in the plant soluti on. Site A data will be used for further 
testing and validation of the Parker Centre TCB model as  the program operation is 
refined.

 139APPENDIX 2 – REVIEW OF SITE  B CYANIDE SPECIATION SURVEY 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
A cyanide speciation survey of Site B Lea ch/CIP Adsorption circuit and associated 
tailings deposition and return water st orage areas was conducted on September 5th 
and 6th 2007, in accordance with the objec tives of the Sust ainable Cyanide 
Management module. The primary aim of this  module is to provide sponsors with the 
knowledge and tools to ensur e that the total managem ent of cyanide meets all 
recognised benchmarks of community acceptance. The site survey permitted data gathering to facilitate further developmen t and refinement of the Parker Centre 
simulation model designed to pr edict behaviour of cyanide species on a mining lease.  
  
2. CIRCUIT OVERVIEW 
 
The cyanidation leach circuit at Site B has a nominal capacity of 7 Mtpa (550 tph) and 
consists of 5 leach only stages and a car ousel CIP adsorption circuit with 6 tanks and 
pump cells to facilitate slurry transfer. Ca rbon is held in each stage and the point of 
slurry ingress progressively alter ed after loaded carbon (having received 
progressively higher grade slurry feed) is withdrawn for elution. At the time of the 
survey, PC 6 was the feed tank and the sl urry then flowed through PCs 1 to 5 with 
tailings leaving PC 5.  This type of circuit is unusual in Australia  and offered the opportunity to examine the 
impacts of this circuit design (if any) on cyanide chemistry. General views of the 
cyanidation leach and carousel CIP plant  are shown as Figures 1 and 2.

3. SURVEY PROCEDURE 
 
One litre pulp samples were collected at each sampling point in wide neck screw top 
plastic bottles and pressure filtered at t he laboratory after pH measurement of the 
pulp. Two x 125 mL portions of cyanide liquor were obtai ned during filtra tion with one 
bottle being pH adjusted to >11 (preserved)  using caustic soda (NaOH) pellets and 
the other left at unadjusted/nat ural pH (unpreserved). The liquor samples were chilled 
for CN- preservation in transit to Murdoch where silver nitrate titration was carried out 
on both preserved and unpreserved samples (i f titrateable cyanide level was likely to 
be sufficient to measure). Remaining ch illed liquor was delivered to the WA 
Chemistry Centre for cyanide species and metals analysis. 
 Streams sampled on 5
th September 2007 were as follows:

• TSF 3 RW Pond 
• Tails Water Return Dam (TSF 2) 
• TSF 2 Decant Pond

In addition to these, 5 samples were colle cted at the Heap Leach recovery plant as 
follows:  
• Column Feed  
• Column Tail 
• ILS Tank 
• PLS Tank 
• BLS Tank 
 
At the time of the Site B survey, the aut omatic cyanide analyser (TAC) in the first 
leach tank was reading 254 ppm NaCN a nd the titrateable cyanide set point was 
advised to be 280 ppm.  
  
4. RESULTS 
 
4.1 Speciation Assays 
 
Full cyanide and metal specie s assay results for all str eams sampled at Site B are 
provided in Tables 1 and 2.  The following general comments apply to the tabulated results: 
 1. pH in the Site B CIP circuit peaks at 9.1 due to the buffering effect of the saline 
process water available on site. It drops to less than 7 in the process water system. 
 2. Titrateable cyanide level in the fi rst leach stage was measured as 215 ppm 
NaCN at the sampled pH, and 302 ppm NaCN at high pH compared to the 
TAC measurement of 254 ppm NaCN. 
 3. Titrateable cyanide results in pH adj usted solutions were approximately 70% 
higher than the unadjusted solution result s due to the relative ly low operating 
pH in this circuit. 
 Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
 1444. WAD cyanide level in tailings dischar ging into the TSF (88 ppm) exceeded the 
limit recommended for avian wildlife expos ure (50 ppm) but had attenuated to 
less than 40 ppm in the decant ponds and return water dam.  
 5. There is a background leve l of thiocyanate present in  process water of around 
70 - 90 ppm and significant conversion of cyanide to this species occurs in the first leach stage with a minimal rise in SCN level in subsequent tanks. Whilst around 70% of this species in the tanks is present as a recirculating load, 
losses occur via degradation and/or prec ipitation into consolidated tailings 
(e.g. as precipitated copper(I) thiocyanate). 
 6. Moderate levels of cyanate (30 ppm) are present in the tailings system but this 
species is effectively completely dissipated in the TSF. 
 7. Copper and iron are the main base metals  present in the leach circuit from a 
cyanide perspective and they account fo r more than half of the complexed 
cyanide. Figures 5 and 6 show the perc entage of cyanide present as different 
species in the first leach and final adsor ption stage. Note t hat thiocyanate and 
cyanate are not generally regarded as cyanide species but rather as 
degradation products and ar e thus not included in these graphs.

 Titrateable (predominantly “free”) cyanide a ccounts for slightly more than half the 
total cyanide in the first stage and less than half in all leach and adsorption stages 
thereafter, with copper and iron cyanide  complexes predominant. The speciation 
through the circuit is remarkably consistent  relative to other cyanidation circuits 
studied. As noted previously , thiocyanate and cyanate are not generally regarded as 
cyanide species but rather as degradatio n products and are thus not included in 
these graphs.

 1495. SIMULATION 
 
The principal purpose of the Si te B survey was to gather data to facilitate testing and 
refinement of the Parker Centre TCB model.  As much of the background stream flow 
rate data pertaining to Site B at the time  of the survey has not been obtained, some 
follow up contact with site per sonnel outside of the MERIWA M384 project period will 
be required in order to underta ke full analysis of the data as planned. The principal 
purpose for which the survey work was undertaken (data gathering to aid model 
development) has nevertheless been sati sfied during the project period.  
  
6. COLNCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
A basic cyanide speciation survey was carried out at Site B to aid the development 
and testing of the Parker Centre Total Cyanide Balance Model . The data indicated 
that around half of the cyanide in the leach tanks was present as titrateable 
(predominantly “free”) cyanide, with copper  and iron complexes accounting for most 
of the remaining cyanide. Speciation through the Site B tanks is remarkably 
consistent. There is a significant le vel of the de gradation product thiocyanate 
recirculating in the plant solution. Site B data will be used for further testing and 
validation of the Parker Centre TCB m odel as the program operation is refined.

 150APPENDIX 3 – REVIEW OF SITE  C CYANIDE SPECIATION SURVEY 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
A cyanide speciation survey of Site C CIL/ Adsorption circuits (flotation tailings and 
calcine) and associated tailings deposition and return water storage areas was conducted on November 14
th, 2007, pursuant to the objec tives of the Sustainable 
Cyanide Management module of the project. The primary aim of this module is to 
provide sponsors with the knowledge and t ools to ensure that the total management 
of cyanide meets all recognised benchmar ks of community acceptance. The site 
survey permitted data gathering to facilitate further development and refinement of 
the simulation mass balance model designed to predict behaviour of all cyanide 
species on a mining lease.    
2. CIRCUIT OVERVIEW 
 
The cyanide survey at Site C assessed 3 general areas: 
 
• Flotation Tails or Direct Leach (High Grade) CIL circuit 
• Refractory Plant (Calcine) CIL circuit 
• Tailings Storage Facilit y and Process Water Dam system including Paste 
Plant discharge. 
 The flotation tails leach circuit at Site  C, which underwent expansion in 2006/07, 
consists of a leach feed (flotati on tails) thickener feeding 2 x 1400 m
3 leach tanks in 
series, with sodium cyanide (30% solution) added to the first (TK 103) to achieve a 
titrateable cyanide setpoint of 270 ppm. Leach feed density is approximately 52% 
solids. Cyanidation leach pulp flows to a thir d leach-only tank of nominal capacity 800 
m3 followed by 6 carbon in leach adsorpt ion stages. The first 2 adsorption stages 
(Tanks 5 and 6) are of nominal volume 800 m3 and the last 4 are of nominal volume 
540 m3.  
 Tailings pulp passes over a carbon safe ty screen and is pumped directly to a 
standard paddock type tailings storage facili ty with constructed earth walls. The 
facility is divided into two discrete square s haped cells with Cell 2 being active for CIL 
plant tailings at the time of the Parker Centre surv ey. Cell 1 was intermittently 
receiving paste plant tailings (high compre ssion paste thickener overflow) at the time 
of the survey. A schematic diagram of the Site C flot ation tailings cyanidation/CIL 
plant is shown as Figure 1 and an aerial view  of the tailings storage facility is shown 
as Figure 2.

The calcine CIL circuit within the refractory plant at Site C consists of a conditioning 
tank, a cyanidation leach tank and seven CI L adsorption tanks. Thickened calcine 
feed from a 4 meter calcine th ickener is pumped to an 85 m3 conditioning tank from 
where it flows through a similar sized le ach tank (into which sodium cyanide is 
added) and 2 more 85 m3 adsorption tanks. Five smaller (49 m3) adsorption tanks 
complete the train. Calcine tailings pass through a carbon safety screen and are Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
 152pumped to a calcine tailings dam. General fl ow diagrams of the Site C calcine CIL 
plant and the flotation tailings CIL are shown as Figures 3 and 4.  
  
3. SURVEY PROCEDURE 
 
One litre pulp samples were collected at each sampling point in wide neck screw top 
plastic bottles and pressure filtered at t he laboratory after pH measurement of the 
pulp. Two x 125 mL portions of cyanide liquor were obtai ned during filtra tion with one 
bottle being pH adjusted to >11 (preserved)  using caustic soda (NaOH) pellets and 
the other left at unadjusted/nat ural pH (unpreserved). The liquor samples were chilled 
for CN
- preservation in transit to Murdoch where silver nitrate titration was carried out 
on both preserved and unpreserved samples (i f titrateable cyanide level was likely to 
be sufficient to measure). Remaining chill ed liquor was delivered  to the Chemistry 
Centre (WA) for cyanide species and meta ls analysis. Three process water liquor 
samples were pH determined and decanted dire ctly into 2 x 125 mL bottles in the 
laboratory.  No duplicate insurance sampling was undertak en at Site C since time on site was 
limited to one day and the number of sample s was significant. Streams sampled on 
14
th November 2007 were as out lined in Tables 2 and 3 which also detail the stream 
measurements that were determined on site and at Murdoch University.     Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology

Pulp pH at Site C is quite low (<9) due to use of hypersaline process water. Thus, 
there is a substantial diffe rence between the titrateable cyanide values determined on 
unadjusted and adjusted pH samples. This is  an example of an operation where pH 
adjustment prior to sample titration woul d be essential to accurately determine 
titrateable cyanide and would greatly improve control of cyanide addition. 
 Titrateable cyanide levels in the calcine ci rcuit are much higher than for flotation 
tailings and despite a substantial decline through the circuit would still far exceed ICMI Cyanide Code requirements for taili ngs deposition. Tailings decant pond 
cyanide levels are below 20 ppm titrateable cyanide.   
  
4. RESULTS 
 
4.1 Speciation Assays 
 
Full cyanide and metal species assay results for all streams sampled at Site C are 
provided in Table 4.  The following general comments apply to the tabulated results: 
 1. Pulp pH levels in both the flotation taili ngs CIL and calcine CI P circuits are low 
as noted in Section 3 and decline to only slightly alkaline (7.5) in tailings 
decant water. 
 2. WAD cyanide level in float tails CIL circ uit tailings discharging  into Cell 2 was 
just above the limit recommended for av ian wildlife exposure (50 ppm) but 
attenuated to less than 20 ppm in the decant pond and in su bsequent process 
water storage.  
 3. WAD cyanide levels in the calcine CIP circuit far exceed safe levels for avian 
wildlife and it is understood that cy anide destruction is undertaken on the 
calcine CIP tailings. 
 
4. Thiocyanate is present in Float tail ings CIL pulp at 20- 30 ppm and in Calcine 
CIP pulp at 60-70 ppm but little additional th iocyanate appears to be 
generated in these systems. The majority  of this species thus appears to be 
present as a recirculating load, with long term losses via degradation and/or 
precipitation into c onsolidated tailings.  
 5. Negligible levels of cyanate were det ected in the Site C cyanidation circuits. 
 Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
 1566. Copper and iron are the most signific ant cyanide complexing base metals 
present in the Float Tails leach circuit but at 10 and 20 ppm respectively, they 
account for less than 25% of the cyanide present. In the Calcine CIP circuit, zinc and nickel are also significant  cyanide complexing agents and the 4 
metals account for nearly half the cyani de present in Calc ine CIP tailings. 
Figures 5, 6 and 7 show the percentage  of cyanide present as different 
species in Tanks 103, 104 and 10 and Figures 8 and 9 show the cyanide 
breakdown in the Calcine CIP first leach and final adsorption stage. Note that 
thiocyanate and cyanate are not generally  regarded as cyanide species but 
rather as degradation products and are thus not included in these graphs. Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology

In the float tails system with low solution metal concentrati ons, the majority of cyanide 
is present as titrateable (predominantly “f ree” cyanide), even in the final adsorption 
stage but the higher metal co ncentrations in the Calcine circuit result in a more 
significant redistribution of cyanide form through the system. 
 
4.2 WAD Cyanide Calculation Check 
 
An analysis was conducted on the cyanide speciation assays to compare WAD 
cyanide level as determined by assay with a value calculated from titrateable cyanide 
plus the principal WAD cyanide metal spec ies copper and nickel. Data from this 
analysis are shown in Table 5.   Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology

The figures show that the calculated WA D cyanide, estimated from titrateable 
cyanide and metal assays, provides a reasonable estimate of WAD cyanide, 
particularly in the Float Tails CIL circuit where it would be within the error of the 
analysis. The difference is more pronounced in  the Calcine circuit where a greater 
range of metals are likely to contribute to the WAD cyanide matrix. For routine 
monitoring of WAD cyanide in  the Float Tails circuit, simple onsite measurements of 
titrateable cyanide and copper (and Ni) conc entrations can provide a good estimate 
of WAD, without the need for full WAD CN assays. 
  
5. SIMULATION 
 
The principal purpose of the Si te C survey was to gather dat a to facilitate testing and 
refinement of the Parker Centre TCB model. Some specific aspects of the model that 
required to be tested using the Site dat a are covered in following sections.  
 
5.1 Data Interpolation 
 The input data requirements for the TCB m odel vary significantly depending upon the 
complexity of the circuit and the availability of data. In the tank system the minimum 
data requirement is to have cyanide spec ies and some metal assays for the first Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
 161leach stage and the final adsorption stage. If no more tank assay data than this are 
available, the model is r equired to interpolate the cyanide deportment in the 
intermediate stages and an algorithm was developed fo r this purpose based on data 
collected in previous projects. Site C data have been used to validate the tank 
interpolation calculation with actual WAD cyanide assays shown alongside the WAD 
CN assays predicted by the model in Table 6.

For Site C the model interpolat ion is found to be quite sati sfactory for the Float Tails 
circuit, although there is a mini “peak” in m easured WAD cyanide level in Tank 3 (first 
adsorption stage) that is not replicated. The Calcine circuit is more difficult to 
interpolate and some refinement to the al gorithm is suggested to be necessary for 
high cyanide level calcine circuits. 
 
5.2 Dynamic Cyanide Flow Prediction 
 
The Parker Centre TCB model has a dynamic  cyanide flow calculation component for 
predicting the areas of cyanide loss as de scribed in previous AM IRA P420C reports – 
“Parker Centre Total Cyanide Balance Model – Introductory Guide and Users 
Manual”,  G Wardell-Johnson, March 2006, “Total  Cyanide Balance Model – Progress 
Report”, W Staunton and G Wardell-Johnson,  December 2006 and “Total Cyanide 
Balance Model – Recent Deve lopments” W St aunton, May 2007. Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
 162 
The areas of cyanide loss as defined in the model are:  
• As gaseous HCN volatilis ed from the leach/ads orption tank system. 
 
• As gaseous HCN volatilised from t he residue storage beach area between the 
discharge spigot and the c entral decant solution pond. 
 
• As gaseous HCN volatilised from the open ponded water bodies including 
residue decant pond and process water dams. 
 
• As ammonia generated electrolytically at the electrowinning cell cathodes. 
 In addition to these areas of “loss” from the site  containment system, cyanide 
degrades and is lost for the purposes of effective use as a bona fide gold leaching 
reagent in the following areas:  
• Conversion to cyanate and thiocyanate in  the leach tanks and hydrolysis and 
precipitation of t hese compounds in the residue storage area. 
 
• Complexation (both reversible and irreve rsible) with other metal species in 
solution (eg copper, nickel,  iron and zinc) and precip itation as insoluble and 
environmentally inactive specie s in consolidated residue. 
 These forms of cyanide “loss” are tracked in  the TCB model and a proportion of the 
cyanide introduced to the circuit can remain in  solution as a circulating load for some 
time.  It was intended that data from Site C be used in the testing of the prototype version of 
the TCB but major design and operating par ameters relevant to the cyanidation 
circuits at Site C have not been able to be obtained from site to this time, thus limiting 
the potential for testing of the dynamic cyanide flow aspe cts of the model. Further 
analysis of Site C data is pl anned as the TCB model is re fined outside of the project 
period and further follow up contact with site  personnel will be und ertaken pursuant to 
these activities. Once the major flow data are available, the m odel outputs on cyanide 
flows will be conveyed to the site in a supplementary report. T he primary purpose for 
which the survey work was undertaken (dat a gathering to aid model development) is 
considered to have been fully satisfied.

 1636. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
A basic cyanide speciation survey was carri ed out at Site C to aid the development 
and testing of the Parker Centre Total Cyanide Balance Model . The data indicated 
that the majority of the cy anide in the Flotation Tailings  CIL leach tanks was present 
as titrateable (predominantly “free”) cyanide due to relatively low levels of cyanide 
complexing base metals in solution. In the Calcine CIP circuit, base metals are more 
significantly solubilised by cyanide and thus  tie up about half the cyanide present in 
CIP tailings. An estimate of the forms of  cyanide loss from the cyanide discharging 
into the tailings dam area is not possi ble with the supporting data so far obtained 
from site but it could be pr edicted from the titrateable cyanide levels in spigot 
discharge and centre decant solutions that more than half the tailings discharge 
cyanide would be lost as volatilised HCN due to the large beach area and significant 
surface area of supernatant solution. There is a modest level of the degradation 
product thiocyanate recirculating in the plan t solution. Site C data will be used for 
further testing and validati on of the Parker Centre TCB model as the program 
operation is refined and other supporting da ta obtained and ongoing liaison with the 
site will be undertaken in this regard.

 164APPENDIX 4 – REVIEW OF SITE  D CYANIDE SPECIATION SURVEY 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
A cyanide speciation survey of Site D CIL/ Adsorption circuit and associated tailings 
deposition and return water storage ar eas was conducted on March 13th, 2007, 
pursuant to the objectives of Module 3 of the Sustainabl e Cyanide Management 
module. The primary aim of this module is to provide sponsors with the knowledge 
and tools to ensure that t he total management of cyani de meets all recognised 
benchmarks of community acceptance. The si te survey permitted data gathering to 
facilitate further development and refinement  of the simulation mass balance model 
designed to predict behaviour of all cy anide species on a mining lease.  
  
2. CIRCUIT OVERVIEW 
 
The cyanidation leach circuit at Site D cons ists of a relatively standard hybrid CIL 
train with 2 leach tanks each of nominal volume 1720 m
3 followed by 6 adsorption 
tanks each of nominal volume 1700 m3. Cyclone overflow slurry at 40% solids feeds 
Tank 1 directly via a trash removal screen with no thickening capacity installed. 
Carbon in the second adsorpt ion stage is pumped forward to the second leach stage 
and flows co-currently with leached slurry in to the first adsorpt ion stage. A general 
view of the Site D cyanidation l each plant is shown as Figure 1. 
 
 
 
Figure 1.  Cyanidation Leach Plant at Site D 
 
Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
 165Tailings pulp passes a carbon safety  screen and has historically been pumped 
directly to a standard paddock type tailings storage facility with constructed earth 
walls. At the time of the Parker Cent re survey, however, tailings were being 
deposited into the depleted mine pit for backfill with decant water reclaimed via a pontoon mounted pumping facility and returned to a process water dam adjacent the 
plant. Monitoring of cyanide water seepage in to the ground around the depleted pit is 
an important aspect of this tailings deposit ion strategy and 3 monitoring bores were 
sampled as part of the cyanide circuit survey.  The Site D process water dam and sample collection of the decant water in the 
depleted pit are shown as Figures 2 and 3, re spectively. A general flow diagram of 
the Site D processing plant is shown as Figure 4.

 3. SURVEY PROCEDURE 
 
One litre pulp samples were collected at each sampling point in wide neck screw top 
plastic bottles and pressure filtered at t he laboratory after pH measurement of the 
pulp. Two x 125 mL portions of cyanide liquor were obtai ned during filtra tion with one 
bottle being pH adjusted to >11 (preserved)  using caustic soda (NaOH) pellets and 
the other left at unadjusted/nat ural pH (unpreserved). The liquor samples were chilled 
for CN
- preservation in transit to Murdoch where silver nitrate titration was carried out 
on both preserved and unpreserved samples (i f titrateable cyanide level was likely to 
be sufficient to measure). Remaining chill ed liquor was delivered  to the Chemistry 
Centre (WA) for cyanide species and metals analysis.  One litre samples of Process water and pit monitoring bore liquor were pH 
determined and decanted directly into and 2 x 125 mL bottles in the laboratory. 
 Streams sampled on 13
th March 2008 were as follows: 
 
• Leach Tank 1 pulp 
• Leach Tank 2 pulp 
• Adsorption Tank 1 pulp 
• Adsorption Tank 2  pulp 
• Adsorption Tank 3  pulp 
• Adsorption Tank 4  pulp Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology

• Mine Pit Feed (tailings at deposition spigot)   
• Pit Return Water 
• Pit Monitoring Bore 1 
• Pit Monitoring Bore 2 
• Pit Monitoring Bore 3 
• Process Water Dam 
 
No duplicate insurance sampling was undertak en at Site D since time on site was 
limited to one day. However, two separate liquor samples were obtained for each 
sample. Table 2 details stream measurem ents that were obtained on site and at 
Murdoch University.

 1694. RESULTS 
 
4.1 Speciation Assays 
 
Full cyanide and metal species assay results for all streams sampled at Site D are 
provided in Table 3.  The following general comments apply to the tabulated results: 
 
1. pH in the Site D l each/adsorption circuit is high, however it reduces 
significantly in water reclaimed from the (in pit) tailings storage facility. 
 
2. Titrateable cyanide level in the first l each stage was significantly higher than 
the average operator titration result r eported for the shift (198 ppm v 127 ppm) 
presumably due to short term fluctuation.  However, the results for the final 
adsorption stage (Ads 6) were comparable (48 ppm v 53 ppm). 
 
3. Titrateable cyanide results in pH adjus ted solutions differed little from the 
unadjusted solution results due to the re latively high pH in this circuit. 
 
4. WAD cyanide level in tailings dischargi ng into the depleted pit was on the limit 
recommended for avian wildlife exposure ( 50 ppm) but this attenuated to less 
than 20 ppm at the pond surface and in the process water dam.  
 
5. WAD and Total CN were detectable at  ppm levels in all 3 monitoring bores 
around the tailings dam. 
 
6. Thiocyanate is present in tank pulp at 60-80 ppm but little additional 
thiocyanate appears to be generated in the leach system and the majority of 
this species appears to be present as a recirculating load, with long term 
losses via degradation and/or precipitat ion into consolidated tailings.  
 
7. Moderate levels of cyanate (80-90 ppm) are present in adsorption tailings but 
this species attenuates by some 20 - 30% in the TSF. 
 
8. Although copper is only pr esent at levels of 10-20 ppm in leach solution, it 
accounts for more than half of the comp lexed cyanide. Iron levels in plant 
solution are very low at 3-5 ppm. Figures 5 and 6 show the percentage of 
cyanide present as different species in  the first leach and final adsorption 
stage. Note that thiocyanate and cy anate are not generally regarded as 
cyanide species but rather as degradat ion products and are thus not included 
in these graphs. Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology

172 4.2 WAD Calculation Check 
 
An analysis was conducted on the cyanide speciation assays to compare WAD cyanide 
level as determined by assay with a value ca lculated from titrateabl e cyanide plus the 
principal WAD cyanide metal species copper and nickel. Data from this analysis is 
shown in Table 4.

The figures show that the ca lculated WAD CN, estimated fr om titrateable cyanide and 
metal assays, generally provides a good estima te of WAD CN, usually within error of 
the analysis. This suggests t hat for routine monitoring of WAD cyanide, simple onsite 
measurements of titrateable cya nide and copper (and Ni) conc entrations can provide a 
good estimate of WAD, without the need for full WAD assays.   
5. SIMULATION 
 
The principal purpose of the Site D survey was to gather data to facilitate testing and 
refinement of the Parker Cent re TCB model. Some specific  aspects of the model that 
required testing using the Site D data are covered in following sections.  
 
5.1 Data Interpolation 
 
The input data requirements for the TCB m odel vary significantly depending upon the 
complexity of the circuit and the availabilit y of data. In the tank system, the minimum 
data requirement is to have cyanide species and some metal assays for the first leach stage and the final adsorption stage. If no more tank assay data than this are available 
the model is required to inte rpolate the cyanide deportment in the intermediate stages 
and an algorithm was developed for this pur pose based on data colle cted in previous 
projects. Site D data have been used to validat e the tank interpolat ion calculation with Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology

For Site D the model interpolation is found to be quite satisfacto ry, although clearly the 
mini “peak” in measured WAD CN level in Tank 3 (first adsorption stage) is not 
replicated. Site D cyanide data do not indica te a need for alteration of the tank cyanide 
interpolation basis.  
5.2 Dynamic Cyanide Flow Prediction 
 
The Parker Centre TCB model has a dynami c cyanide flow calculation component for 
predicting the areas of cyanide loss as descr ibed in previous AMIRA P420C reports – 
“Parker Centre Total Cyanide Balance Model  – Introductory Guide and Users Manual”,  
G Wardell-Johnson, March 2006, “Total Cy anide Balance Model – Progress Report”, W 
Staunton and G Wardell-Johnson, December 2006 and “Total Cyanide Balance Model – 
Recent Developments” W Staunton, May 2007. 
 The areas of cyanide loss as defined in the model are:  
• As gaseous HCN volatilis ed from the leach/ads orption tank system. 
 
• As gaseous HCN volatilised from the residue storage beach area between the 
discharge spigot and the c entral decant solution pond. 
 
• As gaseous HCN volatilised from t he open ponded water bodies including residue 
decant pond and process water dams. 
 
• As ammonia generated electrolytically at the electrowinning cell cathodes. 
 Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
174 In addition to these areas of “loss” from the site containment system, cyanide degrades 
and is lost for the purposes of effective use as a bona fide gold leac hing reagent in the 
following areas:  
• Conversion to cyanate and thiocyanate in the leach tanks and hydrolysis and 
precipitation of t hese compounds in the residue storage area. 
•  
• Complexation (both reversible and irrevers ible) with other metal species in solution 
(eg copper, nickel, iron and zinc) and precipitation as insoluble and 
environmentally inactive specie s in consolidated residue. 
 These forms of cyanide “loss” are tracked in the TCB model and a proportion of the 
cyanide introduced to the circuit can remain in solution as a circulating load for some 
time.  Data from Site D has been tested in the pr ototype version of the TCB and outputs with 
respect to cyanide fate in tailings dispos al system are summarised in Figure 7.

175 The data indicate that over half (61.1%) of  the units of CN that  discharge from the 
tailings spigot are lost fr om the site storage systems as HCN volatilised from the 
relatively large surface area of the pit supernat ant pond. Very little cyanide is lost on the 
“beach” which in this case is only a few mete rs of pit wall. Approx imately 15.3% of the 
cyanide entering the tailings dam is retur ned to the plant storage ponds/tanks for reuse 
and approximately 22% consolidates into high density settled residue for long term 
storage as various insoluble cyanide compounds.   Note also that there is reasonably good agreement betw een model-calculated return 
water flowrate and actual reported flowrate (286 v 265 m
3/h) and also between model-
predicted total CN in return water (12.6 ppm) and actual assay result (19 ppm). This is 
somewhat fortuitous as the model relies on empirical predictions of average settled 
density in the tailings dam and rates of cyanide “loss” to volatilisation and consolidation 
but provides encouragement as to the validi ty of the TCB model for such purposes as 
NPI cyanide emission estimation. Whereas the model predictions regarding dynamic 
cyanide flow are intuitively correct, they ar e only a guide as the TCB is an empirical 
model and the actual cyanide fate in thes e streams will vary with seasonal conditions 
and plant practices.  
5.3 Further Data Analysis and Model Testing 
 
Further analysis of the data is planned as the model is refined outside of the MERIWA 
M384 project period and some follow up c ontact with site personnel is expected 
pursuant to these activities. The primar y purpose for which the survey work was 
undertaken (data gathering to aid model development) is considered to have been fully satisfied.    
6. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
A basic cyanide speciation survey was carried out at Site D to aid the development and testing of the Parker Centre Total Cyanid e Balance Model. The data indicated that the 
majority of the cyanide in the leach tan ks was present as titrateable (predominantly 
“free”) cyanide due to relatively low leve ls of cyanide complexing base metals in 
solution. More than half of the cyanide dischar ging into the depleted pit tailings disposal 
area is lost as volatilised HCN due to the la rge surface area of supernatant solution. 
There is a modest level of the degradat ion products thiocyanate and cyanate 
recirculating in the plant so lution. Site D data will be used for further testing and 
validation of the Parker Centre TCB m odel as the program operation is refined.

177 APPENDIX 5 – A REVIEW OF TECHNOL OGIES USED FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF 
CYANIDE FROM WASTE STREAMS 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Detoxification of cyanide in tailings or wa stewaters may be necessary because of one or 
more of the following factors:  
• Regulatory authorities imposing limitations on effluent discharge, 
• Sites located in regions  where precipitation exce eds evaporation making it 
necessary to discharge water from the tailings dam, 
• Proximity to environmentally sensitive areas, 
• Treatment processes may also be associ ated with reducing t he metal content of 
the effluent, 
• Concern about the possibility of  birdlife/animal mortalities. 
 
These issues are particularly relevant to the North American sit uation where increased 
environmental awareness and rigid regulati ons governing the discharge of waste have 
generated a resurgence of inte rest in treatment options for mine wastewaters. The 
physical and chemical factor s listed above are not usually applicable to gold mining 
operations in Australia and natural degradation is genera lly the favoured option for 
cyanide removal. However, in recent y ears there have been several highly publicised 
cases of birdlife fatalities in tailings dam s, which have emphasised the need for careful 
cyanide tailings management.  The selection of a particular effluent treat ment process will depend on a variety of 
factors including:  
• The mineralogy of the material being processed (this will impact upon the 
constituents in the feed solution to effluent treatment), 
• The required final co mposition of the effl uent (both in terms of cyanide levels and 
heavy metal content), 
• The volume of effluent to be treated, 
• The availability and cost of reagents,  
• Any applicable legislation which may lim it the use of some reagents, and 
• Possible adverse effects on the gold recovery process by recycling treated 
solution. 
 Free cyanide is a relatively reactive specie s and is readily destroyed/removed by most 
treatment techniques. However,  effluent solutions from CIP/ CIL circuits usually contain 
metal cyanide complexes and other cyanide reaction products such as thiocyanate and 
cyanate, which will limit the number of ava ilable treatment options . Chemical treatment Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
178 methods remain the preferred choice, wit h recent developments focusing on the 
combination of one or more methods to prov ide a more efficient destruction process. 
There also appears to be a renewed interest in  biological oxidation,  in particular its 
application in the detoxification of s pent heap leach pads. Other, less well-known 
techniques covered in this review incl ude anodic oxidation a nd photolytic cyanide 
destruction.  Options for the recovery and recycling of cy anide have been cove red in a separate 
review, released in January 2005.  
1.1 Terminology 
 
The term “cyanide” is a general designation, usually covering three classifications of 
cyanide species. In most cases, regulatory authorities specify whic h of these classes 
must satisfy the discharge criter ia imposed and for this reason it is critical to understand 
the differences between the classificati ons. The three classes of cyanide are: 
 
• Total cyanide, 
• Weak acid dissociable (WAD) cyanide, and 
• Free cyanide 
 
Figure 1.1 shows how the various cyanide species are categorised. 
 
Figure 1.1. Classification of Cyanide Species (Botz, 2001) 
 
 In the majority of situations, WAD cyanide is the most appropriate choice of regulatory 
limit as this includes free cyanide, the most  toxic of the classifications, and moderately

2. CHEMICAL TREATMENT 
 
2.1 INCO SO
2/Air 
 
Devuyst et al. (1982) first r eported on a method for the treat ment of copper containing 
cyanide wastewater with sulf ur dioxide/air in 1982 in which both free and complexed 
cyanide are oxidised to cyanate in the pH range 8 to 10 (controlled by lime addition). This technique can be used to remove cyani de bound to iron by precipitation as an 
insoluble ferrocyanide salt, while other base  metals are removed as hydroxides. The 
cyanide oxidation reaction is catalysed by the presence of copper and additional copper 
may need to be added to the effluent stream (as solid or solution) if natural levels are 
not high enough to effect rapid oxidation. The process has been found to be applicable 
to gold and silver circuit barren solutions and slurries. 
 The overall reaction for cyani de oxidation is given as: 
  CN
-  +  SO2  +  O2  +  H2O        CNO-  +  H2SO4 
 
Sulfur dioxide can be supplied as a gas, as sulfurous acid or as a soluble sulfite or 
bisulfite. Although t he theoretical sulfur dioxide re quirement is 2.46 kg/kg of CN -, 
observed sulfur dioxide consum ptions are in the range 3.5 to 4.5 kg/kg depending on 
operating conditions and composition of the effluent stream (Botz,  2001). Temperature 
has no significant effect on the initial cyani de oxidation rate in the range from 5 to 60 oC 
but lower residual cyanide levels are obtained at high temperature (Devuyst et al., 
1984).   Typically, the process is capable of reduc ing total cyanide from 50-2,000 mg/L in the 
feed to less than 2 mg/L in the effluent st ream. Usually 5-20% of  the thiocyanate will 
also be oxidised during the continuous cy anide removal operation. In some cases, 
solutions and slurries treated with this proc ess may be of suitable quality to permit their 
discharge. Since its development, the I NCO cyanide destruction process has been 
licensed to over 80 mining sites in 20 countries and in 20 01 it was reported that the 
practice was still in operation at over 30 sites worldwide (Botz, 2001). 
 
2.1.1 Application Case St udy – Henty Gold Limited 
 
At the Henty Gold Mine in Tasmania high ra infall (3.6 m annually) and limited sunlight 
(average of 4.8 hours/day) restrict the use of  natural degradation as the sole means of Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
180 cyanide destruction. Because the mine is locat ed in a highly sensit ive environment, the 
license conditions, approved by the Tasmanian Government in 1990, stated that a batch 
detoxification process would be required to reduce residual cyanide levels before the 
slurry was discharged from t he detoxification circuit (Austr alian Government Department 
of the Environment and Heritage W ebsite, http://www.deh.gov.au/). 
 After extensive test work, calcium hypoch lorite was adopted init ially as the batch 
detoxification process. Further  detoxification test work wa s subsequently undertaken to 
assess the effectiveness of the INCO SO
2/air process. This study concluded that 
relative to calcium hypochlor ite, the INCO process result ed in more effective cyanide 
destruction, reduced reagent consumptio n and cost, and was better suited to 
continuous treatment. An INCO SO 2/air detoxification plant was commissioned at Henty 
in November 1997.  Prior to detoxification, the slurry is thick ened and the overflow water that contains most 
of the residual cyanide is retu rned to the leach circuit via process water addition. The 
treated slurry is then discharged to leac h residue ponds once the WAD cyanide level is 
below 2 mg/L. WAD cyanide is reduced further  by natural degradation in the ponds and 
when the concentration in the supernatant liquor falls below 0.05 mg/L, it is discharged 
into the environment.  In June 2003 it was reported t hat the detoxification plant had been in full operation for 
5½ years with no operati onal problems (2002 Henty Sust ainability Report at the 
Australian Government Department of t he Environment and Heritage Website, 
http://www.deh.gov.au/industry/corporate/re porting/reports/pubs /henty02.pdf). WAD 
cyanide concentrations are gener ally orders of magnitude below compliance limits. The 
average WAD cyanide concentration is 0.15 mg /L for discharges from the process plant 
to the leach residue ponds after detoxificat ion. Discharge liquor from the discharge pond 
contains an average of 0.012 mg/L WAD cy anide, well below the regulatory discharge 
limit of 0.05 mg/L, and is considered to pos e no threat to aquatic, mammalian, bird or 
human life.  
2.1.2 Application Case Study – Newmont Mining’s Ovacik Gold Mine 
 
The Ovacik Gold Mine, located near the west ern coast of Turkey, produced its first gold 
and silver in June 2001 after a one-year tria l operating permit was issued by the Turkish 
Minister of Health. At the Ovac ik Gold Mine there is an effl uent limit for discharge of the 
tailings into the impoundment (1 mg/L WAD cyanide) but none for discharge into the environment (decant water). The INCO proce ss was the destruction method of choice 
because of its proven track re cord and the need to treat a sl urry stream. The treatment 
circuit was designed to destroy 8.4 kg/hr of  cyanide in a tailings stream composed of 
45-48% solids with an initial total cyanide concentration of approximately 180 mg/L. 
 Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
181 During the one year test period it was show n that the average concentration of WAD 
cyanide in the di scharge from the detoxification circui t was 0.06-1 mg/L and that of the 
decant water from the tailings impoundment was 0.04-0.59 mg/L. In addition, heavy 
metal concentrations in the effluent were much  lower than the limiti ng values stipulated 
by European Union regulations for waste slurries permitted to be discharged on to the 
land.   Despite the promising results from the one-year  trial, the Ovacik Mine was shut down in 
August 2004 pending the granting of a permit by  the Turkish Ministry of Environment 
and Forestry to continue the mining operation.   
2.1.3 Performance – Barrick Gold Corporation 
 
Barrick Gold Corporation has used the INCO SO
2/air process for cyanide destruction at 
four of its properties  (Goode et al., 2001). Basic mine operating parameters and cyanide 
detoxification data fo r the plants are pres ented in Table 2.1.

Generally, Barrick’s INCO SO 2/air plants have operated extr emely well to give final 
effluents meeting environmental permits and gui delines. At Est-Malartic the cyanide 
destruction facility routinely reduces Cu leve ls to less than 50 mg/L and WAD cyanide to 
below 10 mg/L. Treated tailings slurry is discharged to a system  of tailings and polishing 
ponds where natural degradati on reduces the WAD cyanide  levels to well below 1 mg/L. Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
182 and copper to about 1 mg/L. Ferric iron is added to the polishi ng pond influent to 
precipitate copper and r educe its concentration to well below 0.3 mg/L.  
 Based on the satisfactory performance of Barrick’s INCO SO
2/air plants, the process will 
probably be used at the 33,000 t/day Pascua gold project located at about 5,000 m 
elevation on the Chile-A rgentina border. Tailings slurry fr om the cyanide leach plant will 
be treated using SO 2 produced by burning elemental sulfur. Tailings decant will be 
recycled to the process plant. Production is expected to commence in 2009.  
2.2 Hydrogen Peroxide 
 
Hydrogen peroxide treatment process chemistr y is similar to that described for the 
INCO process but hydrogen perox ide is substituted for SO
2 and air. The process, which 
was developed by Degussa Corporation, also  requires the presence of soluble copper 
as a catalyst and oxidises cyanide to cy anate according to t he following reaction: 
 
 CN-  +  H2O2        CNO-  +  H2O 
 
In the presence of excess hydr ogen peroxide, cyanate is further  oxidised to nitrite and 
carbonate and eventually nitrat e. Otherwise, the cyanate will hydrolyse to ammonium 
and bicarbonate. The usual conversion rate is  10-20% and is more rapid at lower pH 
values.  Theoretically, 1.3 kg of hydr ogen peroxide is required per kg of cyanide but in practice 
the actual consumptio n is about 2-8 kg H
2O2 per kg of CN- oxidised. The rate of cyanide 
oxidation is directly proportional to the Cu/C N ratio as well as the concentration of H 2O2. 
The efficiency of cyanide destruction (H 2O2/CN) is inversely proportional to the Cu/CN 
ratio since hydrogen peroxide catalyticall y decomposes in the presence of many 
transition metals, including copper, result ing in additional reagent consumption. 
 In theory, thiocyanate can also be oxidised  to cyanate and elemental sulfur by hydrogen 
peroxide but the rate of reaction is normally too slow to be of any significance. Heavy 
metals such as copper, zinc and cadmium ar e precipitated as hydroxides as the cyanide 
complexes are broken down by the peroxi de (Knorre and Griffiths, 1984). Although 
hydrogen peroxide will not decompose the cyanide in the iron cyanide co mplex, it will 
reduce ferricyanide to ferrocyani de (Griffiths, 1988). This reaction forms the basis of the 
second stage of the Degussa process in which reddish-bro wn copper ferrocyanide, a 
solid of very low solubility at pH<9, is precipitated and remo ved from the system. 
Maintaining a pH of 8.5 ensures low levels of  total cyanide in the treated effluent while 
minimising levels of soluble copper (solubi lity of copper hydrox ide increases with 
decreasing pH).  Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
183 One perceived environmental ad vantage of a hydrogen peroxide system is that excess 
reagent decomposes to give  water and oxygen, leaving no unwanted salts or toxic 
residues (Griffiths et al., 1987), although, as mentioned above, this can also have a 
detrimental effect on reagent consumption:   2H
2O2        O2  +  2H2O 
 
In general, it has been found t hat the treatment of cyanide containing slurries with 
hydrogen peroxide is uneconomical due to  the high reagent c onsumption and the 
primary application of the process is for t he treatment of solutions. The process is 
typically applied to treat re latively low concentrations of cyanide to achieve cyanide 
levels that may be suitable for discharge (Botz, 2001).  
2.2.1 Application Case Study  – Barrick Gold Corporation 
 
The Pierina heap leach operati on is located in Peru and pr ocesses over 16 Mt/a of 
silver-gold ore. During the Peruvian rainy season, Pierina produc es excess solution 
which must be treated to remove WAD cyani de to levels less than 0.005 mg/L before it 
can be discharged. This is achieved by a combination of cyanide destruction and 
dilution using excess non-cyanide bearing solu tions which arise on site. An alkaline 
chlorination facility was originally install ed at Pierina and was operated for one year. 
However, high operating costs, unsatisfa ctory performance and safety concerns 
resulted in the plant being converted to copper catalysed hydrog en peroxide in early 
2000. The treatment system comprises reacto rs and a thickener for the removal of 
precipitated metals. Treated effluent passes through a polishing pond prior to discharge.  
 During the 2000 rainy season, 72,000 m
3 of solution containi ng about 250 mg/L free 
cyanide and 500 mg/L WAD cyanide were treat ed to produce effluent containing less 
than 0.1 mg/L WAD cyanide. Treatment  costs using hydrogen peroxide were 
approximately 60% of those for alkaline ch lorination and it was anticipated that 
eventually this figure would be reduc ed to less than 50% (Goode et al., 2001). 
 
2.2.2 Application of Hydrogen Peroxide to  the Treatment of Tailings Slurries 
 
Hydrogen peroxide was first pilot tested on a continuous scale at the Lead, South 
Dakota operation of Homestak e Mining Company in the early 1980s. The first full scale 
hydrogen peroxide treatment fac ility in the mining industr y was built and operated by 
Degussa at the Ok Tedi Mine in Papua New Guinea . Although in this case detoxification 
was performed successfully on tailings slu rry, as mentioned previously, the use of 
hydrogen peroxide to treat slurries is gener ally limited due to t he high consumption 
resulting from its reaction with solids in the slurry. Furthermore, high concentrations of 
heavy metals in slurries also may lead to excessive decomposition of hydrogen Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
184 peroxide. Application of the Degussa pr ocess has mainly been restricted to the 
treatment of decant solutions.  Recently, work has been carried out to det ermine the effectiveness and kinetics of 
hydrogen peroxide in destroying cyanide in ta ilings slurry from a gold mine with low 
sulfide and heavy metal content (Kitis et al.,  2005). This laboratory scale investigation 
was conducted on slurry from the Ovacik Go ld Mine, Turkey in order to determine the 
effect of copper catalyst and hydrogen perox ide concentrations, temperature and pH on 
extent and rate of WA D cyanide destruction. 
 Results from the work indicated that:  
• WAD cyanide concentration could be reduced from ~60 mg/L to <1 mg/L in 1-2 
hours. 
• H
2O2 consumption was 1.7-5 kg per kg of WAD cyanide depending on the test 
conditions. 
• The impact of pH on cyanide destruc tion varied depending upon the dosages of 
the copper catalyst. 
• Temperature did not affect the destruction process in the range 10-30 oC. 
• Treatment of the Ovacik slurry wit h hydrogen peroxide was successful in 
reducing the WAD cyanide concen tration to <1 mg/L. Howeve r, ore from this site 
is particularly low in sulfide and metals  content and the app licability of this 
method to other sites would need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. 
 
2.3 Caro’s Acid 
 
Peroxymonosulfuric acid (H 2SO 5), also known as Caro’s ac id, is a reagent used in a 
recently developed cyanide treatment process that has found application at a few sites 
(Botz, 2001). Caro’s acid is formed and reacts with cyanide as follows:   H
2SO 4  +  H 2O2        H 2SO 5  +  H 2O 
  H
2SO 5  +  CN-        H 2SO 4  +  CNO- 
 Caro’s acid solution is clear and colourle ss and has an oily consistency. It possesses 
the properties of an oxidiser and a strong acid and has a typi cal solution composition of 
25% Caro’s acid, 47% sulfuric acid, 3%  hydrogen peroxide and 25% water. Since 
Caro’s acid has a limited st orage life, it is generated on-si te and consumed immediately. 
The reaction between Caro’s acid and cyanide is very rapid, being completed in less 
than one minute (FMC Website, http://www.fm cchemicals.com). Caro’s acid is less 
sensitive to decomposition from heavy metals than H
2O2 and so can be used in slurry 
treatment applications. Also, it  can be applied in situations  where the addition of a Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
185 copper catalyst is not desirable,  therefore precluding the us e of, for example, the INCO 
SO 2/air process.  
 The theoretical consumption of H
2SO 5 in the process is 4.39 kg per kg of CN- oxidised 
but in practice 5-15 kg per kg of CN- is required (Botz, 2001). Acid produced in the 
reaction is typically neutralised with lime.  As part of a plant trial, t he raw material costs involved in reducing the WAD cyanide 
concentration from 40 mg/L to 20 mg/L  using a) Caro’s acid and b) H
2O2 alone were 
compared (FMC Website, http://www.fmcchem icals.com). It was found that using H 2O2 
would be greater than three times more ex pensive than using Caro’s acid. The capital 
cost for an on-site Caro’s acid generator  was estimated to be less than US$200,000. 
 
2.3.1 Application Case Study  – Barrick Gold Corporation 
 
Barrick Gold Corporation’s Goldstrike operat ion in Nevada, U.S.A processes over 10 
Mt/a of refractory or double refractory gol d ore. The site includes a common tailings 
storage facility with recycle of excess solution to process. In 1989, Barrick began adding 
hydrogen peroxide to the tailings  pumpbox to control the cyanide  content of the tailings 
supernatant solution to prevent wildfowl fatalities. The result s of this treatment were 
satisfactory but costs were high. In 1994 th e system was converted to Caro’s acid. It 
was found that both techniques were  capable of reducing WAD cyanide to 
approximately 25 mg/L, a level considered to be low enough to protect wildfowl. However, converting to Caro’s acid reduc ed hydrogen peroxide consumption from 0.3-
0.6 kg/t to 0.12-0.24 kg/t and e liminated the need for copper su lfate addition. Sulfuric 
acid requirements for the Caro’s acid proc ess were 0.6-1.1 kg/t (Goode et al., 2001). 
 
2.4 The CyPlus CombinOx
 Process 
 
In March 2003, CyPlus, a wholly-owned co mpany of Degussa AG and INCO Technical 
Services announced the product launch of their newly developed cyanide destruction 
process (CyPlus Website, https://www.m ycyplus.com/). The process, known as 
CombinOx®, is a combination of the Caro’s ac id (or, in some instances, hydrogen 
peroxide) and INCO SO 2/air technologies. It is claimed that, depending on site-specific 
conditions, the new process offers capita l savings over traditional INCO plants and 
operating savings over both I NCO and Caro’s acid technology. In some cases the 
existing detoxification equipment can be used  for the application of CyPlus CombinOx® 
after certain modifications have been made. The design of the pr ocess is based on 
INCO technology and the reagent requirement s include peroxygen, sulfur dioxide, air 
and a copper catalyst. The process is readily applicable to the treatment of pulps and 
produces a treated effluent with a residual chem istry as good as or better than either of 
the two background technologies (CyPlus Website, https://www.mycyplus.com/).

186 The CombinOx® detoxification process was first applied on an industrial scale in 
January 2004 at an Anglogold  Ashanti Ltd gold mine in Ma li. As far as can be 
ascertained, no process evaluati on data have been reported to date. 
 
2.5 Alkaline Chlorination 
 
Alkaline chlorination has been the most  commonly applied technique for cyanide 
destruction but it has gradually  been replaced by other processes and is now only used 
occasionally with application limited mainly to the plating indus try. The oxidation 
reaction will destroy free cyanide and most  metal cyanide complexes but ferro- and 
ferricyanide complexes are not degraded. The process can be relatively expensive to 
operate due to high reagent consumption.  
The reaction is a two step process with chlori ne being supplied either in liquid form or as 
solid sodium or calcium hypochlorite. In th e first stage, cyanide is rapidly oxidised to 
cyanogen chloride, CNCl:   NaCN  +  Cl
2        CNCl  +  NaCl 
 
The reaction is instantaneous and independent of pH. T he cyanogen chloride is then 
converted to cyanate under al kaline (pH 10-11) conditions: 
  CNCl  +  2NaOH        NaCNO  +  NaCl  +  H
2O 
 
A high pH must be maintained to ensure rapid conversion to cyanate and thereby 
preclude the release of highly poisonous cyanogen chloride gas. Cyanate is then 
hydrolysed, in the presence of chlorine, to ammonia and carbonate and if there is 
excess chlorine, the amm onia will react further to produce nitrogen gas, although 
generally, the process is not taken to this stage as it involves unnecessary reagent 
consumption.   In addition to reacting with cyanide, cyanate  and ammonia, the al kaline chlorination 
process will oxidise thiocyanate, which ma y result in excessi vely high reagent 
consumption. Although the stoichiometric chlorine requir ement for cyanate production is 
2.73 kg/kg CN
-, in practice the actual consumption ranges from 3.0 to 8.0 kg per kg of 
CN- oxidised.  
 An advantage of the process is that copper is not r equired as a catalyst as it is with the 
SO
2/air and H 2O2 methods. Upon completion of the cyanide oxidation reaction, metals 
are precipitated as metal hydr oxide compounds. One of the major disadvantages of this 
method of cyanide destruction is the potenti al for formation of chlorinated organics. 
These substances are often more harmful  and more stable than the cyanide itself. 
Generally, the best application of this process is with low flows of solutions containing Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
187 high to low initial levels of cyanide when treated cyanide le vels of less than about 1 
mg/L are required (Botz, 2001).  
2.5.1 Application Case Study  – Barrick Gold Corporation 
 
As mentioned earlier (Section 2. 2.1) Barrick initially insta lled an alkaline chlorination 
treatment facility at its Pier ina heap leach operation in Peru . During the planning stages 
of the operation, it was decid ed to use alkaline chlorinati on because of its successful 
application at other sites and the ready suppl y of sodium hypochlorite in Peru. The 
treatment facility that was installed comprised two agitat ed tanks providing about 30 
minutes retention time each plus other asso ciated equipment such as reagent holding 
tanks, pumps etc. (Goode et al., 2001). T he treated solution was discharged to the 
environment via a polishing pond.   The alkaline chlorination facility was operat ed during 1999. In reviewing the year of 
operation it was concluded that the destruction process was difficult to control, that it 
posed safety hazards, that target effluent WAD cyanide values were difficult to attain, 
and that operating costs were very high at US$6/m
3 of solution treated. After examining 
alternative destruction processes, the pl ant was converted to  the hydrogen peroxide 
system prior to the 2000 rainy season.  
2.6 Chlorine Dioxide 
 
Chlorine dioxide (ClO
2) is a gaseous strong ox idising agent that is effective over a wide 
pH range (Parga et al., 2003). It has a disagreeabl e, irritating odour similar to that of 
chlorine. It is readily decom posed on exposure to UV light and so is always stored in the 
dark. ClO 2 can be handled safely in the gaseous phase by diluting with air or nitrogen to 
a concentration below about 10%. For wastewater treatment purposes, it is only used in 
aqueous solutions and is gener ated on site (Parga and Co cke, 2001). Compared with 
other oxidants commonly used for cyanide destruction, ClO 2 has one of the highest 
oxidation potentials and the highest free reactive oxygen content. It is also about ten 
times more soluble than  chlorine in water. 
 Recently, test work has been conducted to ex amine the treatment of cyanide solutions 
by oxidation with chlorine dioxide in a gas -sparged hydrocyclone (GSH) reactor (Parga 
and Cocke, 2001 and Parga et al., 2003). The GSH technology was originally 
developed at the University of Ut ah for flotation of fine particles  in the mineral industry. It 
is now successfully being used to remove oi l from contaminated so il, volatile organic 
compounds from water, and to treat industr ial wastewaters (Office of Industrial 
Technologies, U.S. Department  of Energy Website: 
http://www.eere.energy. gov/industry/mining/). 
The unit is shown schematically in Figure 2.1 and consists of two concentric right-
vertical tubes and a conventional cyclone header  at the top. The porous inner tube Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
188 allows for the spargi ng of the gas (ClO 2 in this case), while the nonporous outer tube 
serves as a gas jacket and ensures even di stribution of the gas throughout the porous 
tube. Cyanide solution is fed tangentially  at the top through the cyclone header to 
develop a swirl adjacent to the inside surfac e of the porous tube, leaving an empty air 
core centred on the axis of the GSH unit. The high-velocity swirl flow shears the 
sparged gas to produce a high concentration of small bubbles and intimate mixing 
between these numerous fine bubbles of ClO 2 and the cyanide solution occurs. 
Gaseous products are then transported radially to  the centre of the cyclone. The bulk of 
the gas phase moves towards the vortex fin der of the cyclone heade r and is vented into 
an appropriate post-treatment device. The c apacity of the GSH system is 100-600 times 
that of conventional gas-stripping equipment.  
 
Figure 2.1. Schematic Repr esentation of the Gas-Spar ged Hydrocyclone Reactor 
(Parga et al., 2003) 
 
 Oxidation of cyanide with chlo rine dioxide occurs accordi ng to the following equation: 
  CN
-  +  2ClO 2(g)  +  2OH-        CNO-  +  2ClO 2-  +  H 2O 
 The stoichiometry of the reaction indicate s that, under ideal conditions, 5.2 kg of 
chlorine dioxide are required to destroy 1 kg of cyanide. Results from bench and pilot 
scale test work showed that free cyanide  is destroyed at all pH values, although 
complexed cyanide is destroyed more effectively at a high pH. Under optimum conditions, virtually 100% of the free cy anide and nearly 80% of the complexed cyanide 
was removed (an initial total cyanide concen tration of 250 mg/L was reduced to <0.2 
mg/L free cyanide and 53 mg/L  complexed cyanide). Although th is work is still in its 
preliminary stages, it is expected that t he economics of the process would be quite 
Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
189 attractive because of reduc ed reagent requirements compar ed with other destruction 
processes and cost savings result ing from short residence times. 
 
2.7 Ozonation 
 
Ozone is a strong oxidant (stronger than hydr ogen peroxide or chlorine) which will react 
with cyanide producing cyanate. Two mechanisms have been proposed: 
 
 CN-  +  O3        CNO-  +  O2 
and  3CN
-  +  O3        3CNO- 
 
These are referred to as simple and cataly tic ozonation, respectively (Young, 2001). 
Continued addition of ozone wi ll convert cyanate to carbonate and nitrogen gas, but at a 
much slower rate. Laboratory scale test wo rk carried out on synthetic solutions and 
industrial effluent solutions fr om two Mexican mines indica ted that the oxidation of 
cyanide is first order with respect to ozo ne and zero order with respect to cyanide 
(Carrillo-Pedroza et al., 2000). It was also found that the oxidation of cyanide with ozone 
is very fast, with ozone immediately reacti ng with the cyanide up on its absorption into 
solution. Therefore, the rate- limiting step is the concentrat ion of available ozone in the 
gas phase (Carrillo-Pedroza and Soria-Aguilar, 2001).  It was shown that ozone consumption to oxidise cyanide was 1.9 kg O
3/kg CN- which is 
close to the theoretical stoichiometry. Copper  was also found to have a catalytic effect, 
with reaction time and reagent consumption both being halved when solution contained 
185 mg/L copper (Nava et al. 1999).  Ozone is also highly destructive towards thiocyanate and WAD cya nide. Oxidation of 
thiocyanate occurs in two steps – oxidatio n of thiocyanate to cyanide followed by 
oxidation to cyanate. Oxidati on of thiocyanate with ozone can take place in alkaline and 
acid conditions, whereas cyanide oxidation onl y occurs in alkaline conditions (that is, 
HCN is not oxidised) (Kim et al., 2003). Ozone oxidation of thiocyanate has been 
considered as a novel means of regenerati ng cyanide and this is discussed in more 
detail below (Section 2.7.1).  
In addition, Kim et al. (2003) showed that oz one could oxidise more than 90% of iron 
cyanide in solution by also adding hydrogen peroxide and irradiat ing with UV light. 
 One of the major disadvantages  of ozonation is the high cost associated with generating 
ozone. This treatment method has yet to be applied on a pilot or industrial scale.

2.7.1 Regeneration of Cyanide by  Ozone Oxidation of Thiocyanate 
 
During the cyanide leaching process, thiocy anate is formed as a result of reaction 
between cyanide and sulfur species. It ha s been reported that cyanide loss through 
thiocyanate formation may account for up to 50% of the total cyanide consumption 
(Byerley and Enns, 1984). Resultant concent rations of thiocyanate in solution may 
range from a few mg/L to well over 1,000 mg/L  in some cases. Although not commonly 
regulated in water discharges, thiocyanate may be toxic to aquatic species (Botz et al., 
2001). Because thiocyanate is not destroyed in most cyanide detoxification processes, 
an additional treatment technol ogy may be required if thiocyanate removal is necessary. 
Problems of excessive reagent consumption and effluent toxicity may be partially 
alleviated by the regeneration of cyanide by oxidation of  thiocyanate with a strong 
oxidant such as ozone.  The oxidation of thiocyanate with ozone proceeds according to:   SCN
-  +  O 3(g)  +  H 2O        SO 42-  +  HCN  +  H+ 
 The stoichiometry of the reaction indicates that 0.83 kg of ozone is required for the 
oxidation of 1 kg of thiocy anate. Because copper catalyses the oxidation of cyanide to 
cyanate, it is important to maintain low copper levels in  solution (for example, by 
precipitation with a cationic reagent or by oxidation with hydrogen pe roxide) to maximise 
cyanide recovery. In addition, as HCN is not ox idised by ozone, it is necessary to 
maintain an acidic pH. Soto et al. ( 1995) found that regenerat ion of cyanide from 
thiocyanate in cyanidation effluents is possible if the copper concentration is lower than 
10 mg/L and pH of the solution  is kept below 7.0. Cyanide recoveries of up to 90% of 
the theoretical maximum were obtained with a consumption of about 1 kg ozone per kg 
of thiocyanate.  In 1998 and 1999, TVX Hellas investigated t he possibility of regenerating cyanide from 
thiocyanate at its Olympias project in Greec e. In laboratory and pilot scale studies, 
thiocyanate concentrations in the taili ngs ranged from 2.5 g/L to >12 g/L and 
thiocyanate formation was responsible for approximately 90% of the total cyanide 
consumption in the circuit. Options for recovering cyanide from thiocyanate were 
investigated and small-scale pilot testing wa s carried out to assess the possibility of 
ozone oxidation.   Pilot testing involved the continuous pumping of pulp or  solution through a bubble-
column reactor, which was sparged with ozone-containing gas. A test conducted on 
synthetic solution produced an average cyanide regeneration efficiency of 85%, while a 
similar test on synthetic pulp at approximately 40% solids produced an average cyanide 
regeneration efficiency of about 50%. For the latter test, approximately 10% of the free Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
191 thiocyanate was unreacted, 50% was convert ed to free cyanide and 20% was converted 
to cyanate. The remaining 20% was unac counted for in the mass balance and may 
have been precipitated as a metal cyanide and/or metal thiocyanate complex due to 
solution-solid reactions at low pH condit ions. The high degree of cyanide to cyanate 
conversion was probably due to  the presence of copper. 
 Order-of-magnitude operating co st estimates were developed by Botz et al. (2001) for 
the oxidation process based on reagent costs (ozone and lime for neutralisation) and 
power. From these calculations it was determined that the ozone oxidation process 
appeared to be capable of regenerating cyanide for less than the pur chase cost of new 
sodium cyanide.   
3. BIOLOGICAL TREATMENT 
 
3.1 Introduction 
 
There are many microbial species (bacteria,  fungi and algae) that are able to degrade 
cyanide into less harmful by-products. Severa l species of bacteria can convert cyanide 
under both aerobic and anaerobic c onditions, using it as a pr imary source of nitrogen 
and carbon. Other organisms ar e capable of oxidising the cyanide related compounds 
of thiocyanate and ammonia u nder varying conditions of pH, temperature, nutrient 
levels, oxygen and metal concentrations  (Akcil and Mudder, 2003). Although the 
applicability of biological processes for the tr eatment of cyanide solu tions in the mining 
industry is somewhat limited, the tec hnique has been well proven and in certain 
situations it is potentially the most appropriate method of cyanide destruction. 
 A proven example of the effect iveness of biological treatment  of wastewaters containing 
cyanide can be found at the Homestake Mine in Lead, South Dakota (Mudder et al., 
1997; Whitlock and Mudder, 1986). Full-scale operat ion of the treatment plant began in 
late 1984, following seven years of in tensive research, development, design and 
construction. Essentially, the process in volves the removal of complexed metal 
cyanides and related cyanide sp ecies through a combination of oxidation and sorption 
into a biofilm. Metals are also remove d by coagulation/adsorption and ammonia 
concentration is decreased to very low levels through conversion to nitrate (nitrification) 
via a two stage biological process. Any su spended solids in the wastewater are 
removed through classification and filtering. The treated e ffluent from the plant is 
discharged into a creek, which is classified as a cold water marginal trout fishery. 
Homestake Mine’s effluent seasonally makes up a large portion of the flow in the creek 
and it is therefore essential t hat the treated material be of  high water quality. The only 
chemical requirements for the process are an i norganic carbon source to aid nitrification 
and phosphorus as a trace nutrient.  Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
192 Recently, a number of commercial applications  have been developed for active, passive 
and in-situ operations, which involve either  aerobic or anaerobic processes. Active 
applications include the treatme nt of solutions from tailings  ponds and barren solutions, 
passive treatment can be applied to the detoxif ication of heap leach facilities, and in-situ 
anaerobic systems may be used in existing lined  process solution ponds. In general, the 
biological process is restricted to wa stewaters containing WAD cyanide at 
concentrations below 50 mg/L and to temperatures greater than 10 oC. The process is 
most suited to the treatment  of clarified wastewaters and has not been applied to the 
detoxification of slurries.  
3.2 Chemistry 
 
Cyanide degradation under aerobic conditions proceeds acco rding to the following 
equation:  
M
x(CN) y  +  2H 2O  +  ½O 2        M-biofilm  +  HCO 3-  +  NH 3 
 where M = Fe, Cu, Ni, Zn  Metals released during the oxidative breakdown of the cyanide complexes are 
adsorbed/precipitated into the biofilm. The order of rate of complexed metal cyanide 
degradation from the most rapid to the least is Zn > Ni > Cu > Fe. The bacteria involved 
operate in a pH r ange of about 6.5 to 9. 5 with an optimum of about 7.8-8.2 and at a 
temperature range of 10-30 
oC with optimum above 16 oC (Whitlock et al., 2003). 
Pseudomonas  species are particularly effectiv e at cyanide degradation and form the 
basis of most commercial operations.  Thiocyanate degradation is rapidly accomplis hed at an optimum pH  range of 6.7-7.2 
according to:   2SCN
-  +  4H 2O  +  5O 2        2SO 42-  +  2HCO 3-  +  2NH 3 
 For every kg of SCN degraded, 0.34 kg of  ammonia will be produced and 1.1 kg of 
oxygen consumed with little change in pH.  
The second step in the detoxification process involves the nitrification of ammonia using 
a separate strain of aerobic bacteria and is  represented by t he following equation: 
 
2NH
3  +   3O 2        2NO 2-  +  2H+  +  2H 2O 
 Nitrite is an unstable intermediate that is further oxidised to nitrate or reduced to 
nitrogen gas.  Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
193 NO 2-  +   ½O 2        NO 3- 
 One kg of ammonia requires 7.2 kg of alkali nity as calcium carbonate for conversion to 
nitrate and consumes 1.2-3.2 kg of oxygen with optimum pH  of 7.8-8.5. The reaction 
does not proceed below pH = 7.0.  The two types of bacteria in the degrad ation stage and the ni trification stage are 
normally non-competitive and t heir presence is generally only limited by the change in 
thiocyanate/cyanide and ammonia concentrations. As high levels of cyanide and thiocyanate are toxic to the nitrifying bacteri a, an upset in the ef fectiveness of cyanide 
degradation will adversely affect  the nitrification stage. Re covery of the nitrifying 
bacteria is considerably slower than reco very of cyanide degrading bacteria. Thus, 
treatment plant design needs to take into acc ount the rate limiting fa ctor of the slower 
metabolism of the nitrifiers.   Whilst various bacteria have often been selected as cyanide detoxifying microorganisms, cyanide detoxific ation by algae is also possible. Recently, Gurbuz et 
al. (2004) reported on the su ccessful detoxification of cyanide-bearing solution with S. 
obliquus . The authors claim that algae can easily be obtained and cultivated and require 
fewer nutrients than bacteria. Further work is required to demonstrate a sustainable 
continuous process for typi cal gold mining effluents. 
 
3.3 Treatment of Cyanid e Containing Wastewaters 
 
Biological wastewater treatm ent systems have evolved slowly  for a number of reasons. 
These systems require more extensive pilot te sting programs, are perceived to be more 
site specific, are prone to a degree of fa ilure when improperly applied, and are often 
rejected by metallurgical staff and managers wit h little biological exper tise (Whitlock and 
Whitlock, 2001). Nevertheless, there appears to be renewed interest in biological 
treatment technologies due to mo re stringent permitting criteria governing the release of 
cyanide, thiocyanate, metals, nitrates, sulfat es and other species. Several methods of 
biological treatment hav e been employed including: 
 
• Rotating biological cont actors (RBC’s) as used at  the Homestake and Nickel 
Plate mines (see Section 3.4). 
• Passive biological cyanide destruction processes ranging from simple bogs to 
engineered walls. These systems combi ne aerobic cyanide destruction at the 
surface with anaerobic cyanide destruction at  depth. They usually require the 
addition of a carbon source such as ac tivated carbon or ag ricultural waste 
products. 
• Aerobic bio-filters or pa cked bed reactors which are normally fed down-flow on a 
single pass without recycle. Anaerobic ve rsions are usually fed up-flow. Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
194 • Aerobic attached growth systems. 
• Suspended growth systems which include  activated sludge, batch reactors and 
lagoons. The concept is to maintain th e active biomass in some degree of 
suspension. 
 
White and Schnabel ( 1998) and White et al . (2000) successfully used a closed system 
sequencing batch biofilm reactor (SBRR)  for cyanide destruction. The authors 
suggested that this may be a practical system for treating cyanide containing 
wastewater in cold regi ons where a mobile, compact unit with minimal power 
requirements is needed. In addition, because the process is operated as a closed 
system, it can be used in situations where the plant is housed indoors.  As mentioned above, rotating biological cont actors have been successfully applied for 
the large-scale treatment of  cyanide containing wastewaters. RBC’s are attached 
growth biological reactors cont aining a series of closely spac ed circular disks made of 
plastic media mounted on horizontal shafts. Microorganisms can gr ow on the rotating 
disks that are partially (40%) submerged in wastewater and rotated at one to three 
revolutions per minute to alternately expos e the microorganisms to the wastewater and 
air (Kapoor et al., 2003) as shown in Fi gure 3.1. The microor ganisms adhere to and 
grow on the rotating disks, forming biofil ms that degrade organic matter and nitrogen 
compounds present in the wast ewater. Rotation of the di sks maintains a relatively 
constant biofilm thickness and provides the oxygen requi red for the growth of the 
biomass. The advantages of RBC’s are low e nergy requirements, ease of operation, low 
maintenance requirements and mi nimal operator attention. 
 
Figure 3.1. Rotating Biologi cal Contactor Process Schema tic (Kapoor et al., 2003) 
 
 In their paper, Whitlock and Whitlock ( 2001) concluded that the future for 
implementation of biological treatment systems is very bri ght, particularly since recent 
Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
195 advances have clearly demonstrated the viabi lity and cost effectiveness of these 
processes. The increasing r equirement for the removal of  thiocyanate, nitrate and 
sulfate favours the use of bi ological systems and it is anticipated that  the use of these 
technologies will expand over the next decade.  
3.4 Case Studies 
 
3.4.1 Homestake Mine, Lead, South Dakota 
 
Through pilot scale testing, Homestake Mining Company determined that rotating 
biological contactors (RBC’s) were the most  appropriate biological destruction system to 
use as they exhibited the best nitrification.  The final treatment plant design comprises 
48 biodisks with 24 shafts distributed symme trically on either side of the influent 
channel. The wastewater flow is perpendicular to the disk wi th five disks per train. The 
first two disks per train accomplish th iocyanate/cyanide removal and metals 
accumulation by precipitation into the bi ofilm. Cyanide and th iocyanate are degraded to 
a combination of ammonia, carbonate and su lfate. The remaining three disks convert 
ammonia to nitrate through the conventional tw o-step nitrification pr ocess with nitrite as 
the intermediate.  Maximum daily flow of cyanidation wastewater  to the plant is approximately 20,000 m
3/d 
and is a blend of underground mine water and decant water from a tailings impoundment located three miles from the treat ment facility. The ra tio of the blend is 
dependent on seasonal fluctuations and is  determined by thiocyanate concentration. 
Temperature of the influent is maintained above 15.5 
oC, enabling the biological 
processes to proceed efficiently and effectively.  Process flowsheets for the Homestake treat ment facility are shown in Figure 3.2.

Performance data for the Homestake Mine Wast ewater treatment plant are presented in 
Table 3.1. In general, biologi cal degradation and bioa dsorption effectively remove 92% 
of the total cyanide, 99% of weakly co mplexed cyanides and 90 % of copper and other 
toxic heavy metals. Effluent thiocyanate conc entrations are well below 5 mg/L on a 
continuous basis.

197 3.4.2 Nickel Plate Mine 
 
At the end of mine lif e, Homestake’s Nickel Plate Mine in British Columbia, Canada had 
a tailings pond containing water with over  1,400 mg/L of thiocyanate, along with 
ammonia and nitrate levels of several hund red mg/L, which requ ired treatment before 
water could be discharged. RBC’s were not used in this case due to the high thiocyanate concentration and th e concern that RBC’s might  not handle the flow or 
would involve additional capital cost. Fo r the Nickel Plate operation, Homestake 
developed a combined aerobi c and anaerobic multi-stage su spended growth process, 
which includes a denitrification step to remove  the nitrate formed durin g nitrification. In 
this process methanol is adde d as an organic substrate and the nitrate is converted 
biologically to nitrogen gas. A high density sludge system is also incorporated, which 
requires the addition of ferric su lfate to precipitate residual me tals such as arsenic. The 
metallurgical plant was retrofitted to acco mmodate the three stage process. Heating the 
wastewater by about 20 
oC to facilitate biological growth and removal reactions 
enhances the process.   The treatment plant has operat ed continuously since Oct ober 1996, treating flows of 
750-1,100 L/minute. Like the tr eatment plant in Lead, effluent  from the Nickel Plate Mine 
treatment facility contains thiocyanate leve ls well below 5 mg/L. Total costs are 
approximately US$0.50 per m
3 of solution treated. This system demonstrates that 
biological treatment c an operate effectively even in a situation where average winter 
temperatures are minus 20 oC. 
 
3.4.3 McCoy/Cove Mine 
 
At the McCoy/Cove Mine in  Nevada, a pilot plant dem onstration was conducted to 
detoxify cyanide and immobilise several metals  from a process stream (Canty et el., 
1999 and Nordwick and Hiebert, 1999). Testing was performed under the United States 
Environmental Protection Agency’s Mine Wa ste Technology and Superfund Innovative 
Technology Evaluation Demonstr ation Programs. The pilot sca le plant involved the use 
of a proprietary biological culture of mi croorganisms, immobilised on a porous ceramic 
filtration media. The process consisted of a 567 L aerobic reactor followed by two 643 L 
anaerobic reactors and a small 208 L aerobic polishing reactor. The aerobic reactors 
were operated in downflow configuration (that  is, trickling filters), and the anaerobic 
reactors were operated in upflo w configuration (that is, plug- flow systems). Effluent from 
the reactor gravity flowed to a nearby  holding pond (Canty et al., 2000). 
 The pregnant solution to be treated was ta ken from a leach pad process system as a 
side stream at a flow rate of less than 0.57 L/min. The primary obje ctive of the project 
was to reduce the concentration of WAD cy anide in the stream to <1.0 mg/L. This 
objective was developed under the assump tion that the influent WAD cyanide Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
198 concentration would be about 25 mg/L. Tabl e 3.2 summarises the data collected during 
the test period when the system was operating optimally (Canty et al., 2001).

The results show that the primary objective  of the project was not met. However, the 
concentration of WAD cyanide in the infl uent solution was approximately ten times 
greater than the expected value. As a re sult, the average WAD cyanide level in the 
effluent was 26 mg/L, representing an average removal efficiency of 88%. Because a 
substantial reduction of WA D cyanide was observed, the biotreatment process was 
considered successful. Total cyanide was also  substantially removed from the mine 
process water during the field demonstration.  Generally, metal concentrations in the effluent  samples were substantially lower than in 
the influent process mine water. Metal remo val occurred through biomineralization, a 
process by which microorganisms mediate and catalyse inorganic reactions to form new mineral assemblages. In addition, sulfate-r educing bacteria within the bioreactors are 
credited with forming insoluble metal sulfide precipitates through their production of 
hydrogen sulfide.  It was concluded from the results of the pilot- scale tests that the biotreatment process 
potentially offers an innovative, cost–effectiv e alternative for the treatment of mining 
wastewaters. A larger-scale test was recommended to further evaluate the 
effectiveness of the technology  by comparing it side-by-s ide with more conventional 
destruction techniques.    Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
199 3.5 Heap Leaching Applications 
 
When gold production from a heap is no longer cost effe ctive, the process of 
decommissioning the heap begins. The first st ep in decommissioning is the removal of 
residual cyanide from the heap, which often in volves rinsing with wa ter which is then 
pumped to a pond where the cyanide is destroyed. T he treated water can be recycled 
and used for further rinsing. Several rinse cycles are usually required and, in some 
situations, this can take a number of year s. In many states of the U.S.A., a WAD 
cyanide compliance level of 0.2 mg/L must be achieved before an operation is allowed 
to close (Waterman and Lien, 1996).  At the Wind Mountain Mine in  Nevada, indigenous bacteria were grown in a bioreactor 
then added to the barren pond.  Subsequently, the barren solution was used to rinse the 
residual cyanide from the site ’s two spent heaps. The heaps we re rinsed in series with 
barren solution first being sprayed on pad 1 and solution drai ning from pad 1 was 
sprayed on pad 2. Pad 2 runoff was pumped th rough carbon columns to recover gold 
values and finally collected in the barren pond to complete  the cycle. The bioreactor 
was operated continuously for six months with on ly minor downtime. Pad 2 runoff was 
found to meet State of Nevada rinse re quirements of 0.2 mg /L WAD cyanide and 
mercury and silver concentrations decreased dramatically during bioremediation. Pad 
detoxification was achieved while producing sufficient gold values to cover all mine 
costs during the period (Waterman and Lien, 1996).  Pintail Systems, Inc. (PSI) has developed and applied full-scale  detoxification processes 
for spent heaps at several mi nes in the western U.S. (U nited States Environmental 
Protection Agency CLU-IN Website). The bi otreatment populations  of natural soil 
bacteria are isolated and grown to elevated concentrations and applied to spent heaps 
by drip or spray irrigation using the same system originally designed to deliver cyanide 
solutions to the heap leach pads. This met hod of cyanide degradation in spent ore leach 
pads degrades cyanide more quickly than me thods which treat only rinse solutions from 
the pad. A schematic of  the process is shown in Figure 3.3.

Figure 3.3. Pintail Systems,  Inc’s Process for Detoxifying Spent Heap Leach Pads 
 
 Application of the process to a 140,000 ton heap resulted in t he reduction of WAD 
cyanide in the heap leac hate solution to <0.2 mg/L in less than 30 days of operation 
(Thompson and Caldwell, 1997). Copper, zinc, silver and mercury were all removed to levels below drinking water standards. Cadmiu m, arsenic and selenium  levels were also 
reduced significantly. A separate study showed t hat nitrates and nitrit es in the solution 
were reduced to below drinking water limits dur ing the course of bi o-detoxification by 
the addition of specific deni trifying treatment bacteria. 
 Applied Biosciences has developed t he biological cyani de degradation ( BCND
TM) 
process. It is claimed that the process has the following advantages (Adams et al., 
2001):  
• The process degrades all cyanide – WA D cyanide, ferrocyanide, thiocyanate. 
• Different microbes are available that c an degrade cyanide at temperatures from –
4 
oC to >30 oC. 
• The process has been demonstrated to be effective with cyanide concentrations 
up to 350 mg/L and at solution pHs from 7.5 to >11.5. 
• The process can be configured to treat  nitrates and remove metals such as 
selenium, arsenic, mercury etc. 
 Some preliminary investigations have also  been carried out on the use of cell-free 
enzyme preparations as an alternative to live microbial cyanide degradation. 
Advantages of enzymes over live microbes in clude the ability to tolerate and degrade 
cyanide concentrations of gr eater than 1,000 mg/L, nutrients to support live microbial

eliminated, and degradati on rates are increased. 
 
3.6 Comparing Chemical and Bi ological Treatment Methods 
 
Although biological tr eatment methods have a higher capital cost than chemical 
treatment methods, they have a significantly lower operating cost, so that the present-
worth cost is significantly lower for the biological method (Nelson et al., 1998). In 
addition, when a greater emphasis is placed on environmental factors, the balance of 
costs is tipped in favour of t he more environmentally friendl y biotechnology rather than 
conventional chemical treatment. As well as cyanide, related compounds such as 
cyanate, thiocyanate and ammonia can be removed from wast e streams. This is not 
such an issue in cases wh ere regulations governing discharge limits are not as 
stringent.  Biological processes have been pr oven to perform successfully at plant scale in several 
countries and the systems are now well understood. Processes which have been 
applied commercially are as follows (Akcil, 2003):  
• In-plant cyanide destruction 
• In situ cyanide destruction of spent heap leach piles 
• Metal and sulfate removal using ac tive (in-plant) sulfate reduction 
• Limited use of passive processes such  as wetlands and ec ological engineering 
for metals polishing. 
 Results of a study compar ing biological treatment and INCO treatment of cyanide-
bearing wastewater from t he Ryan Lode Mine, near Fa irbanks, Alaska have been 
reported by Nelson et al. ( 1998). A test heap of approximatel y 250 tons was constructed 
at the mine and inoculated with bacteria to determine the costs incurred. These figures 
were compared with those associated with the INCO treatment facility which was 
already in operation. A software package wa s used to generate cost estimate data for 
both processes. The cost analysis indicated t hat the cost of detoxification using the 
INCO process was 2 to 3 times higher than t hat using the biologic al detoxification 
process, primarily due to the royalty c harge associated with t he INCO process. 
 In another study conducted by Clark et al. (2001), six pilot columns (1.22 m diameter x 
6.71 m height) were constructed to evaluat e four biodegradation technologies, cyanide 
destruction by chemical oxidation (hydr ogen peroxide) and detoxif ication by process 
water rinsing. It was found that overall, th e cost for biological  treatment (US$400 per 
ton) was significantly less than for chemical  treatment (US$685 per ton). However, in 
terms of degradation rate, oxidation with hydrogen peroxide generated an effluent 
solution containing <0.2 mg/L WAD cyani de within 36 days, while the best of the Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
202 biological technologies requir ed 151 days to achieve this regulatory limit. The authors 
did note, however, that initial cy anide levels in the test colu mns were significantly higher 
than would normally be expected and cold w eather conditions were encountered during 
the trial. Both of these factors would be expected to have a greater impact on 
biodegradation than on c hemical oxidation. 
 Mosher and Figueroa (1996) co mpared the costs for cyanide detoxification and closure 
of a 1.2 million ton heap leach and a 25 million ton heap l each using a number of 
treatment techniques. These figures are su mmarised in Table 3.3. Although the data 
are somewhat out of date, t hey provide a relative indica tion of the economics of the 
various destruction methods.

4. ANODIC OXIDATION 
 
4.1 Free Cyanide 
 
In cases where cyanide concentrations are high, chemical treatment can become 
expensive and electrolytic destruction can offer a more effective and economical 
alternative. There are two methods used in the electrochemical tr eatment of cyanide 
wastes. The first is an indirect electroche mical method based on in situ liberation of 
hypochlorite by electrolysis of a cyanide wa ste to which sodium chloride has been 
added (Bakir Ö ğütveren et al., 1999). This technique is especially suitable for treating 
wastewater containing less than 500 mg/L cyanide. The r eactions proposed for this 
process are as follows:   Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
203  Anodic reaction: 2Cl-    '    Cl 2  +  2e- 
 Cathodic reaction: 2H 2O  +2e-    '    H 2  +  2OH- 
 In the bulk:  Cl 2  +  H 2O        HCl  +  HOCl 
 Overall reaction with cyanide:   2CN
-  +  5HOCl        2CO 2  +  N 2  +  H 2O  +  3HCl  +  2Cl- 
 The second method is suitable for treating strong cyanide solutions (concentrations 
greater than 1000 mg/L) and involves the direct  oxidation of the cy anide ion to cyanate 
at the anode and collecting heavy metals at the cathode simultaneously. Cyanate can 
be further decomposed to carbon dioxide and nitrogen, ammoni um and carbonate or 
oxalate ions depending on so lution pH. Electrolytic oxi dation of cyanide would be 
expected to require a higher capital cost, but by avoiding consumption of chemicals, it 
should be able to offer a lower operating cost (Cheng et al., 2002). 
 Recently, several studies have been conducted to  investigate the electrolytic destruction 
of cyanide. These have involved the use of  a bipolar trickle tower electrochemical 
reactor (Bakir Ö ğütveren et al., 1999), a porous elec trode rectilinear cell (Sanford and 
Martins, 2001), an electrochemical filter pr ess cell with cobalt oxide doped electrodes 
(Fockedey et al., 2001), a flow reactor (Lanz a and Bertazzoli, 2002), and a capillary gap 
disc reactor (Hussian et al., 1999). A summary of  these results is gi ven in Table 4.1.

In many of the investigations , it was observed that during tr eatment, the rate of cyanide 
removal decreased as the cyanide concentra tion decreased with time. For example, in 
the work carried out by Bakir Ö ğütveren et al. (1999), more energy was used to reduce 
the cyanide content from 30 mg/L to zero  (70 kWh/kg CN) than to reduce the Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
204 concentration from 300 to 30 mg/L (8.75 kWh/kg CN). Moreover, the cyanide content 
could be reduced from 1,500 mg/L to less than 300 mg/L with quite a low energy 
consumption (3 kWh/kg CN). Therefore, operating costs would be expected to increase 
markedly if low levels of cyanide in the effluent are required. High surface area 
electrodes are necessary for improving mass transfer rates (and hence current 
efficiencies) for low solution concentrations of  cyanide. Alternatively, a combination of a 
first stage anodic oxidation and a second stage chemical treatment might be 
considered.  
4.2 Copper Cyanide Complexes 
 
Studies have also been carri ed out on the electrochemic al destruction of copper 
complexed cyanides and the simultaneous reco very of copper (Szpyrkowicz et al., 1998 
and Szpyrkowicz et al., 2000). When this proc ess is conducted at an alkaline pH, 
metallic copper is deposited at the cathode while black copper oxide deposits on the 
anode, which acts as an electrocatalyst for the decomposition of cyanides. The reaction 
proceeds according to:   Cu(CN)
n(n-1)-  +  2OH-    '    Cu+  +  nCNO-  +  nH 2O  +  2ne- 
and  Cu
+  +  e-    '    Cu 
 where n = 2, 3 or 4  Tests indicated that up to 79% of the copper  was removed from solution with 90.3% of 
the recovered copper reporting to the cathode in metallic form and the remaining 9.7% 
being precipitated on the anode as CuO. Approximatel y 78% of the cyanide was 
destroyed in the process. Energy consumpt ion was determined to be 17 kWh/kg of 
recovered copper.  
4.3 Commercially Available Electrolysis Units 
 
An example of a commercially available elec trolysis unit is marketed by Precious Metals 
Processing Consultants Inc. und er the trade name of Gold Bug
® and IonnetTM (Mishra, 
2002). The unit recovers gold, silver and other  precious metals, as well as destroying 
the cyanide. Some of the features of the cell  are the use of iridiu m oxide coated titanium 
anodes, metal coated plastic stiff (sponge like) cathodes, and high speed pumping through the cathode creating str ong agitation. It has been repor ted that 60-80% of the 
free cyanide in 2,000 L of electroplating solu tion was destroyed in 48 hours of operation 
at 400 amps. While it would take more time to destroy I00% of the cyanide than it takes 
to remove all of the metals from soluti on, any cyanide reduction is helpful for total 
cyanide destruction and ultimate disposal of  the solution (Precious Metals Processing 
Consultants Website, http://www.preciousmetals-pmpc.com/
). Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology 
 
 
205  
5. PHOTOLYTIC DESTRUCTION 
 
Photolytic destruction is regarded as t he one technique that is independent of the 
cyanide species present (Young, 1998). Phot olytic methods have been categorized 
according to how the UV radiation is abs orbed and transferred to the material being 
destroyed:  
• Direct photolysis – the material itself is UV absorbing. 
• Homogeneous photolysis – a soluble reagent  is added to absorb UV radiation 
and then transfer the photo-ener gy to the material. 
• Homogeneous photocatalysis – a solubl e reagent is used but does not get 
destroyed in the process. 
• Heterogeneous photocatalysis – a solid se miconductor is used but requires the 
material being destroyed to adsorb from solution to the catalyst surface. 
 Work conducted by Young (1998) involved  comparing heterogeneous photocatalysis 
with anatase (TiO
2) with homogeneous phot olysis with hydrogen peroxide. Results 
showed that cyanide destruction by hydrogen per oxide (the Degussa Process) could be 
improved by UV irradiati on (homogeneous photolysis) and could additionally destroy 
gold cyanide. In comparison, heterogeneous photocatalysis with anatase was observed 
to destroy all cyanide species including both ferric and cobalt cyanide species. Parga et 
al. (2003) suggested utilising this mechani sm in tailings ponds by adding TiCl 4 to form 
anatase and exposing the water body to sunlight, thus enhancing the cyanide 
destruction process.  Soucy et at. (2001) reported on cyanide destruction test work carried out on a mini-pilot 
scale involving the use of thermal plasma s ubmerged in the solution to be treated. In 
this arrangement there is direct and inti mate contact between the plasma and the 
process liquor. Two major energy transfe r mechanisms have been identified – (1) 
localised heating of the solu tion by the plasma plume and (2) a photochemical effect 
produced by the plasma radiati on. Results of the study in dicated that total cyanide 
concentration was reduced from 150 mg/L to approximately 85 mg/L and from 350 mg/L 
to approximately 225 mg/L in 40 minutes. It was concluded that the plasma UV radiation 
effect is the more important of the two destruction mechanisms. At the time of 
publication of the paper, the authors were prepar ing to carry out further testing of the 
thermal plasma destruction technique using equipment with a 20 L capacity.

206 6. COMPARISON OF THE TREATMENT METHODS 
 
All of the cyanide destruction methods have distinct advant ages and disadvantages 
which are outlined in Table 6.1.  As can be seen from the tabl e, there is no single ideal 
method available and all of the pros and cons must be considered when selecting a 
detoxification process. Parker Centre MERIWA Project M384 – Gold Processing Technology

 2097. CONCLUSIONS 
 
More stringent regulatory controls on th e discharge of cyanide containing waste 
streams and the implementati on of the International Cyanide Management Code for 
the Manufacture, Transport and Use of Cyani de in the Producti on of Gold (“the 
Code”) has resulted in an increased interest in responsible dispos al of gold milling 
effluents. There are several well establishe d processes available for the treatment of 
cyanide wastes, as well as some emergi ng technologies which are receiving a good 
deal of attention. Traditiona lly, natural degradation in ta ilings storage facilities has 
been the favoured cyanide treatment method used at Australian gold operations. 
However, it is likely that in the future, alte rnative detoxification strategies will need to 
be considered.
