3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
 
The rapid development and urbanisation of the Swan Coastal Plain in Western Australia (WA), the 
shortage of basic raw materials for const ruction  and landfill  and the poor quality of sandy soils are 
issues of significant environmental, economic and social importance to the State Government. The 
use of by -products to address these issues provide s potential benefits including  reducing 
environmental deg radation and assisting the sustainability of many land uses.  It also addresses the 
issue o f the limited number of sites that are available for landfill.  
In Western Australia, the large volumes of by -products from mineral processing and related 
industries and from the Water Corporation have potential to be valuable commodities. Many of 
these by -products are currently stockpiled, taking up  significant land volume.  
Use of these by -products therefore has potential to  provide both economic benefit and reduced 
environmental impact for industry, agriculture and th e wider community.  However,  there is 
currently no formal or rigorous assessment process for by -products within the WA regulatory 
framework to give both regulators and the industry confidence around comme rcialising and re -using 
these materials.   
As a first step toward developing such a framework for WA, it was proposed that rigorous 
assessment and validation be performed on existing tools that have been used overseas for the 
assessment of by -products foll owing the European Union (EU) and US EPA adopt ed methodologies 
known as LEAF (Leaching Environmental Assessment Framework). As industry and regulators’ 
confidence in the applicability of the methodology grows, a regulatory framework similar to that in 
the EU could be developed  for WA . 
This project aimed to : 
• Assess and validate the LEAF tests and modeling tools  (LeachXS)  for their application to 
determine any long -term environmental impact of using by -products under WA conditions 
with a focus on the Swan Coa stal Plain re gion ; and  
• Develop local capability in WA, currently not available elsewhere in Australia, to provide a 
complete testing, data interpretation and predictive modeling service to the EU and USA 
methods known as LEAF for use in asses sing the suit ability of by -products derived from 
Western Australian waste -derived materials  and recycle materials.  
The project delivered  the following : 
• Validation of LEAF method s 1313, 1314 and 1316 performed successfully by obt aining 
excellent comparisons via a detail ed inter -laboratory trial with the Energy Research Centr e 
of The Netherlands  (ECN) . ChemCentre is now accredited by the National Association of 
Testing Authorities (NATA) for the LEAF tests 1313, 1314, 1315 and 1316 . As a result,  
Western Australian industr y, researchers and government regulato ry agencies now ha ve 
local access to the se assessments from a  NATA  accredited  provider . 
• Large  laboratory  column studies , field lysimeter trials  and data mining  were successfully 
performed usi ng industry by -products on local soil types ;  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
4 • Characterisation  through the large  column laboratory  studies  of the four WA soil types 
studied as controls (with no by -products) ; 
• On-site training  for predictive mode ling and data analysis using the LeachXS  modelling tool, 
and an industry  informational wo rkshop  were completed  with the training delivered by  
acknowledged global  experts  Dr Hans van der Sloot (The Netherlands) and Dr David Kosson 
(USA) ; 
• Validation of the LEAF approach  through successful comparison of  Leac hXS model 
prediction s with experimenta l data ; 
• Establishm ent of  an initial  LeachXS database of Western Australian local soils and by -
product s suitable for t he development of chemical speciation fingerprints to allow robust 
predictions of the potential environmental impact of pro posed or potenti al by -product uses .  
ChemCentre capability will readily allow database expansion  as other soil types and 
materials ar e tested in the future ;   
• Identification of some opportunities to expand the curren t LeachXS database as applied to 
Western  Australian soil s, for example add itional thermodynamic data for key minerals not 
yet represented in the LeachXS database ; and 
• The LEAF  tools can provi de more  certainty regarding the characteristics of by-products  and 
the long -term environmental impact of their  potential  use for specific a pplications in WA.  
Some examples of this are provided  (Sections 5.3, 5.4.1 and 5.5.1 ).

16 1  INTR ODUCTION  
The rapid development and urbanisation of the Swan Coastal Plain in Western Australia  (WA) , the  
existing shortage of basic raw mat erials for construction , landfill and  the poor quality of sandy soils 
are issues  of sig nificant environme ntal, econom ic and so cial importance to the State Government. 
The use of by -products to address these issues  provide s potential benefits of reducing 
environmental degradation and assisting the sustainability of many land uses.  
Ther e are c urrently no specif ic regulatory framewo rks or standards in Australia to enable the routine 
utilisation of industrial by -products in co mmercial infrastructure and develop ment projects. In 
contrast, countries with high re -use rates of these materials such as  USA, New Zealand and pa rts of 
Europe , have well established regulatory frameworks.  
As a first step toward developing such a framewor k for WA, it is proposed that rigor ous assessment 
and validation be performed on existing tools that have been used  overse as for the assessm ent of 
by-products fo llowing the European Union ( EU) and US EPA adopted methodologies known as LEAF 
(Leaching Enviro nmental Assessment Framework). As i ndustry and regulators’ confidence in the 
applicability of the methodology grows , a reg ulatory framework simila r to that in th e EU could be 
developed  for WA . 
LEAF is a collection of laboratory leaching tests, data managem ent tools and leaching assessment 
approaches developed to identify detailed characteristic leaching behaviours of a  wide r ange of solid 
mate rials, inclu ding by -products. The results can then be applied and used to compare scenarios 
representing a range of plausible management options for th e test materials. Assessing the 
applicability and accuracy of the predictive LEA F appro ach in WA requires  evaluation through t he 
use of pilot and full -scale field studies, so that the leaching predictions for a test mater ial based on 
laboratory testing may  be compared with the measured leachate concentrations for that material 
collect ed unde r field conditions .  
With the earlier support and funding from Alcoa of Australia Limited (Alcoa) , ChemCentre has 
successfully set up capability  in WA to provide a testi ng service using LEAF to assess the suitability of 
by-products. These tests were  consid ered  to be general ly applicable to industrial by-products . 
Although the LEAF approach has been validated and applied in Europe, the so il and climatic 
conditions o f the S wan Coastal Plain in WA are significantly different and therefore the LEAF 
appro ach nee ds to be validated  for application on representative soil types  of the Swan Coastal 
Plain .  
ChemCentre, being a scientific government agency, together with the pr oject s ponsors Alcoa, Iluka, 
Aroona  and MRIWA have taken the initiative thro ugh thi s project to valid ate the LEAF approach  to 
address the by -product characterisation requirements for WA in the development of a WA 
framework for b y-product re -use and classification . In its initiative ChemCentre has; (i) ma de a 
significant in -kind co ntribut ion ($150K over 2 years ) to manage  this p roject and develop local 
expertise that is currently not available  in Australia; (ii) been  leading signi ficant progre ss in the field 
of lea ching environmental impact assessment for industrial by -products in WA and i n this Nation; 
and (iii) brought  a divers e range of  industry and the government regulatory agencies together to  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
17 work towards a common achievable goal – maxim ising resource util isation, min imising wastage 
through by -product use and reducing virgin ma terial demand in an envir onmen tally sound manner . 
It is the ChemCentre’s view that a rigorous validation regime on materials relevant for WA  (both soils  
and by -products)  will be required to satisfy the WA Government regulatory agencies and to move 
forward to deve loping a regulator y framew ork, building o n existing experiences with test validation 
and test application in US EPA and in EU ( CEN – European Sta ndardisation Organisation).  
This pr oject addresses the needs of industry and the WA Government regulator y agenc ies to enable 
the bene ficial re -use of by -products  to; (i)  encourage recycling, (ii) reduce landfill requirements  an 
(iii) encourage sustainable industrial practices . The use of by -products would also address issues 
arising from (i) rapid developmen t and u rbanisation of the  Swan Co astal Plain in Western Australia, 
(ii) the potential shortage of quality basic raw materials f or construction and fill and (iii) the poor 
quality of sandy  soils that have limited capacity to retain fertilisers and to attenu ate the  leaching of 
conta mina nts. In addition, t he Swan Coastal Plain region is underlain by extensive groundwater 
resources th at are extremely vulnerab le to contamination from poor soil management practices. All 
this has significant environmental, economi c and s ocial importance t o the community of WA. 
This project aim ed to assess and validate the LEAF tests and modeling tools for  their application to 
determine the long -term environmental impact of using by -products derived from waste -derived 
materials  and recycle  materials  originating in WA  with a focu s on the Swan Coastal Plain region. Field 
evaluation cases consist ed of combin ations of laboratory column  testing and field analysis for 
materials supplied by the industry sponsors of this project and encompas sed by-products from 
Alcoa, Iluka and the Aroon a Alliance of the Water Corporation.

18 2 OBJECTIVES  
The project aim ed to address the requirements for  the development of specific regula tory 
frameworks or standards in WA to enable the routine utilisation of indu strial by -products in 
commercial inf rastructure and development projects.   
As a first step toward developing such a framework for WA, it was pro posed that in this project 
rigorous  assessment and validation be performed on existing tools that have b een use d overseas for 
the assessment of by -prod ucts following the EU and US EPA adopted methodologies known as LEAF 
(Leach ing Environmental Assessment F ramework).  
The assessment and valid ation process in this project compare d results from laboratory testin g of 
each material using the LEAF tests, la bora tory large column testing on field -like conditions, and long -
term field lea ching studies of the material.  Field evaluation cases consist ed of combinations of 
laboratory column testing and field analysis for ma terials  supplied by the industry sponsors o f this 
project and encompass ed by-products from Alcoa, Iluka  and from Aroona of  the Water Corporation.  
The ma jor project objectives were to:  
Assess and validate the LEAF tests and the potential application of mode lling tools to determine the 
long -term envi ronm ental impact of using by -products under Western Australian  (WA)  conditions 
with a focus on the Swan Coast al Plain region. This encompass ed comparison of laboratory testing 
data with field leachate data collect ed for the test materials; and  
Develop loca l capability in Western Australia  (WA) , currently not available in Australia, to provide a 
complete testing, data interpretation and predictive modelling  service to the EU and USA methods 
known as LEAF for use in assessi ng the suitability of by -products de rived from WA by-product  
materials.

20 3   BACKGROUND   
The Government of We stern Australia (WA) recogni ses tha t the Perth and Peel regions have 
significant environmental values an d that important environmental, social and econ omic benefit 
may be derived from implementing a high-level  strategic plan that establishes a vision for f uture 
growth of these regions1. A s trategic assessment1 has been  developed for the protection of matters  
of nat ional environmental significance in thes e regions and it would provide a framework to gui de 
the detailed planning and delivery of housing, infras tructure and services necessary to accommodate 
that growth.  
The rapid development and urbanisation of th e Swan Coastal Plain in WA would need to ad dres s (i) 
the potential shortage of quality basic raw  materials for construction and land fill and (ii) the po or 
quality of sandy soils  for agric ulture  typical of the Perth and Peel regions.  
Many of the Swan Coast al Plai n sandy soils have very low water ho lding capacity, are water repellent 
and also have limited nutrient retention capacity. Thus, nutrients such a s nitrogen and phosphorus 
can leach  into the river systems. Excess nutrients  in rivers, estuaries and la kes can cause algal 
blooms, which reduce pu blic ame nity and can be toxic to humans and aquatic o rganisms. The use of 
soil amendments and conditioners to  solve these problems has been inte nsively researched in WA. 
ChemCentre has participated in a number of  studies  over recent years2-5 in collaborati on w ith 
industry, in particular Alcoa and Water  Corporation, as well as universities and governments 
departme nts.  Projects involving the Depart ment of Agriculture and Food WA and the Swan River 
Trust investigated  the us e of various bauxite residues  and lime amended biosolids  (LAB) , primarily 
for the a pplication in soil amendment5.  The key focus of the research has been to demonstrate that 
these test materials can improve soil quality, i.e. phosphorus retention, c ation e xchange capacity, pH 
buffering capac ity and soil structure.  
Agriculture also suffer s from very  poor and acidic soils on the Swan Coastal Plain. T he use of by-
products  as soil condi tioners and for soil amendment present an opportunity to reduce the l oss of 
contaminants from impoverished coast al soils and in crease productivity through the provision of 
improved retention of water and nutrients and as alternative liming materials  for ad dressing soil 
acidity . 
Another significant issue in Western Australia  is the  large areas required for  land fill sites as part fo r 
land development. Currently alternatives are sourced from existing fragile natural sources a nd/or 
substandard fill is used that  has insufficient capacity to retain nutrients.  
The Western Australi an Wast e Strategy6 Creating the Right Envir onme nt (March 2 012) identifie d 
that the State’s performance in reducing waste volumes historically sent to la ndfill and increasing 
waste recover y rates is poor when compared against other mainland states. As ident ified i n the 
Waste Strategy, in the period 2008 –09 WA had the lowest rate for recovery and diversion from 
landfill of any mainland state, with only 32% of material being recovered and the  remaining 68% 
sent to landfill. The Waste Strategy also identified t hat in 2008 –09, WA had the highest rate of wast e 
generatio n in the country at 2.6 tonnes per capita. With WA’s rapidly  growing population and 
economic g rowth, this is likely to further in crease. The Waste Strategy set ambitious targets for the 
diversion of  munici pal waste, construction and demoliti on w aste, and c ommercial and industrial 
waste from landfill by 2015 and 2020.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
21 Existing shortage of basic raw materials for fill and for treatmen t of acidic  soils  (including acid sulfate 
soils) , particularly sand a nd lime  could possibly be  substituted with  by-products suc h as treatment 
process sediments and sludges from the Water Corporation.  
Using by -products ha s the potential to reduce environme ntal degradation and assist the 
sustainability of many land uses. It also ad dresses the issue on the limited num ber of sites th at are 
available for landfill. This will also provide economic benefit and reduced environment al impact for 
industry, agriculture  and the wider community.  
In Western Australia, the large volumes of by-prod ucts from mineral processing and rel ated  
industries  and from the Water Corporation have the potential to be valuable commodities7. Many of 
these by-products are  currently  stockpile d, taking up significant land volume. Currently, there is no 
formal o r rigor ous assessment process for by -produc ts w ithin the c urrent WA regulatory framework 
to give both regulators and the industry confidence around comm ercialising and re -using these 
mate rials.   
A regulatory review carried out in 20088 found that there we re no s pecific regulatory frameworks or 
Standar ds in Austr alia to enable the routine utilisation of industrial by -products in commercial 
infrastructure and development projects. This cont rasted with some overseas experience, where 
countries with high re -use rates  for these materials, such as the US A, p arts of Eur ope and New 
Zealand, have well -established regulatory frameworks.   
In the EU and by the  USEPA  a parallel development of standard ised methods for the analysis and 
assessment of materials has taken p lace. T hese methods have been validated by the USEPA and i n 
parallel by CEN/TC 292 as standards for the analysis  and characterisation  of waste materials9. The 
methodology has also garnere d support from the International Alumina Institute (IAI) as a method 
for ass essing by-product materials from the  refining of ba uxite7,10.    
Some states in Australia have taken steps toward establishing a regulatory frame work for the 
assessment of by -produ cts. Examples include;  
• NSW (EPA NSW), Guidelines on Resource Recover y Exemp tions (Land Application) (April 
2008 ), Specificatio n for Supply of Recycled Material for Pavements, Earthworks and Drainage 
2010 ; and 
• Queensland  (Department of Environment and Heri tage Protection), Waste Reduction and 
Recycling Regulation 2011, Wast e Reduc tion and Recycling Act 2011 - Approv al of a resourc e 
for beneficial use in 2012.   
However, no such framework exists in Western Australia.  
In Jul y 2014, the Department of Environme ntal Regulation ( DER) released a Consultation Paper - 
Draft Guidance Stateme nt: Regulating the use of waste -derived materials11  for public consultation in 
Western Australia. In this guidance document DER states “DER reco gnises that other jurisdictions 
both within Australia and overseas have mechanisms in place that support  and en courage the use of 
waste -derived mat erials. It would  serve the interest of more sustainable waste management in this 
state to encourage the use o f such materials, where their use d oes not pose an unacceptable risk to 
human health and the environment ”. Chem Centre submitted a response to this consu ltation pap er  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
22 and through Dr Silvia Black has been participating in DER workshops to help inform the dev elopment 
of material guidelines . Sponsors of this project also participated in the DER consultation proc ess. 
As a first step toward developing a fr amewo rk for West ern Australia, it is proposed that rigorous 
assessment and validation be performed on existin g tools that have been used oversea s for the 
assessment of by -products following the EU and USEPA adopte d metho dologies known as LEAF. As 
industry and r egulators’ confidence in the applicability of the methodology grows, a regulatory 
framework similar to t hat in the EU could follow.  
LEAF is  a collection of leaching tests, data management tools and leaching a ssessme nt approaches 
developed to identify detailed charact eristic leaching behaviours of a wide range of solid materials , 
including by -products. The re sults can then be applied and used to compare scenarios representing a 
range of plausible management opt ions fo r the test materials.   
Presently, t he Au stralian St andard Leaching Procedure (ASLP) is widely used in Western Australia 
and Australia. The ASLP method was based on  the USEPA Toxic ity Characteristic Leaching Procedure 
method 1311 (TCLP) , a procedure  design ed to simulate leaching of industria l wastes under a cidic 
conditions within a putrescible landfill .  The main limitation of the ASLP test is that  it only provides 
leaching data for  only one pH value chosen out of three  (pH 2.9, 5.0 or 9.2) , and ther efore m ay not 
provide information on the lo ng-term leaching  behaviour of the material.  Other limitations of the 
current ASLP test are;  
• It does not consi der how the concentrations of const ituents in leachate will vary as the liquid 
to solid ratio changes ;  
• It does  not take into account the amphoteri c nature of comp ounds such as those of As and 
Se;  
• It does not account for the buffering capacity of material s; and 
• It provides no information a bout the release rate of constituents from fill materials.  
The Leachi ng Envi ronmental Assessment Frame work (LEAF ) tests (Methods 1313, 1314, 1315 and 
1316) enable a continuum -based approach to leaching by considering key factors that impact long -
term leach ing under in -situ conditions, such as; pH, liquid to solid ratio  (L/S), rate  of mass transport, 
kineti cs and soi l fabric effects. For instance, in comparison to the ASLP test, the pH dependence test 
(Method 1313) involves  leaching at nine  specified target pH values (pH 2.0, 4.0, 5.5, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 
10.5, 12.0  and 13.0 ), plus the sa mple natural pH and thus c overing a wider pH range (2 to 13).  
With support and funding from Alcoa, ChemCentre has successfully set up facilities in WA to provide 
a testing service using the EU and USA standard methods (LEAF) to assess the suitabilit y of by -
products.  
Although the LE AF approac h has been validated and applied in Europe, the soil and climatic 
conditions of th e Swan Coastal Plain in WA are substantially  different and the refore the LEAF 
approach needs to be validated for application on rep resenta tive soil types of the Swa n Coastal Plain 
in WA.  
This project addresses the urgent needs of industry and the WA Government regulatory agencies t o 
enable the beneficial re -use of b y-products  to; (i)  encourage recycling, (ii) reduce landfill  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
23 requirem ents  and (iii) encourage sustaina ble indust rial practices . The use of by -products would also 
address issues arising from (i) rapid development and urban isation of the Swan Coastal Plain i n 
Western Australia, (ii) the potential shortage of quality basic raw  materi als for construction and f ill 
and (i ii) the poor quality of sandy soils that have limited capacity to retain fertilisers and to attenuate 
the lea ching of contaminants. In addition,  the Swan Coastal Plain region is underlain by extensive 
groundwater resourc es that are extremely vuln erable to conta mination from poor soil management 
practices. All this has significant environmental, economic and socia l importance to the community 
of We stern Australia.  
3.1 LEAF Test Methodology  
LEAF laboratory methods ar e based  on US EPA SW -84611, Test Methods fo r Evaluating Solid Waste, 
Physical/Chemical Methods,  and include Test Method s 1313, 1314, 1315 and 1316.  Each method is 
described below.    
Test  Method 1313 determines how liquid -solid partitioning varies with the  pH of the leaching 
solution usin g a parall el batch extraction method.  This test method applies a full range of pH 
conditions that by-product  materials  may be exposed to in the environme nt, thereby providing a 
high level of confidence in predicting the li kely co ncentrations of constituen ts in leac hates from 
these materials in various settings.  
Test Method 1314 determines how liquid -solid p artitioning (LSP) varies with varying liquid to s olid 
ratios  (L/S)  using an up -flow percolation column procedure.  Thi s test method considers how the 
concentrati on of leachate will vary as the liquid to solid ratio changes.  
Test Method 1315 determines mass transfer rat es of chemical constituents in leac hate from 
monolithic and compacted granular materials (e.g. construct ion mat erials) using a semi -dynam ic 
tank le achin g procedure.  
Test Method 1316 determines how liquid -solid partitioning varies with L/S using a parallel  batch 
extraction procedure.  
3.1.1 Test Method 1313  
The procedure is comprised of nine parallel batch ex tractio ns of particle -size reduce d material  over  a 
pH range between 2 and 13 by the addition of pre -determined amounts of acid or base to achieve 
specif ied final pH values.  
A known mass o f solid material is placed in each of nine extraction vessels and mix ed with  deionised 
water at L/S of 10 mL/g.  Nitric acid or potassium hydroxide is added to each vessel to obtain a 
specified final pH value based on a p re-test pH -dose rate titration curv e.  The nine vessels are 
tumbled in an end -over -end fashion for a tim e comme nsurate with the maximum p article -size. 
Eluate pH and electrical conductivity (EC) are recorded.  Analytical samples are filtered and 
preserved f or chemical analysis.  
Constituent  leachate  concentrations (mg/L) or mass release (mg/kg) are usually plo tted as  a function 
of eluate pH.  Constitue nt concentrations over the pH range typically show characteristic liquid -solid  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
24 partitioning behaviour for cat ionic, amphoteric, oxyanionic and h ighly soluble species such as 
dissolved organic carbon (DOC).   
The r esults of this test are used to:  
• Provide  maximum  (available) solute release values  (“Total Available Content”) ; and  
• Provide  equilibrium concentrations w hen environment al conditions  contro l solution  pH.  
Results may then be used for  geochemical speciation m odel ling to identify likely  solut e 
release -contr olling mineral  phases.  
3.1.2 Test Method 131 4 
Method 1314 is based on a percolation column test designed  to obtain liquid -solid partitionin g (LSP) 
information as a function of L/S).  L/S  is represented as the  cumula tive volume of leaching so lution 
(in litres) passing through a column cont aining a known mass of material (in kilograms). For some 
materials, par ticle size reduction may be require d to meet column dimension considerations  and 
facilitate the approach  to equ ilibrium.  
Solid sample  is loosely pa cked into a glass column and leached  with a percolating eluent  solution at 
low flowrate.  Eluent  is pumped in  an up -flow direction to minimi se preferred flow pathways  and air 
entrapment. Eluates are collected at s pecific  cumulative L/S values bet ween 0.2 a nd 10  mL/g.  Eluate 
concentrations and solute  cumulative release masses are plotted as a function of L/S.  
Met hod 1314 results provide an estimat e of porewater concentrations at low L/S and demonstrate  
how LSP chan ges as solutes  are released durin g succe ssive po re volumes.  
3.1.3 Test Method 1315  
Method 1315 is used to determine mass -transfer based release rate inf ormation from either 
monolithic or compacted granular materials in a sequential tank test. Mass transpor t is th e 
dominant solute release mechanism when water flows around a material with low hydraulic 
conductivity relative to surrounding materials.  This te st is suitable for determining the leaching 
behaviour in monolithic materials such as concrete and geopo lymers.  
As the test materials in this study  do not possess the  appropriate  physical characteristics, the test 
method was not used for this assessment.  
3.1.4 Test Method 1316  
Method 1316 i s designed to provide the  LSP characteristics  of inorganic constituen ts (suc h as heavy 
metals, metallo ids and nu trients relevant to IMG  and non -volatile organic constituents (e.g. 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , PAHs ), analysed as dissolved organic carbon  (DOC)  at the natural 
pH of the solid material as a function of  L/S un der conditions that approa ch liquid/ solid chemical 
equilibrium.  
The eluate concentrations at a low L/S provide insight into pore solution composition either in a 
granular bed (e.g. , soil column) or in the pore space of low -permeability material (e.g ., soli dified 
monolithic or compa cted granu lar fill).  In addition, analysis of eluates for DOC  and of the solid phase  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
25 for total organic carbon  (TOC)  allow f or evaluation of the impact of  organic carbon release and the 
influence of DOC  on the LSP of inorga nic con stituents.  
3.2 Utilisation  of LEAF T ests Data and LeachXS Modelling  Tools  
When assessing the environmental risks associated with beneficial re -use of by-products  for 
application to  soil, WA regulators will consider predicted changes to water quality  at a “ point of 
compliance” (Figure 1).  Dependi ng on the setting, the point of compliance will vary, depending on 
site specific environmental values (discus sed further in Section 3.3).  The LEAF testing  package (LEAF 
test data and LeachXS modelling tools)  can be used to predict the composition of  the “sourc e term” 
(i.e. the conce ntrations of chemical constituents that are likely to occur in soil pore water) a nd does 
not directly indicate impacts on an environmental receptor which regulators  may  consider as  either : 
• Groundwater quality at t he wate r table immed iately beneath the soil  prof ile where the 
amendment has been used;  
• A compliance point comprising ground water quality at the site boun dary where the soil 
amendment has been used; or  
• Concentrations in groundwater at a specific offsite re ceptor (e.g. water s upply bore  or 
wetland).  
The DWE R Contaminated Site Investigation guideline s9 set out the steps for under taking soil 
amendment risk ass essment scenario . The first step in the procedure is to develop a conceptual site 
model (CSM) which is  usuall y a simple ge ological cross section throu gh the application area that 
identifies features such as:  
• The thickness and characteristics of the unsatur ated zone beneath the site;  
• The position of the water table and groundwater flow direction;  
• The charac teristics of the aqu ifer; and 
• The locations  of key offsite receptors . 
As stated earlier, LEAF test data and LeachXS modellin g tools may be used to predict  concentrations 
of leachate from the material of interest passing through the underlying vadose (unsat urated)  zone 
of the soil at the point at wh ich it reports to groundwater.  If the predicted concentrations are below 
the cor responding adopted water quali ty guideline for each constituent, then little or no further  
assessment may be required.  In practice , it is common for o ne or more constituent conce ntrations 
to exceed the adopted water quality guideline; as a consequence of  either higher than ambient 
concentrations in the original soil, or mobilisation of constituents added to the soil through previous 
land us e management by means of changed geo chemi cal conditions (notably pH and redox).  
However,  such exceedances  do not prec lude acceptability of the mate rial as there is potential for 
concentrations of the constituent(s) to decrease in groundwate r by atte nuation  or dilution between 
the source and point of complian ce. Hydrological transport modelling using programs such as 
MODF LOW, may be used to predict co ncentrations of these constituents at the point of compliance.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

3.3 Water Quality Guidelines  
The overarch ing man agement objec tive for the intended u se of by-product  materials on the Swan 
Coastal Plain is to protect the integrity of receiving environments in w hich the material is used.  
Components of the receiving environment requiring protection incl ude the f ollowin g: 
• Groundwate r resources ; and  
• Surfa ce wa ter, including rivers, creeks, lakes, estuaries and wetlands.  
 
MBS Environme ntal and ChemCentre recommend an assessment  framework based on, and 
consistent with the National Water Quality Management S trategy ( NWQMS)8, which adopt s a tiered 
approach for  envi ronmental quality management.  The tiered components of this framework 
compr ise: 
Identification of relevan t Environmental Values to be protected, which may include:  
o Aquatic ecosystem health  (especial ly for Ra msar we tlands with t he Peel -Yalgorup 
region ); 
o Groundwater dependent vegetation health and biodiversity ; 
o Water supply for cur rent and future mining project s; 
o Potential for future primary industry use ; 
o Recreational and aesthetic values ; and  
o Cultural  and spir itual v alues.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
27 Defini tion of Environmental Q uality Objectives (EQO), which may include:  
o Maintenance of ecosystem integrity ; 
o Aesthetic values protected ; 
o Suitability for drinking by livestock and/or native fauna (including birds) ; 
o Suitable for desali nation to  produc e potable wat er or untreated water f or mi ning use ; 
and 
o Cultural/spiritual values protected or enhanced.  
Desired level  of protection:  
o High:  appropr iate for sites that have little or no history of human impact, such as 
Unallocated Crown Land  or proxi mity to  areas of hig h conservation signific ance (Ramsar 
wetlands) ; 
o Moderate:  appropriate for sites that have had some impac t from human activity such as 
agriculture, pastoralism and mining ; and  
o Low:  appropriate for sites with a history of substa ntial hum an impa cts, such as heavy 
industry, intensi ve agriculture or industrial ports.  
Environmental Quality Criteria:  
o Low Risk Trig ger Values ( LRTV ), exceedance of which indicates a measured change to 
background water quality that may be caused by change s in land  use pr actices ; and  
o Investigative Trigger V alues (ITV), exceedance of which indicates a change to background 
water quality t hat may result in compr omised EQO . 
The Australian and New Zealand Guidelines for Fresh and Marine Waters , or ANZECC 2000  (updated 
in 2018) ,8 recognise t he inherent variability  that exists in complex ecosystems and suggest 
development of site-specific  guide lines for key contaminants and may need to consider local 
environmental characteristics when protecting ecosys tem function and diver sity.   
Environmenta l quality guidelines (E QG) a re usually minimum (or maximum in the case of pH 
parameters) threshold numer ical values or narrative state ments which, if complied with, indicate 
with a high degree of certainty that the  associated EQO has be en achi eved.  On the  other hand, if 
the EQG  has not been met, then there is uncertainty as to whether the associated EQO has  been 
achieved and a more deta iled assessment or management response is triggered.  EQGs may be 
considered equ ivalent to the water q uality guidelines (t rigger values) presente d in ANZECC and 
ARMCANZ (2000)8 and other State and National guideline documents . 
EQGs are generally relatively  simple and easy to measure as indicators of environmental quality.  
Field and l aboratory measurements  of phy sicochemical parameters such as pH, total dissolved solids 
(TDS), major ions, petroleum hydrocarbons and dissolved me tals and metalloids are genera lly used 
for surface and groundwater environments.  Compliance indicates a low r isk that the EQO are n ot 
bein g achieved.  If an EQG is exceeded t here is an increased risk that the associated EQO may not be 
met and this signals  the need for a more comprehen sive and evidence -based assessment against the 
EQOs. 
EQGs relevant to the intend ed use of by-product  material s on the Swan  Coastal Plain need to be 
related to the protection of:  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
28 • Groundwater resources for:  
o Agricultural use inc luding irrigation (short term and long term) and livestock stocking 
water ; 
o Domestic non -potable use including washing, garden use  and swimm ing pools;  
o Industrial use (e.g. process water, cooling water, dust suppression , vehicle washing ); 
o Groundwat er dependent ecosystems (aquatic and veg etation) ; and  
o Human drinking water (Gnangara and Jandakot Mounds) . 
• Surface water, including rivers, creeks, lakes, estuari es and wetlands.  
 
The r elevan t published EQGs are collated  in Table 1 and they are as follow s: 
• ANZE CC and ARMANZ 200012 guidelines for  protection of freshwater aquatic ecosystems 
(typically 95% protection of species , which is relevant to slightly to modera tely disturbed 
ecosystems) ; 
• Australian Drinking Wat er Guid elines (ADWG) (NH&MRC 2011) ; 
• WA Depa rtmen t of Health guidelines for non -pota ble groundwater use (NPGU) (DoH 2014) ; 
• ANZECC and ARM CANZ 2000 guidelines12 for irrigation water use, both short term (les s than 
20 years) and long ter m (up to 100 years) ; and 
• ANZE CC and ARMCANZ 2000 guidelines12 for livestock drinking water.  Guidelines f or beef 
cattle drinking water are used for comparison for Swan Coastal Plain assessments.  
 
For the purpose of this report,  the term “ constituent of potential concern ” (CoPC)  is use d to identify 
constituents  present i n by-products or naturally present in so il that have measured leachate 
concentrations exceeding one or more of these guideline values.  Whether or not this leads to 
unacceptable contamination  of the receiving envi ronment  is very much site specific, and the refore 
needs to consider the EQO’s for t hat site.  
In general, the most appropriate EQ O’s are likely to be as follows:  
• Rural areas used for low level grazing, crop ping or horticulture; long te rm irrigation 
guidelin es (ANZ ECC and ARMCANZ 2000).  This is dire ctly relevant to materials used as soil 
amendments;  
• Residential, commercial and industrial areas;  DoH non -potable groundwater guidelines.  
This is mainly relevan t to materials intended for u se as fill (e.g. groun dwater treatment 
residues); and  
• Human drink ing w ater catchment areas;  human drinki ng water quality guidelines and, in 
some cases, ANZECC and ARMCANZ 2000 freshwater ecosystem protection guidelines 
(Jandak ot and Gnangara mounds).   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

Serpen tine, Murray and Harvey river s; most of which have their h ead waters to the east within the 
Darling Plateau. The Serpentine, Murray an d Harvey Rivers discharge into the Peel -Harvey Estuary , 
which is the largest inland water body in south -western Australia (Brearley 2005 as cited in EP A 
2008 )13. 
The Swan Co astal P lain includes an extensive system of  wetl ands, covering over one quarter of the 
total land area14.  Wetlands range from intermittent through to seasonally or permanently 
waterlogged soils or inundat ed land.  Many of these are s ustained largely by re gional or localised 
groundwater tables.   Others within the Peel -Yalgorup area are r ecognised internationally as Ramsar 
wetlands.  
3.4.2 Groundwater  
Groundwater within the Swan Coastal Plain originates mainl y from direct rainfall rechar ge with a 
small compon ent bei ng derived from local runoff from th e Darling and Dandaragan Plateaus to the  
east15.  Several large groundwater aquifers within the Swan Coastal Plain discharge to the surrounds, 
which are hydraulic ally connected at a local sca le15.  These are the : 
• Superfi cial aquifer ; 
• Rockingham aquifer ; 
• Kings Park aquifer ; 
• Mirrabooka aquifer ; 
• Leederville aquifer ; and  
• Yarragadee aquifer.  
Water quality of receiving bodies on the Swan Coastal Plain, including wetlands  and the Peel Harvey 
and Swan -Canning estuaries, is  influe nced by surrounding land uses, notab ly ag riculture.  Some of 
these important  sites (including Ramsar wetlands) have suffered from periodic pollution events, algal 
blooms and fish kills resulting from  several factors, including a n excess of phosphorus  from r ural and 
urban land use practices en tering from the catchments.  
The Superfic ial aquifer is considered the most significant aquifer with respect to impacts from 
agricultural land uses, including turf  farming.  Typical groundwate r quality beneath the Bassend ean 
sands is characterised by modera tely acidic to slightly alkaline pH valu es, low salinity and often 
elevated concentrations of DOC.  Although chloride is usually the dominant anion, elevated sulf ate 
concentrations are freque ntly observed and are attribu ted to oxidation of acid sulfate soi l (ASS) 
materials exposed in the subsoil  profiles by lowering of the water  table.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
32 3.4.3 Soil Types  
The Swan Coastal Plain consists of a series of distinct landfor ms16, aligned roughly paralle l with the 
coast  (Figu re 2).  These relict dunal systems have for med a s a series of shoreline deposits.   Tamala 
Limestone underlies the undulating Quindalup and Spearwood dune systems running along the 
coast, adjoined in the ea st by the undulating aeolian sand plain of the Bass endean Dune System and 
the predominantly al luvial Pinjarra Plain15. 
The Bassendean sands are the dominant soil type currently utilised by turf farmers, the main reasons 
being their free draining properties  and relatively cheap land pr ices compared to other , more fertile 
soil types. Bassendean sands  are characterised by an extended geolog ical history of weathering, 
which has resulted in almost complete leaching of iron, aluminium, calcium, major nutrients an d 
metals. In their native con ditions, they are char acteris ed by low pH, very low salinity, ver y low 
nutrient retention properties and a tendency to become hydrophobic (non -wetting).  Amendment of 
Bassendean sands  with organic and inorganic materials  is wel l suited to ameliorating most  of these 
characterist ics, wh ich are considered detrimental to gr owth of introduced pasture and turf gras ses17. 
The more fertile Spearwood sands have a shorter history of weathering than the Bassendean sands 
and consequently re tain more calcium carbonate m inerals, which in turn  result s in circum -neutral to 
alkaline pH v alues.  Spearwood sands subsoil is well suited as clean fill for land development.  It is 
widely used for construction requirements such as production of concrete  and other cement 
products.  
The youngest dune syste m is th e Quindalup Dun e System , which has a history of <10,000 years of 
weathering.   The corresponding soils are characterised by high concentrations of calcium carbonate 
and are invariably alkaline.   
Sandy soils are preferred for forestry, recreational turf and horticulture  as they are free -drain ing a nd 
easy to manage.  The pH requirem ents for beneficial use  in terms of maximising soil biological 
activity and nutrient availability is typically  5.5 to 7.5  (measured in a 1:5 soil:water extract) .

The refere nce mat erials s upplied by ECN  for the inter-labor atory trial were described as followed;  
1. Reference material BA (bottom ash) – for LEAF 1313 test (in duplicate) only; a nd 
2. Reference material , MSWI -BA standard bottom ash – for LEAF 131 4 test (in duplicate) on ly. 
4.2 Soil Sa mple s Description  
The foll owing four soil types were  collected for laboratory analysis , LEAF testing  and used in the tall 
column laboratory leaching tri al: 
1. Bassendean sand  that has a history of fertiliser application in support of low intens ity 
agriculture .  The sample was sourced from a property that has been used for an earlier field 
trial in Ellenbrook  assessing three by-product  materials (including Al kaloam and IMG) as soil 
amendments.  
2. Spearwood sand , which is associated with a younger du ne syst em to th e Bassendean 
system, and i s charac terised by circum -neutral to slightly acidic surface soil overlying alkaline 
yellow sand subsoil.  These sands are wid ely used on the Swan Coastal Plain for urban 
development, horticultur e, construction  and supply of clean  fill. The test sample was  
sourced  for com mercially supplied material purchased for  construction uses by Curtin 
University . 
3. Bassendean sand from the low -lying Joel series , characterised by lower elevation and 
therefore increased risk of seas onal in undation  than the other Bassendean  sand sa mple 
described above .  The test sample was sourced from a location that has a history of low 
intensity grazing . 
4. Duplex  sandy surface soil  overlying the clay loam soils of the Pinjarra Plain system.  The test  
sample  was sourced from a location  (Fair bridge F arm) that has been used for low intensity 
agriculture.  
 
Samples of soil (surface soil and shallow subsoil) from the fi eld trial sites for the groundwater 
treatment plants as Wanneroo and Jandakot were also c haracte rised , but not tested by the LEAF 
methods. The dominant soil type at both sites is described as Bassendean sand.  Both sites were 
highly disturbed, but not cont aminated, by operational activities and the soils used for the field trials 
are expected to be m ore typi cal of Bassendean sand sub soils rather than natural profiles.  
 
Locations of the samples are shown in  Figure 3.  These soil types account for approximate ly 80% of 
the soils of the Swan Coastal Plain.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

Bassendean Joel series and  duplex soil collection location , (ii) 2b represent s Ellenbrook  trial site where 
Bassendean sand was collected.  
4.3 Sample Preparation  
All samples tested were  dried at 40oC in a fan forced oven  and m ixed to produce a homogenous 
sample. A moisture determination at 105oC was done on all dried samples to calculate dry weight s 
for samples to be used in the  LEAF tests.  
The reference materials from the Netherlands (BA Ref erentine  Materialen, and MSWI -BA S tandard 
bottom ash) were distinctly  non-homogenous with distinctly different particles , even after thorough 
mixing. A sub samp le of each dried material was sieved to determine particle size. For LEAF test 
1313, 85% of the sample h ad to pass through either a 0.3 mm, 2 mm, or 5  mm sieve.  For LEAF test  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
37 1314, 85% had to pass through a 2.38 mm sieve.  All the soil samples complied wi th the required 
sieve sizes, a larger mass being taken for testing for the coarser sizes.   
The LAB sampl e provided  could not pass through the 5 mm sieve. It consisted of large fibrous lumps  
present in the original material that did not mill well i.e . size reduction by milling was partially 
successful , but the sample became matted and resisted further  size re duction.  Eventually 85% 
passed through a 16  mm sieve, much larger than specified for the methods but the smallest practical 
size that could be obtained . The air-dried biosolid cake had 85% pass through the 5  mm sieve.  
4.4 Sample Characteri sation  
The labo ratory test work performed  for “sample characterisation” on the seven by -product samples 
included the following:  
• Total moisture (105 °C);  
• TOC; and  
• Total  elemental concentration by X-ray fluorescence ( XRF) and 4 -acid digestion by  
inductively coupled  plasma atomic emission spectromet ry (ICP/AES) for: Ag, Al, As, B, Ba, Be, 
Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg,  K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb,  S, Sb, Se,  Sn, Ti, Th, Tl,  U, V,  Zn. Also 
analysed for total Cl and F.  
Characterisation of the four soil types inclu ded the  followi ng; 
• pH in water and 0.01 M  CaCl2 (1:5, sample  : solution ratio);  
• Particle size distribution (it includes clay, silt and sand fractions);  
• Organic carbon;  
• Inorganic (c arbonate ) carbon concentration;  
• Oxalate -extractable iron and aluminium;  
• Phos phorus retentio n index (PRI);  
• Exchangeabl e cations and cation exchange capacity (CEC);  
• Total and bio -available nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and sulphur);   
• Total moisture (105 °C); and  
• Total elemental concentration by XRF and 4 -acid digestion by ICP/ AES for:  Ag, Al, As, B, Ba, 
Be, Ca , Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg,  K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, S, Sb, Se, Si,  Sn, Ti, Th, Tl,  U, V,  Zn, 
Cl, F. 
4.5 Leachate Solution Analyses  
All l eachate solutions derived from LEAF tests, large column study and field plo ts stud y were 
analysed for the following;  
• pH;  
• electrical conductivity  (EC);  
• Eh;  
• DOC;   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
38 • ICP/AES and/or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( ICP/MS ) analysis f or: Ag, Al, 
As, B, Ba, Be, Ca,  Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg,  K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb,  S, Sb, Se,  Sn, Ti, Th, 
Tl, U, V,  Zn; and  
• Anions by ion chromatography ( IC): Br, Cl, SO 4 and F.  
Note, regarding metal and metalloid concentrations being measured by neithe r ICP/MS and / or 
ICP/AES , ICP/MS is the more sensitive method and was utili sed where pos sible. The ICP/ MS has a 
lower tolerance f or dissolved salts than ICP/AES and solutions with high salt concentrations had to 
be diluted prior to reading.  This is respo nsible for any variable detection limits for the same analyte . 
Typical m ethod limits of r eportin g (LOR) for each analyte (in low T DS solutions) are presented in 
Table 2. The LOR is defined as 10 times  the standard deviation of the mean of the blank value .

41 4.6 Method 1313 : Liquid – Solid Parti tioning ( LSP) as a Function of  Extract pH  
The procedure for this method consisted of nine parallel extractions of a sol id mate rial (th e test 
sample) in  dilute aci d or base and reagent water.  Particle -size reduction of the material to be tested 
was not required , except for the LAB samp le (Section 4.3) .  A schedule of acid and base additions 
was formulated from a pre -test t itratio n curve indicating the re quired equi valents of acid or alkali 
per gram of sample to be added to the series of extraction vessels so as to yield a series of elua tes 
having nominal target pH values of 2.0, 4.0, 5.5, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.5, 12.0 and 13.0 ± 0.5. Also , a 
sample natural pH  extract wa s performed, i.e. no pH adjustment was performed on the sample.  In 
addition to the ten test extractions, three method blank s without solid samples were carried 
through the procedure in order to verify that analyt e inter ferences  were not introdu ced as a 
conseque nce of reagent impurities or equipment contamination. Thirteen bottles (i.e. nine test 
positions, natural sample pH an d three method blanks) for each sample were extracted using the 
extraction parameters hig hlighte d in gre en in  Table 3.  The nominal L/ S was 10:1, after considering 
reagent addition and moisture content of the solid sample. The tumbling apparatus was digita lly set 
at 30.0 rpm and kept in a room at a con stant t emperature of 22 ±  5 °C.  After equi libration, the  liquid 
and solid phases were separated by centrifugation (at 12,0 00 rpm  for 15 minutes ) and filtration.  
Analytical samples of the filtered eluate were  collected and preserved where appropriate for the 
chemical analyses describe d in Section 4.5.

4.7 Meth od 1314 : LSP as a Function of L/S Using an Up -Flow Percol ation Column  
This test method is intended as a means for obtaining a series of extracts (i.e. the eluates) of a 
granular s olid material (the test sample) which may be us ed to s how eluate concentratio ns and/or 
cum ulative releas e as a function of L/S.  This can then be related to a time scale when data is 
available on mean infiltration rate, density and height of application.  
 
Milli -Q water  (Vacuum  filter)  was the eluent i ntroduc ed into a column (following the US E PA 
method11) of moderately -packed test mater ial in an up -flow pumping mode , except biosolid and LAB 
where 0. 05 M CaCl 2 solution was used  due to the concern of deflocc ulation and dissolution of 
organic carbon , with  eluate  collection perfo rmed as a function of the cumulat ive L/S.  Note: in case of 
biosolids cake and LAB , both materials were diluted with acid washed sand before proceeding to the 
percolation L EAF 1314 test.  The use of 0.05M CaCl 2 as column eluent  soluti on for Biosolids cake and 
LAB was chosen fo llowin g prelim inary testing using varying Ca Cl2 concentrations (0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 
0.05 and 0.1 M), where only 0.05M CaCl 2 allowed flow through the packed column .  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
42 Up-flow pumping was used to minimi se air entrainm ent and  flow chan nelling. The eluent flow r ate 
was mainta ined between 0.5 -1.0 L/S per d ay to increase the likelihood of local equilibrium between 
the solid and liquid phases, due to residence times longer than  1 day. For the purposes of chemical 
speciation  modell ing, the e ntire eluent volume up to 10 mL/g dry sa mple (g -dry) was collected in six 
specific aliquots of varying volume. Hence, a scheduled set of eluate fraction collections was 
performed over 12 days to achieve end point L/S values of 0.2, 0.5, 1. 0, 2.0,  5.0 and 1 0. 
 
Eluate volumes were ch emically analy sed for the parameters describ ed in Section 4.5. 
4.8 Method 1315: Mass Transfer Rates in Monolithic and Compacted Granular 
Materials Using a Semi -dynami c Tank Leaching Procedure  
Metho d 1315 is a sem i-dynam ic tank le aching procedure used to d etermi ne the r ate of mass 
transport either f rom monolithic materials or compacted granular materials as function of time. In 
this method monolith samples are placed i n a tank where at least 98% of the surface area  is 
accessible to  the eluant which is total ly exchanged a t prescribed intervals with fr esh solution, 
finishing 64 days after commencement. The recovered eluate is then analysed for the desired 
analytes.  
As the  test materials in this study do not possess th e appro priate  physical characteristics, the  test 
method w as not used for this assessmen t. 
4.9 Method 1316 : LSP as a Function of L/S Using Parallel Batch Extraction  
This method is a batch extraction procedure w ith five parallel extractions designed to provi de 
information on  the liquid -solid partitio ning o f consti tuents as a function of L/S ra tio.  A mass of “as 
tested” solid material equivalent or greater than to a specified minimum dry mass is added to five 
extraction vessels.  Reagent water is added such t hat the  final L/S  ratio in the five extract ions is 0.5, 
1.0, 2.0, 5.0, and 10.0, respec tively.  Extracts are tumbled in an end -over -end fashion for a specified 
contact time (highlighted in green  in Table 3) that depends on the particle size of the sample.  The 
extract liqu id is separated from the s olid p hase by centrifugation, followed by fi ltration and 
preservation of analytical solutions.  The eluate samples were analysed for the parameters described 
in the S ection 4.5.

Ellenbrook  trial was conducte d over 1 ha (including small p lots 3  m x 3  m; total nine  plots) of land 
and initially monitored over four winter and spring seasons to assess the effect iveness of three soil 
amendments from wide ly diff erent sourc es; Alkaloam, IMG  and lim e amen ded biosolid clay (LaBC).  
These amendments were applied to leaching sandy soils of the Ellenbrook  catchment . Note: these 
amendments  were applied to the soil surface and were  not incorporated into the soil pr ofile . Three 
lysimeters were installed with in each of the smal l plots to collect leachate fr om soil over different 
rain events during winter and spring from 2012 to 2015 (Figure 4 and 5). The field study was 
contin ued for year 2016 -17 in the current MRIWA project , only the small plots (3 m x 3 m) w ith the 
soil amendm ent materials Alkaloam and IMG  was studied by collecting leachate samples from each 
lysimeter twice per annum after major rain events in winter and spri ng. The  leachate data produced 
from 2012 -15 from Ellenbrook  Project was mined and inc orpora ted in the cu rrent study.

45 4.10.1.2  Aroona Field Trials for Groundwater Treatment Residues  
Aroona established  small test plots at the Jandakot and Wann eroo gr oundwater treatment plants  to 
test t he leaching potenti al of constituents in the corr esponding groundwater treatment residues . 
As the intended use of these groundwater treatment residues is as clean fill, ea ch material was 
applied as a 300 mm cover followe d by compaction at natural moisture conten t.  Each mate rial was 
applied to triplicate  small plots, nominally 3 by 3 metres.  Drum lysimeter s (Figure 6) were installed 
at depth s approximately 300 mm and 500 m m below the natural soil surface level to collect  leachate 
from the underlying soil p rofile following si gnificant rainfall events over  two years.

Ellenbrook  Field Trial – Lysimeter leach ate (21  sample batches) and analysis - “In the field” leachate  
collections were performed in  July and November 2016 and in March and September 2017. Note 
that the March 2017 collection is additional in this project  due to the unusual heavy rainfall event o f 
Febru ary 2017.  
Aroona Field Trials – Lysimeter leachate ( eight sample batches) and analysi s - “In the field” leachate 
collections were performed in August and November 2016 and in September 2017.  
The Aroona field  lysimeters were decommissioned at the end  of thi s study. The Ellenbrook  field plots 
and lysimeters are still in place.  
4.10.1.3  Data Mining from past Bullsbrook Turf Field Trials Using IMG  
In 2008, CSIRO conducted a field trial investigating trace element  and radionuclide mobility in soil 
amended  with I MG at a turf farm in Bullsbrook,  WA18. Leachate samples  were collected from 
lysim eters placed in amended and non -amended (control) soils for a period of three and a half years.  
The IMG  was applied to the ex perimental plot at the rate of 150  dry t onnes per ha incorporated into 
the so il to a depth of approximat ely 10  to 15 cm using a rotary hoe with a roller mounted on the  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

siliceous sandy soils on t he Swa n Coastal Plain.  
4.10.2 Large Column Study 
The aim of this exerc ise was to perform lar ge column tests on field -like conditions that mimic 
climatic conditions such as an average rainfall season.  
The leaching columns  were constructed from acrylic  plast ic with two taps and lid. The column  
dimens ions were 1 m height and 15  cm diameter and the e xperimental configurations differ ed 
according to the by -product application ( Table 4, Figure s 7 and 8).

47 A to tal of 32 large leaching co lumns were run compris ing of seven materials by four  soil types, plus 
“control” columns for each soil type.  For each column, two leachate samples were c ollected per 
event for three leach ing ev ents at leaching times 0, 4 months an d 8 mo nths. In the case of the two 
biosolids mate rials (biosolids cake and LAB) , the leaching times were 0, 3 months and 6 months . 
The general principles of this study were develo ped during a pilot column test (Fi gure 9) conducted 
prior to commencing the 6 -8 mon ths large column leaching studies . The pilo t column test was used 
to confirm (i) pore volumes and drainage times for each layer and (ii) the absence of preferred flow 
pathwa ys. The principles of the large co lumns study are described below  and illustr ated in Figures 7 
and 8; 
• Each column was charged with 100 mm of amended soil (or 300 mm of fill material ) 
containing the equivalent of 50 tonnes per hectare of the amendment mater ial. 
• Underlying the amended soil l ayer w as 800 mm of gently compacted unamend ed soil, 
corresponding to e ach of the four soil t ypes described earlier.  In the case for “inert fill” 
application, the underlying soil layer was 600 mm.  
• Leachate samples were coll ected from sampling ports located at: 
o 100 mm below the base of the amended so il layer; and  
o Just above th e base of the unamende d soil laye r. 
• Leachate was collected following application of the equivalent of 1 50 mm rainfall as 
deionised water.   The correspon ding L/S ratio was approximately 2 .0. This is based on 12 kg 
soil in the colu mn (the weights of by -produ ct layer, soil and lea ching fluid were recorded for 
all columns) leached with approximately  6 L of water . 
Note: c olumn characteristics such as water hol ding capacity and drainage times w ere 
determined during the pilot column stud y (Figure 9) using a rhodam ine solution as a visu al 
tracer.  
• After the initial leaching event, excess leachate was removed via the lower drainage tap and 
the columns stored at room  temperature for three mont hs. 
• The column s were leached with a second 1 50 mm rainfall equi valent event a fter three 
months (cum ulative L/ S ratio approximately 4.0).  
• A third and final leaching event was conducted after a further three months  (cumulative L/s 
ratio approximately 6.0) . 
• “Control ” colum ns containing each of the four selec ted so il types were also se t up and 
sampled in pa rallel to the amended soil columns.  
• Each leachate sample was tested immediately for pH, EC, temperature, and redox potential 
(repo rted as Eh, milliVolts ). 
• Each leac hate wa s analysed in the laboratory for the  same parameters as the LEAF test 
leachates , Section 4.5.  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

49 4.10.2 .1   Large Column Study Pro cedure  
The det ailed large column leaching procedur e is described below.  
1. Glass  wool was added at the  bottom of the column.  
2. Then 12  to 13  kg of dry soil was added.  
3. Approximately 2.0 L deionised (D I) water was poured to saturate the  soil. 
4. Glass wool was place d on th e top o f soil layer to separate the soil fr om the amended soil 
layer a nd for the collection of clear extract at upper outlet from the amended soil – natural 
soil interface using a syringe.  
5. 2 kg of amended soil was placed o n the top of soil.  
6. To wet t he 2 kg  of ame ndment material, 0.5 L deionised wat er was applied. Leave overn ight.  
7. The following da y, approximately 2.7 L deionised water  was applied in the column, which is 
equivalent to approximately 150 mm of rainfall.  
8. Approx imately 200 mL of 1st leachate samp le was taken at the upper outlet. (Time dif ferenc e 
was 15 min).  
9. 2nd leachate was collected a t the bottom of the column, which corresponded to interstitial 
water applied to the sand prior to leaching the column with simula ted rainfall.  
10. Lastly 3rd leachate sample was collected after 150 mm of equiva lent r ainfall water 
applica tion. (Start time of f low 24 min).  
Note: During standing, the columns were capped tightly to prevent any evaporative loss.  
Leachate s ampling stages /eve nts: 
For each column, three leachat e sampl es were collected per event for thre e leaching events at 
leachi ng times 0, 4 months a nd 8 months. In the case of the two biosolids materials, the leaching 
times were 0, 3 months and 6 months.  
1. Leach Number (event) 1  -  First leachate sampling was conducte d at the start of the column 
study ( at 0 leaching time ). During  this stage, three lea chate collections were  performed as 
explained above in the procedure.  
2. Leach Number (event) 2  -  After 3 months, a 2nd leaching e vent was conducted at 150 mm of 
equivalent  rainfall. Soils were  at the field c apacity during three /four  months ’ time interval. 
During this event, firstly 500 mL of water was applied to saturate the amendment material 
and next day 150 mm of equivalent rainf all was performed as explained in t he proc edure. 
Three leachate collections were performed as explained a bove in the procedure.  
3. Leach Number (event) 3  -  The 3rd leaching event was conducted after 6 /8 months ’ time 
intervals , following the  same procedure a s in the step 2 above.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
50 4.11 Compar ison of LE AF Tools, Laboratory Column Leaching and  Field Stud ies Data  
In order to simplify c omparative assessment and interpretation of a large amount of experimental 
data relating to seven by -products, four soils, three a ssessment methods (LEAF tests, laboratory tall 
column leaching trial and three field trials) and 39 wate r quality parameters ( Table 2), a visual “risk 
screening profile” tool was developed  for the purposes of this pro ject (Section 2) . 
The tool, as presente d for the four soils used in this study (Tables 6 and 7), ranks constituents of 
potential concern  (CoP Cs) based on threshold  criteria  (Table 6 ) shown as; (i) below the lower 
threshold values (green) and (ii) above the lower threshold values with relative e xceedances in the 
increasing order yellow<orange<red.  
The authors note that these by -products are not in tended for unrestricte d use on the Swan Coastal 
Plain, as is curre ntly the case for other soil products  including fertilisers, composts, clays and loams , 
agricultural lime and gypsum.   Should these by-product materials be promoted for restricted use , an 
individual assessment by each provider , based on site specific water quality guidelines  and intended 
use guidelines, will need to be prepared as part of the approvals application process . 
The intended use of this “risk screening profile” tool, is limited to: 
• Rank constituents of  each materia l in terms of their potential risk to water quality on the 
Swan Coastal Plain.  The highest ranked constituents were then selected for further 
assessment using the LeachXS modelling tool ; and  
• Demonstrate the predictive ca pacity, or otherwise , of the LEAF tools  for each combination of 
by-product and soil type against results from the tall column and field trial  experiment s.

51 5 RESULTS AND DISC USION  
5.1 LEAF Tests Method Validati on and Quality Assurance  
Samples were dried  to consta nt weight wi th difference between weighing within the larger of 0.02 g 
or 0.2%.  Accurate dry weight determinations were critical to correct ex ecution of the LEA F tests . 
The LEAF tests were performed in t riplicate on each by -product and soil sampl e. 
The only well chara cterised materials available for LEAF method comparison and validation are 
reference materials developed by ECN.  Unfortunately, o nly a limited amou nt of s uch material was 
available and as a result only duplicate (as opposed to the pr eferre d triplicate) an alyses were 
performed. This has no significant impact on the method comparison and validation .  
The lack of readily available cert ified reference ma terial or additional reference or control s ample s 
represents a limitation in th e appli cation of LEAF tests in Western Australia that needs to be 
addressed.  
All the test eluents were analysed at ChemCentre Laboratory according to standard analytical 
method s and QA /QC protocols for each analyte  of in teres t.  
     5.1.1 Method 1313  
Method Summary  
Samples of the  test material  (ECN-Ref material , BA bottom ash ) were reacted with aliquots of acid 
and base at a liquid to solid ratio of 10:1 to ac hieve a desired pH  betwee n pH 2 and pH 13. The liquid 
fractio n was separated from the solid by centrifug ing and filtrati on. Th e filtrate was then split into 
two portions for analysis.  
Some of the leaching pH targets could not be achieved due to the lack o f test material av ailab ility. 
Method Blank Analysis  
Blank ext ractions (i.e. extractions without solid ma terial) were carried o ut to assess potential 
source s of contamination . Three blanks were run for each sample: Milli -Q water, acid blank in Milli -Q 
water  equal to maximum acid ad dition and alkaline blank in Milli -Q wate r equal to maximum 
addition of KOH . No comparisons between f iltered a nd non -filtered blanks were performed.  
 
Repeatability and Reproducibility  
The intra -laboratory repeatability (repeatabili ty of ChemCentre d etermin ations) was assessed by 
performing i ndepe ndent duplicate analysis. The results are presented in Appen dices A 1 and A1.1 
with illustrative examples shown in Figure  10.  Overall , there was excellent agreement between the 
duplicate ana lysis indicating t hat the  ChemCentre methods were internally consistent. 
Inter -laboratory reproducibilit y (comparison between ChemCe ntre and ECN) was assessed by 
comparing the ChemCentre determinations to previous ECN determinations. The results are 
presen ted in Appendices A1.2 an d  A3  with illustrative examples sh own i n Figures 11 and 12.  Figure 
11 shows the typically close ag reem ent between ChemCentre and ECN.  Figure 12 shows the   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
52 ChemCentre data falling within the 95 % confidence intervals determined from the prior ECN  
analys is. 
In general, there was a good agr eemen t between the ChemCentre and ECN data,  a view confir med 
by LEAF expert Dr Hans  van der Sloot in his review of the work  (unpublished report to Alcoa, 201 8).

5.1.2 Method  1314  
Method summ ary 
Met hod 1314 is an up -flow column procedur e used to evaluate the  release of c onstituents  from 
solid materials as a function of cumulative liquid to solid ratio (L/S) from 0.5 to 10  mL eluent/g o f dry 
material. Re lative to the field conditions, L/S can b e a use ful surrogate measure for time when 
infiltration rates are c onsidered. In  the contex t of the column test, L/S is defined as the volume of 
liquid passing through the column relative to dry eq uivalent mass of t est mat erial in the column bed 
and is exp ressed in units of mL/g -dry. The test materia l (ECN-Ref material (M SWI bottom as h) was 
treated (section 4.7 ) and the collected leachate was filtered and split into two portions for analysis 
of mult iple analytes.  
Met hod Blank Analysis  
For Method 1314, the r equired  method blanks were simply a sample of  the leaching solution s used 
in the column test. Method blan ks were chemically analysed along with the test extractions and the 
results were evaluated t o identify potenti al sour ces of contamination (e.g.  contact  surfac es, 
contaminated reagents) that might bias the results of th e test extraction.  
Repeatability and Reproducibility  
The intra -laboratory repeatability (repeatability of ChemCentre determination s) was assessed by  
perfor ming independent duplicate analysi s.  The results are presented in Appendices A 2 and A2.1 
with illust rative examples shown in F igure 13.   Overall there was excellent agreement between the 
duplicate analysis indicating that the Chem Centre methods wer e inter nally consistent.  
Inter -laboratory  reprod ucibility (comparison between ChemCent re and ECN) was assess ed by 
comparing the ChemCe ntre determinations to previous ECN determinations.  The results are 
presented in Appendices A2.2 and  A 4  with illustrati ve exam ples shown in Figures 14 and 15.  Figure 
14 shows the typically close agreement  between ChemCentre an d ECN.  Figure 15 shows th e  
ChemCentre data falling within confidence intervals determined from the prior ECN analysis.  
Overall there was a good ag reement  between the ChemCentre and ECN da ta, a v iew confirmed by 
Professor van der Slo ot in his assessment o f the work  (unpublished report to Alcoa, 201 8).

59 5.1.3 Summary  –  LEAF T ests Me thod Validation and Quality Ass uranc e  
The inter -laboratory comparison trial wi th ECN showed good agr eement between the  ChemCentre 
and ECN for both LEAF 1313 and LEAF 1314.    
With robust method validation and qua lity assurance perf ormance ChemCentre  is now  accredited by 
the National Ass ociat ion o f Testing Authorities ( NATA ) for the L EAF tests 1313, 1314, 1315 and 1316 .  
As a result, Western Australian industry, researchers and gover nment regulatory agencies  now ha ve 
access to accred ited LEAF testing.  
There is no certified reference mater ial (CRM)  or other reference or control  for LEAF  testing  in 
Australia . Suitable certified reference materials  (preferably applica ble to local conditions) should be 
developed , noting  that CRM developme nt is complex and time co nsuming .

60 5.2 Swan Coastal P lain Soils  
5.2.1 Soil Characterisation   
The four  soil samples describe d in Section 4.2  were analysed for key soil characteristics (Section 4.4).   
Results for these tests are presen ted in Table 5. 
Resu lts relevant to th e poten tial of these soils to interact  with  soluble constituents of soil 
amendment mat erials are summarised below:  
• All soils were non -saline, as indicated by very low values for EC (1 to 8 mS/m) and 
chloride concentrat ions (<0. 01%).  
• Soil pH values were var iable, ranging from 4.3 (as pH in 0.01  M Ca Cl2) for the 
Bassendean sand from Ellenbroo k to 8.2 for Spearwood  sand.  The Spearwood sand 
was the only one to contain inorganic carbonate, with a concentration of 0.33% 
inorganic car bon equival ent to a calcium c arbonat e content of approximately 3%.  
• Both Basse ndean sands (Ellenbrook and Joel) were  similar in texture, c haracterised by 
very low silt and clay contents. The soils differed by the Joel soil having higher nutrient 
contents as  a conseque nce of history of fertili ser and possibly lime use.  
• The Fairb ridge  duplex soil contained significantly m ore organic carbon (1. 77%) than 
the others. The organic carbon content of Spearwood sand (0.18%) is considered very 
low.  
• The Fairbri dge duple x soil cont ained much more to tal (an d extractable) phosphorus 
than the o ther soils as a consequence of a long histo ry of fertiliser use.  
• Both Bassendean sands (Ellenbrook and Joel) had effectively zero capacity to retain 
anionic nutrients (and con taminants ) by surfac e adsorption, as i ndicate d very low 
values for Phosphoru s Ret entio n Index (PRI) (0.1 and 0.0 mL/g for th e Ellenbrook and 
Joel soils, respectively).  Spearwood sand had a moderate adsorption capacity, as 
indicated by a PRI of 5.2 mL/g.  
• The Fairbr idge duplex  soil had substant ial Cat ion Exchange Capacity (CEC) (6 cmol  
(+)/k g).  The other soils had (low) CEC of 3 cmol (+)/kg provided  by both clay minerals 
(Spearwood sand) and organic matter (Bassendean sands).  
• Calcium was the dominant exchan geable ca tion in all  samples, with ver y low 
exchangeable sodium (very low so dicit y). 
• The Fairbridge duplex soil, and to a le sser degree the Joel B assendean sand, had 
accumulated various micronutrients and heavy metals, mainly by application of 
fertilisers.   Spearwo od sand was  effectively devoi d of th ese elements.  Of particular 
note: 
o Fairbr idge duplex soil contained slightly el evated concentrations of extractable 
cadmium, cobalt, copper and manganese;  
o Joel Bassendean sand contained slightly elevated concent rations o f 
extractab le copper, zinc an d boron ; and  
o None of the soils contain ed si gnifi cant concentrations of extractable 
molybdenum, nickel, arsen ic or selenium.

63 5.2.2  Soil Samples - LEAF 1313 Test Results   
In order for LEAF to be used  to predi ct leachate  concentrations in  situat ions where the product is 
inten ded f or us e as a soil amendment material or clea n fill substitute, it is necessary to use pH 
dependence data for each constituent of potential concern in the corresponding soil.  T his section 
presents  results from an a ssessme nt of pH dependence data (LEAF 1313 Metho d) for four 
common sandy soils, which represent the majority  of soil types encountered on the Swan Coastal 
Plain  (sections 3.3.3 and 4.2) .  Note that LEAF can be subseque ntly used  to predict  leachate 
concentr ations for soil -derived constituents o f pot entia l concern in specific soils with sligh tly 
different characte ristic soil properties (such as pH, clay content and soil organic matter) to those 
assessed in this section.  Note also  that if LE AF methodology is to be u sed on soils with 
substantially  different  chemical properties (such as Darling Range loams and gravel s, tropical 
Pindan soils and sodic clays of the wheatbelt region), then samples of these soil types will also 
require a nalysis usi ng LEAF 1313 metho dology . 
Results for analysis of the fo ur so il sa mples are presented as graphs in Appen dix A5 -7. 
Characterist ics of the pH dependent leaching characteristics by analyte for these materials are 
summarised as follows:  
• Silver:  All  leachates recorded silver co ncentra tions below the method reportin g lim it. 
• Aluminium:  Aluminium in all samples in dicated amphoteric cha racteristics. However, there was 
also wide variation with the pH range associated within typical soil environm ents ( pH 4.5 to 9), 
with concentration s decre asing in the order Fairbridge d uplex  > Ba ssendean Joel > Bassendean 
Ellenbrook > Spearwood. Soil orga nic carbon appears to be important in aluminium release 
from these soils.  Concentrations between 0.1 and 1 mg /L were r ecorded in leachates of 
Fairb ridge d uplex and both Bassendean soil types  with  the pH range of 6 to 8.  
• Arsenic conce ntrations were very lo w for all soil types across the pH range associated within 
typical soil environments ( pH 4.5 to 9).  Slightly elevated concentrati ons were present i n highl y 
alkaline leachates of Spearwo od sa nd (m aximum 0.025 mg/L at pH 13).  
• Boron con centrations were low ( approximately 0.1 mg/L) for all soil types across the pH range 
associated within typical soil environments ( pH 4.5 to 9 ).   
• Barium  concentration max ima wer e recorded at low pH (pH  2) and  decr eased  in order 
Fairbridge duplex > Bassende an Ellenbrook ~ Spearw ood sand > Bassendean Joel. Leachate 
concentrations within the pH range associated within typical soil environ ments ( pH 4.5 to 9) 
were much lower (< 0.01 mg /L), indicating the leaching of  barium fr om these soils presents very 
low envir onmental risk.  
• Berylli um: measurable concentrations were only recorded in acidic (pH 2 -4) leachates of 
Spearwood sand.  
• Calcium conce ntrations  were extre mely variable, ran ging fr om 0.1 to 1,000 mg/L.  For each  soil 
samp le, maximum concentrations were record ed at the lowest pH (p H 2) and decreased from 
1,000 mg/L from the slightly calcareous Spearwood sand to 10 mg/L to the highly leache d 
Bassend ean sand fr om Ellenbrook.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
64 • Cadmium: t he Fairbridge duplex soil conta ining  appr eciable concentrations of soluble cadm ium 
(0.01 to 0.001 mg/ L), but only at very low (pH 2) and very high pH (pH >12). The presence of 
cadmium may be associated with a lo ng histor y of superp hosphate use at th is site . 
• Chromium:  maximum chromium c oncen trati ons were variable and pH dependent.  T he highest 
soluble con centration was approximately 0.03 mg/L in Spearwood sand at low pH (pH 2).  
Solubility maxima of approximately  0.01 mg/ L were reco rded at high pH ( pH 13) f or the 
Fairbridge duplex and Ba ssend ean E llenbrook samples. The other Bassendea n (Joel) sand 
recorded  lower concentrations at all pH values, with a maximum of approximately 0.001 mg/L 
at pH 2.  
• Copper concentrati ons were extremely v ariable and genera lly ind icated amphoteric behaviour.  
Maximu m con centrations were recorded at pH 13 for  all soils, with value s decreasing from 
approximately 0.1 mg/L for the Fairbridge duplex and Bassendean Joel soils to 0.01 mg/L for 
Spearwood  sand. As w ith aluminium, chr omium , iron and other metals, the rela tive 
conce ntrations and pH -dependent solubility of copper  are controll ed by interaction with 
dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC). It is important to  note 
that not all t he DOC and POC are  reacti ve towards metals, hence a frac tiona tion is needed in 
the modelling to address the respective reactiv e parts; dissolved humic acid (DHA) and solid 
humic acid (SHA) . 
• Iron concentrations were also variable and dep endent on  pH and soi l type, with conce ntratio ns 
ranging from 0.01 to approxi matel y 10 mg/L. While indicating amphoteric beha viour, the 
maximum con centration for each soil sample was recorded in the pH 13 leachate.  
Concentrations decreased from approximate ly 10 mg/ L for the F airbridge duplex s oil, to  
approximately 5 mg/L for Spear wood and s and and 1 mg/L for both Bassendean san d samples.  
• Potassium c oncentrations with the range of 4 to 8 pH units were between 1 and 10 mg/L and 
generally reflected the fertili ser histo ry at each location.  A signi ficantl y higher concentration 
(approxi matel y 100  mg/L) was recorded for Spearwood sand  at pH 2, which may be  a 
consequence of partial dissolution of potassium feldspar minerals present in this soil type.  
• Magnesium conc entration  in the pH dependence curves were re corded maximum at pH 2.  
Much h igher  conc entrations (approximately 600 mg/L) we re dissolved by acid f rom Spearwood 
sand compared with the other naturally acidic soil samples (<10 mg/L).  
• Manganese concentrations were high ly variable , ranging from app roximat ely 0.0001 to 1 mg/L.  
At acidi c pH value s, the order of manganese solubility d ecreased in the order Fairbridge duplex> 
Spearwood > both Bassendean sands, while the order under strongly alkaline conditions was 
Fairbridge  duplex > b oth Bassendean san ds > Sp earwood sand.  
• Molybdenum concen trati ons w ere generally very low for all samples , with the only 
concen trations slightly above the reporting limit (0.001 mg/L) recorded in slightly alkaline 
leachates of the Fairbr idge dupl ex sample.  As molybdenum is an esse ntial micronutrient, the 
presen ce of  soluble molybdenum in the Fairbridge sampl e may result from fert iliser residues.  
• Sodium concentrations were generally low (1 to 10 mg/L) and did not vary significantly with p H.  
The o bserved con centrations are co nsidere d typical of leachates from non -saline so il types.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
65 • Nickel:  except for the low pH leachates, nickel w as only recorded at very low concentrations 
(approximately 0.03 mg/L) in leachates of Fairbridge duplex and Sp earwood s and samples . 
• Phosphorus:  lea chates of all samples except Spearwood  sand  cont ained soluble phosphorus at 
levels lik ely to contribute to e utrophication of surface waterbodies on the Swan Coastal Plain.  
The highest concentrations (up to 10 mg/L) we re from a lkaline lea chates of the Fair bridge 
duplex sample. Concentrations o f app roxim ately 1 mg/L were recorded in acidic ( pH 2 to 6) and 
highly alkaline (pH 13) leachates of the Bassendean Joel sample.  Lower concentrations were 
recorded for the Bassende an Ellenb rook sample , reflecting lower  fertil iser usage at that 
location.  C oncen trati ons in leachates of Spearwood sand wer e very low except for a value of 1 
mg/L in the pH 13 leachate.  
• Lead concentrations were both pH and soil type dependent. All samples  indicate d amphoteri c 
behaviour. The h ighest concentrations of approximately  0.05  mg/L  were recorded in acid 
leachates of Sp earwood sand and both acid and alkaline leachates of the Fairbridge duplex 
sample. Much lower values were recorded at the natural pH  of each sample, wit h the lowest 
conce ntratio n of 0.0001 mg/L recorded for S pearw ood s and. The highest natural pH lead 
conce ntration was recorded for the Fairbridge duplex sample.   
• Sulfur (and sulfate) concentrations generally increased with increasing pH , with va lues genera lly 
between 0.1 an d 1 mg/ L within the pH range associate d wit hin t ypical soil environments ( pH 4.5 
to 9) . Concentrations decre ased in the order Fairbridge duplex ~ Bassendean Joel > Bassendean 
Ellenbrook > Spearwood sand, which reflects  fertilis er history and soil fertility . 
• Tin, antimony, thallium and uranium conce ntrat ions were generally low to extremely l ow and 
unlikely to pre sent significant risks to the environment. Slightly elevated concentrations of tin 
(0.01 to0.05 mg/L) were rec orded in strongly al kaline leachates o f Spear wood sand and 
Fairbridge duplex  samp les.  Uranium concentrations between 0.001 and 0.01 mg/L were 
recorded in alkaline (pH >8) leachates of Fairbridge duplex soil and may be derived from 
phosphate fertiliser res idues.  
• Vanadium conc entrations were hi ghly va riable and strongly dependent o n bot h lea chate pH and 
soil type. Slightly eleva ted concentrations of 0.01 to 0.1 mg/L were recorded for the acidic and 
alkaline leachates of Fairbridge duplex and Spearwood sand s amples, w hile concen trations in 
circum -neutra l leachates of all samples, but  particula rly Spearwood sand and Bassendean an 
Ellenbrook samples were  extremely low (less than 0.001 mg/L).  
• Zinc: the maximum concentration of zinc was approximately 0.2 mg/L in p H 2 leach ates of 
Fairbridge duplex and  both B assendean sand samples. Zinc ex hibit ed am photeric behaviour, 
although concentra tions in the alkaline leachates (pH >10) were an order of magnitude lower 
the that of the acidic (pH 2) leachate of these samples. M uch lower  concentrat ions were 
recorded  in Spe arwood sand leachates, with con centr ation s typically less than 0.01 mg/L. The 
presence of leachable z inc in these soils appears to be related to both fertiliser history and soil 
organic carbon contents.  
• Dissolve d organic  carbon:  c oncentrations of D OC were  highly variable as related to soil type 
and leachate pH.  Solution minima were  associated with sligh tly acid pH Values ( pH 4 to 6), 
while maxima were recorded in pH 13 leachates.  The DOC values decreased in th e order  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
66 Fairbridge d uplex (approximate ly 200 mg/L) > Bassendean Ellenbrook >  Bass endea n Joel > 
Spearwood sand (approximately  50 mg/L).  
The pH depe ndent leaching data (LEAF 1313) for the Swan Coastal Plain soils are presented in Figure 
16 for aluminium, cop per, pho sphorus and zinc. The data  indicate s that these soil samples have 
potenti al to  leach aluminium and phosphorus at notable levels.  (Section 3.3 and Table 1) . Copper  
and zinc (Figure 1 6) may  also leach at nota ble levels  under acidic (pH <5) condition s. Fairbridge 
duplex soil contains relatively higher concentrations of severa l constitu ents, probably as a 
consequence of its  long fertili ser usage  history. However, the solubility of these elements is typically 
low as a consequence of circum -neutral to slightly acid pH condit ions, and possibil ity sta ble 
interactions with soil orga nic m atter . 
These findings suggest that for some  constituents  the natu ral soils (as opposed to the by -products) 
may significantly contribute to overall leaching characteristics of the by -prod uct/soil mixture.

67 5.2.3 LeachXS Predictive Modelling - Chemical Speciation Fingerprint  
LeachXS includes a flexible set of  laborato ry test and field simulat ion model scenarios that can be  
used  for parameter estimation (laboratory test simulations) and evalu ating leaching under a variety 
of field conditions (prediction scenarios). In general, the user can adjust the material c haracteri stics, 
initial con ditions  and boundary conditions for wi thin each scenario.  
The predicted chemical speci ation fingerp rints of soils and by -product amendment materials, and 
percolation parameters may be used to evaluate the results of percolation c olumn tes ts using a 
concept ual mod el comprising mobile and immobi le zo nes. The conceptual model (Figure 17) consi sts 
of two zo nes segme nted along the flow path, with one zone containing a mobile fluid phase in local 
equilibrium with the solid phase and the  second z one containing an immobil e fluid phase in local 
equilibr ium w ith t he solid phase. Within each column seg ment, each of  the mobi le and immobile 
zones are well mixed (i.e., uniform distribution of constituents within each of the solid phase and 
liqui d phase o rthogonal to the f low dir ection), and the mobile and imm obile  zone s exchange 
dissolved constituents base d on mass tra nsfer coe fficients that can be considered an effective 
diffusion distance. This model is insensitive to percolation flow rate beca use homog eneity within the 
immobil e zone is assumed. This model c an be  used  for a first -order approximation of th e effects of 
preferent ial flow in a percolation system, as well as the impacts of changes in redo potential and 
influent solution chemistry on the leach ing of constituent s.

In order for LeachXS to  pred ict leaching characteristics of amended soi ls, the conce pt of a “ virtual 
material” was developed. For the purpose of this project, a “virtual material” may be considered as a 
representat ion of a blend of a by-prod uct with a sandy soil in a ratio equiv alent  to typical field  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
68 application rates. Typic ally, this is 5% by mas s which is approximately equivalent to 30 to 50 tonnes 
of dry material per hectare applied to soil and mixed by incorpora ting to a  depth of 100 mm.  
LeachXS  has a capability for generatin g che mical  speciation fingerprints of a virtua l material 
(amended soil  layer) by combining the chemical speciation fingerprints of each component at the 
assigned mixing ratio. This is demonstrated  under sections  5.3, 5 .4.1 an d 5.5.1.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
69 5.2.4  LeachX S Materi al Charact erisation and Chemical Speciation Fing erprints of 
Bassendean  Ellenbrook Soils  
In order to produce a chemical speciation fingerprint for a by -product, soil or “virtual material”, 
LeachXS requ ires input of the followi ng data and parameters : 
• LEAF Me thod 1313 leachate composition (including DOC).  
• LEAF Method 1314 leach ate composition.  
• “Clay” content  of the solid material .  Clay content in soil materials is routinely 
analysed using a hydrometer me thod to measure th e densi ty of soil suspensions.   
Howeve r, the not ion of “clay” content of some industry  by-products and, in p articular, 
organic materials, is not applicable.  In such cases, ChemCentre chose  to use nominal 
values (“best guess estimates ”) and adjust the val ues to p rovide the best p redict ed 
vers us me asured leachate concentrations for key analy tes.  It is important to note that 
LeachXS does not differentiate between two distinct classes of clay minerals, being 
Low Activity Clays (clay -sized mi nerals such as kao linite and quartz , which  have lo w 
permanen t charge density) and reactive clays (such a s smectite, illite and  zeolite 
minerals, which have high  permanent charge density) . 
• Hydrous ferric oxides or “HFO”  in the solid material .  This para mete r refers to 
amorph ous hyd rous oxide minera ls conta ining  iron, aluminium and manganese.  
These minerals a re able to develop sub stantial (but variable) surface charge (positive 
charge at low pH and negative charge at high pH), which is responsible for su rface 
adsorption of se veral m etals and metallo ids, not ably those  forming stable oxy -anions 
(such as phosphat e, molybdate, arsenate /arsenite, selenate/selenite and vanadate). 
ChemCentre has a validated method for measuring hydrous aluminium and iron 
oxides in WA soil using acidi c (pH 3 ) ammonium oxalat e as a s elect ive e xtractant.  The 
method, however, is not suit ed to alkaline soils, alkaline by -products or organic 
materials, in which case nominal values are used as discussed in the preceding dot -
point.  Alt erna tive methods, such  as tha t using a citrate -dithion ite e xtrac tant, may be 
used.  However, previous work b y ChemCentre has demon strated this method to be 
inferior to the oxalate method for predicting anion adsorption characteristics of WA 
soils. In addit ion to high -surface ar ea hydr ous oxide mineral s, the c itrat e-dithionite 
method partially dissolves crystalli ne oxide minerals  (such as gibbsite, hematite and 
goethite), which have much less anion adsorption capacity to the anhydrous minerals.  
• Solid  Humic Acid or SHA  in the soli d mater ial.  Solid humic  acid re fers to th e high 
molecular fraction of humified soil o rganic matter that for ms stable ionic complexes 
with hydrated metal ions.  Previous work by ChemCentre has shown that SHA 
accounts for appro ximately 20%  of total organic carbon  (TOC)  in Swan Coa stal Pla in 
sandy soils.  As the laboratory method is tedious ( and therefore expensiv e), SHA was 
not measured on these soil samples, or on any waste materials.  A default value of 
22% of TOC was used as the initial nominal SHA value for all  materials, which  was the n 
able to be adjusted slightly (±20%) to provide the b est CFS curve fit for copper and 
chromium, for which their pH dependent solubility is mainly controlled by association 
with either dissolved  or particul ate organic matter . 
• Disso lved humic acid ( DHA) in each leach ate of the LEAF 1313 (pH dependence) test 
method.  This value is e xpressed as a fraction of DOC.  As this parameter is not 
routinely measured in commercial laboratories, a value of 20%  of DOC in e ach 
leachate was s elected  as a nominal val ue for t his p arame ter.  This value was derived 
from earlier st udies by Alcoa and its  relevance to soil and other by -product materials  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
70 has not been demonstrated.  As for HFO and SHA, values of DHA conten ts were 
adju sted to provide th e best curve fit for mea sured an d pre dicte d metal ( particularly 
Cu and Cr) concentrati ons. 
• pE.  pE is define d as the chemical potential of the electron and is an important 
parameter required for predictive chemical speciation modelling of  element that are 
sensiti ve to redox condi tions (a s mea sured  in the laboratory by Oxidation Reduction 
Potential (ORP) or Eh).  As such, pE is not an inherent characteristic of a material as it 
cannot be measured directly.  Therefore, only nomin al values we re able to be used  in 
LeachXS modelling. A dvice su pplie d to ChemCentre during the 2017 training workshop  
was to derive an init ial nominal value calculated  from the “rule of thumb” relationship 
that pH + pE ~ 14 in the laboratory environment.  A s with other  parameters requir ed 
for LeachXS modelling , this a pproa ch wa s adopted for pE, with values subsequently 
modified to provide the  best chemical speciation fingerprints  for redox sensitive 
elements such as manganese and iron.   
 
LeachXS was used to generate ch emical speciation fingerp rints for all fou r soil s ample s use d in the 
tall column experiments. However, d ata are only presented  for the Bassendean Ellenbrook Soil in 
Appendix A9  of this report, as this was sole soil material used in t he predictive leachate modelling  
for all by-prod ucts assessed . 
Preliminar y LeachXS mod elling for Bassendean (Ellenbrook) sand w as undertaken using LE AF test 
experiment data for the sample collected for this project, but with values for clay, HFO, SHA, DHA 
and pE used in an earli er study by Alcoa.   These  findings are present ed b elow to de mon strate the 
sensitivity of clay and HFO co ntents on LeachXS pred ictions.  Modelled values comprised:  
• Clay content; 1% and 10% ; 
• HFO; 3, 450 mg/kg ; and  
• SHA; 1,000 mg/kg . 
 
One aspect of LeachXS mode lling that became apparen t while modelling the fou r soi l sam ples was 
the ability to improve alig nment of  predicted and experim ent leachate concentration data by 
altering input values for parameters including pE ( as discussed for groundwater treatment resid ues), 
HFO, clay an d SHA contents. As an example, Figure  18 show s chemical speciation fingerprint  
predict ions for aluminium in Bassendean Ellenbrook soil using nom inal clay contents of 10,000 
mg/kg (1%) and 100,000 mg/kg (10%). Although LeachXS predicted a better description  of 
experimental results using 1 0% cl ay co ntent, adoption of this value is not  conside red appropriate as 
it does not reflect the properties of B assendean sand. The sample of Bassendean Ellenbrook sand 
used in the tall column experiment (a nd Method 1313) co ntained  1.0% clay (and 0.5% silt ), as  
pres ented in Table 5. 
Other key observat ions rel ating to the chemical speciation fingerprint for aluminium  in Bassendean 
Ellenbrook sand presented in Figure 18 are: 
• Predicted free aluminium concentrat ions of approximat ely 1 m g/L for leachates with pH  
values le ss than 5 (at L/S = 10), well above the ANZE CC 2000 guideline for protection of 
freshwater ecosystems 0.055 mg/L (Table 1).  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
71 • Substantial proportions of aluminium are associated with soil organic ma tter, both in solu ble 
(DOC-bound) and soil matrix (POM -bound ). 
• As expected, the fraction of alum inium as sociated with clay min erals increases with the 
nominal cla y content adopted for Leac hXS modelling.  At the unrealistic value of 10% clay, 
more than 90% of aluminium is as sociate d with clay between 2.5 a nd 5 pH un its; and  
• Under circum -neutral to alk aline co nditions, which are no t present in natural Bassendean 
sand  profile s, LeachXS predicts formation of mixed calcium -aluminium oxide phases similar 
to those  present in cement  and co ncrete products.  
 
These p redic tions  are not consistent with findings fr om studi es on Bassendean sands  and other 
sandy soils from the sout hwest of WA17,21,22, which indicate that most of the low concentrations of 
aluminium are prese nt in association with so il organic matter or hydr ous i ron/a luminium oxide 
coatings of silica sa nd grain s.

The ch emica l speciation fingerprint charts for phosphor us are presented in Figure 19 at a clay

72 analytical data presented in Table  5 for this soil. Key prediction s pre sente d in these charts indicate 
the follo wing:  
• LeachXS predicts very lo w concentrations of soluble phosphor us (<0.0001 mg/L at L/S =10) 
between 2 and 7 pH units.  This prediction is not consistent with  Method 1313 exper imental  
data, tall column leacha te qu ality  (Section 5.2.4.1 ) and Ellenbrook fi eld tria l results ; and  
• LeachXS  predicts that most of the phosphoru s in Bassendean Ellenbrook sand is associated 
with the FeOxide -bound soil phase.   Note however  that the nominal value o f 3,450 mg/kg 
for HFO is much highe r than the experimental ly derived va lue of 1 00 mg/kg. T he 
correspo nding chart in Appendix A9 indicate much lower proportions of this fraction (and 
correspondingly higher values of “free” (leachabl e) phosphate).

73 5.2.5 Labor atory Data 
5.2. 5.1 Tall Column E xp eriment  
As discussed i n Section 4.10.2, a large column ex periment was set up  as follows:  
A control  was performed in the tall column ex periment by using soil at the top 10 cm layer.  
Leachates were collected on three occasions, as  summarised in Section 4. 10.2.1 (designated as Tim e 
1, 2 and  3). 
At each sampling eve nt, leachates were collected from:  
• Immedi ately below the soil layer;  
• Draining  the tap at the base of the column prior to flushing, i.e. sampling interstitial 
water from so il voids from the initial  setting up of the column  and subse quent 
leaching events; an d 
• Collecting leacha te from the base of th e column after the flushing event de scribed in 
Section 4.10.2.1.  
 
Results for analysis of the leachates are tabulated in Table A1 -1 of Appendix A11.   In ad dition, results 
for all a nalyt es ar e plotted as charts prese nted in Appendix 12 .  Each chart shows th e concentrations 
for the specific an alyte and soil type from the three leachate sampling points collected on three 
occasions (colo ured lines and mar kers), with the corresponding re sults  from  the “control” columns 
(i.e. no amended soil  and residue material cover layer) as black dashed lines ( no markers).  
Analytes where all concentrations from the flushed column samples were  below the “lower 
threshold” values listed in Table  6 have very lo w po tent ial for environmenta l impact.  All other 
analytes may warrant f urther investigation (Table 7), so me of these are discussed in Section 5.2.5.2.  
In many cases, it is observed that the lea chate co ncentrations from the flu shing of the column are  
contro lled mai nly by the soil material rather than the amendment material. Ex ceptions to this 
general observati on are discussed in greater detail in the following sections.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

75 5.2.5.2 Potential for mobilisation of specific constituent s from  soils 
Using Table 7 as a g uide, the potential for mobili sation o f specific constituent s from soils are 
summarised  below . 
In the ir “natural” state, seepage from the four soils selected for the study is predicted to contain 
concentrations of certain constit uents with potential  to imp act environmental receptor s in very 
close proximity to the surface soil.  Poten tial constituent s from  soil include:  
• Aluminium at concentrations exceeding the ANZECC freshwater  aquatic guideline of 
0.055 mg/L (Table 7) for two Bas sendean soils and th e duple x soil. Geochemical 
modelling of leach ates (PHREEQC and LeachXS) predict most o f the al uminium in soi l 
extracts is associated with DOC, which is considered to be less toxic to  sensitive 
receptors  (such as plants and fish) than t he free hydrated ion ; 
• Copper  and zinc in the three fertili sed soil s, which is attributed to the presence of  
trace element fertili ser residues. The alkaline, unfertilised Spearwood sand did not 
leach si gnificant concentrations of these metals ; 
• Slightly ele vate d concentrations o f solub le chromium above the ANZECC g uideline  for 
hexavalent chromium (0.001 mg/L1) we re pre sent in leachate s of Bassendean Joel and 
duplex soil samples  (information obtained from the  solution  speciation module of 
LeachXS) . However, the p redicted for m of s oluble chromium is D OC-bound trivalen t 
chromi um, which is far less toxic than the hexa valent form ; and  
• Leach ates from both Bassendean soil samples, and to a lesse r degree the duplex soil, 
contain elevated concentrations of phosphorus. As discussed in  Secti on 3, a  need to 
reduce phosphorus lea ching po tential from sandy soils on the Swan Coas tal Plain is a 
major d river for the need to evaluate by-products  as potentia l soil amendments.  
 
 
1   Note that tri gger value for certain metals and meta lloids have changed as a r esult of the ANZECC and 
ARMCANZ 2000 water quality guidelines being updated in 2018 (ANZG 2018). The revised trigger value for 
hexavalent chromium in sli ghtly to moderately disturbed freshwate r aquatic ecosystems has been reduced to 
0.0004 mg/L (0.4 µg/L).   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

77 5.3   Example 1 : How LEAF Can Be Used to As sess an Iluka By -product - Ironman 
Gypsum 
5.3.1 B y-product Ironman Gypsum (IMG) Characte risation  
Iluka produce s high grade synthetic rutile  by processing ilmenite ore using a modified Becher 
process . This process removes iron coatings from ilmeni te sand gra ins. In the final stages of th e 
proces s the synthetic rutile is wa shed with sul furic ac id to remove iron and manganese impurities.  
The iron -rich acid leach leach solution is neutralised by alkali addition , which results in p recipitatio n 
of soluble iron, ma nganese, sulfate and minor constituent s as hy drous iron and manganese oxides 
and sulfat e minerals. The result ed precipitated residue is used as a re -use by -product  with trade 
name Ironman Gypsum  (IMG) .   
Anal ysis of an earlier sample of I MG by CSIRO19 indicated a composition of primar ily gypsum 
(CaSO 4.2H 2O), with lesser quantities of magnet ite/maghemite ( Fe3O4/ϒ-Fe2O3), quartz and bassanite 
(CaSO 4.½H2O).  Geochemical analysis also showed that the IMG  contained substantial Fe 2O3 (present 
as poorly crystall ine hydrous Fe -oxides not detected using X -Ray Diffraction) in addition to CaO and 
SO 3, both present in gypsu m. 
Results for analysis of the sampl e of IMG  provided by Iluka for this study are presented in Table 8.

5.3.2 LE AF Tests 1313, 1314 and 1316  
5.3.2.1 LE AF 1313 Test  
Resu lts for analysis of I MG are presented as graphs in Appendix  A5-3. Characteristics of the pH 
dependent leaching characteristics by analyte for this mater ial are su mmarised as follows:  
Silver:  Apart fro m o ne slightly elevated value (approximately 0.0008 mg/L ) IMG at pH 8, 
concen trations were extremely low and did no t vary with p H. 
Aluminium: IMG indicated characteristic amphoteric behaviour for aluminium, w ith elevat ed 
concentrations at both very  low and  very high pH values.  The pH value for minimum solubili ty was 
between 7 and 8 pH unit s. 
Arsenic:  In general, the h ighest arsenic concentrations were recorded at the higher pH values, 
although solubility at l ow p H (2 a nd 4) was higher than those at  circum -neutral values. The solubility 
minima were between 6 and  8 pH units.  
Boron:  Boron concentrations  were low and  indicated very little dependence with leachate pH.   
Barium:   Leachate concentrations were typica lly <0.01 mg/L at leachate pH values abo ve 7.   Barium 
concentrations increased with decreasing pH.  
Bery llium:    Concentrati ons of extractable beryllium were very  low (0.0001 mg/L) at pH values above 
6 but increasing with increasing acidity below pH   6.  
Calcium:  Concentrations of extractable calcium decreased slightly with increasing pH, with leachate 
concentrations ranging f rom approximately 2,000 mg/L at pH 2 t o 800 mg/L at pH 13.  The measured 
concentrations and pH -dependent behaviour are consistent  with dissol ution of gypsum.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
79 Cadmium:  Con centrati ons of extractable cadmium very low, ranging between 0.0 01 and 0.0001 
mg/L wi thin the pH range of 5 to 11, with hig her concentrations (maximum 0.003 mg/L) at low pH.  
Cobalt:   IMG recorded elevated cobalt con cent ration s, notabl y at low pH (>5 mg/L at pH 2) .  Much 
lower concentrations (<0.0001 mg/L) were recorde d in alkaline (pH >8)  leachates.  
Chromium:  Elevated chromi um concentrations (>0.1 mg/L) were recorded at both very low and very 
high pH values.    Much  lower con centrations were recorded for leachate s with pH values between 6 
and 8.  
DOC:  Very low DOC con centrations (approxim ately 1 mg/L) were shown at all pH val ues. 
Copper:  Copper leachates indicated characteristic amphoteric behaviour. The pH minimum for 
copper  solubility was approximately at 6 pH.  
Fluoride:   Fluoride leaching was relatively constant ( approximately 0.2 mg/ L) across the pH range.  
Iron.  IMG re corded consistent iron concentrations of approximately 0.01 mg/L between pH 4 and 
12.  Very hi gh values (>10 mg/L) of soluble iron wer e record ed at very low pH.    
Mercury:  Apart from minor anomalo us concentrations bet ween 0.0001 and 0.001 mg/L, most 
merc ury concentrations were <0.0001 mg/L across the pH range.  
Potassium:  Potassium concentrations  were simi lar and consistent (approximat ely 5 – 10 mg/L) for 
pH values below 8.   Higher concentrations at pH >8 were an anal ytical artefact arising from use of 
KOH to adjust leachate alkalinity.  
Magnesium :   Magnesium leaching characteristics were similar  to those described earlier for calcium,  
i.e. ma ximum solubility at low pH with concentrations decreasin g with increasing lea chate alkalinity 
(to <0.005 mg/L at p H >10).  
Manganese :  Leachate concentrations decreasing with increasing pH. IMG showed leachate  
concentra tions exceeding 10 mg/L for p H values below 6.   
Molybdenum :     Leachate concentrations were very low at low pH bu t increased with increasing p H 
at va lues greater than 6.    
Sodium :   As expected for a conservative ion such as sodium, leachate c once ntrati ons did not vary 
with p H.   IMG releas ed very little soluble sodium (typically <5 mg/L) . 
Nicke l:   Nickel was simil ar to cobalt in that IMG reco rded el evated concentrations (>0.5 mg/L at low 
pH, but much lower  concentrations under circum -neutral and alkali ne conditions.    
Phosphorus :   Phosph orus concentrations were low (<0. 1 mg/L) in all leachate s. 
Lead :   Lead was n ot leached at elevated concen tration s. Concentrations in circum -neutral and 
alkaline leachates were generally below the reporting l imit (<0.0 002 mg/L).  Values of approxim ately 
0.01 mg/L were recorded in the most acidic leachates (pH 2) .  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
80 Sulfur : The pH depe ndence curves for sulfur indi cated c oncentrations of approximately 700  to 800 
mg/L between 4 and 10 pH units, and slightly higher c once ntrati ons at pH 2 and pH >10.   
Antimony :   Concentrations of antimony in leachates were at or below  the limit of detecti on 
(<0.0001  to <0.001  mg/L) a t all p H values.    
Selenium.  Selenium concentrations in IMG leachates were low and not pH dependent.  
Silicon :   Silicon concentrations were  variable  and decreased with increasing pH.  The maximum 
concentr ation was 100 mg/L at  pH 2, while the minim um concentrati on was 0.2 mg/L at pH 12.  
Tin:  Tin concentrations were at or below the method reporting limit betw een pH  values of 6 and 11.   
Titani um:  Titanium concentrations were below the method report limits at all but the most a cidic 
pH (pH 2).  Conc entrations in pH 2 leachates ranged from 0.006 to 0.009 mg/L, which is consistent 
with the de pletion of titan ium-contai ning minerals in this  process  residue stream.  
Thallium :  Thallium concentrations in all leacha tes were below the me thod reporting limit ( 0.0001 
mg/L)  
Uranium :  Uranium concentrations in leachates of IMG were 0.01 to 0.02mg/L over the pH interval 
of 4 to 10 .  Higher concentrations (app roximatel y 0.2 mg/L) were recorded in pH 2 leachates.  
Vanadium :  Concentrations in IMG  leachates were below the method rep orting limit  across the pH 
range . 
Zinc:     IMG contained elevated concentrations (concen tratio ns (0.1 to  0.3 mg/L) of zinc in pH 2 
leachates.  Concentrations decreased with increasing pH up to pH 12 . 
Results from the LE AF Method 1313 were us ed to identify  constituents of potential concern (CoPC) 
in IMG based on methodology discussed in a document p ublished b y the US -EPA in October 2017  
(refer also to Section 4.11) .  This me thodology is based on LEAF test results for:  
• The Available Content, defined as the maximum concentr ation at end -point eluate pH 
values of 2, 9 and 13 . 
• The maximum eluate concentra tion over the defined “applicable  scena rio pH 
domain”.  For applicat ion of IM G as a soil amendment of Sw an Coastal Plain sand y 
soils, the applicable scenario pH domain  was cons idered to be 5 .5 to 9.0 pH units.  
The adopted methodology is summarised as follo ws: 
• Calculate the leachate concen tratio ns based on:  
▪ Available Conten t (mg/kg)  or; 
▪ Applicable scenario pH  domain (mg/kg) ; 
▪ L/S ratio of 10 (for Method 1313) ; 
▪ Dilution and Attenu ation Factor ( DAF) using a non -specific  nominal value  
of 10 , which accounts for r educed concentrations  between the leachate 
source (i.e leaching from  IMG) and the point of compliance i n the rec eiving  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
81 enviro nment (which may be down -gradient groundwater or a surface 
waterbody , depending on lo cation ); and  
▪ Upper and lower threshold constit uent  values listed in Table 6, for 
assessment of soil leachate conce ntrati ons from the tall column stud y 
(Sectio n 5.2.4) . 
Analytes where all concentrations were below the “lower threshold” values listed in Tabl e 6 have 
very  low potential for environmental impact. All other analytes may warrant further investigation 
(Table 9), some of these are discussed belo w. 
It is important to  note that this approach to risk screening is based on that used i n Europe and 
elsewhere mainly  for materials stored as waste, and not for beneficial re -use as soil amendment 
products. Factors such a s inte nded application rates and int eraction of product constituents with soil 
(both mobilisation  and attenuation) have not be en considered.  In effect, this method provides a 
first pass, high level assessment of constituents of p otenti al concern that require fu rthe r evaluation, 
as disc ussed  in subsequent sections.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

Based on these resu lts, IMG  constituent s that may  leach a t potentially environmentally significant 
concentrations under typical soil pH conditions ( pH 5.5 to 9), as predicted by LEAF Method 1313 
data , are summarised (in no particular order of ris k) as follows:  
• Aluminium . 
• Cobalt. 
• Chromium.  
• Manga nese.  
• Nickel.  
• Salinity (as calcium and sulfate).  
 
In addition, LEAF 1313 data suggests that cadmium, copper, molybdenum and zinc may leach at 
elevated  concentrations  at very low pH conditions (pH 2 to 4).   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
83 5.3.2.2 LE AF Test Resu lts, Met hods 131 4 and  1316, L/S Depend ence  
Results for analysis of by -products (IMG ) using method 1314 (up -flow percolation) are presented as 
charts in Appendix A6 -3.  Corresponding results using  method 131 6 (batch equilibration) are 
presented in Appendix A7 -3. 
For most a nalytes pres ent in measura ble concentrations, leachate concentrations usually decrease 
with increasing L/S ratio. This observation is indicative of “solute wash out” behaviour, th at is a 
substantial proporti on of each solute occurs in “free ” form, and not associa ted w ith a specific  
mineral phase (other than association with dissolved organic carbon).   
The other type of leachate behaviour occurs in the presence of sparingly soluble mineral pha ses, 
which form saturated solutions containing comparable analyte concentratio ns at all L/S ratios.  
Results presented for calcium and sulfate in Figures 2 1 and 2 2 provide an example of mineral control 
for dissolution of these constituents (most  likely as gypsum, CaSO 4.2H 2O). 
Results presented in Appendix A6 -3 indicate t ypically lea chate concentr ations between these two 
types of solute behaviour. Analytes indicating predominantly ‘conservative ion’ behaviour include 
bromide, chloride, sodium and potassium, regardless of material type. Analytes indicating 
predomina ntly ‘sp aringly solu ble mineral ph ase’ behaviour include barium, silicon, fluoride and 
importantly calcium and sulfur in IMG (which contains gypsum as the principal constituent) , Figure s 
20 and 2 1. 
Many analytes demonstrate behaviour between these type ext remes. T his behaviou r is likely to  
occur whe n other processes affect solute behaviour, such as:  
• Ion exchange reactions, particularly with clay and humic phases.  
• Surface adsorption to vari ably charge d amorphous mineral phases, especially hydrous ferric, 
aluminium a nd manganese  oxides  (colle ctively referred to as “hydrous ferric oxides – HFO”) . 
• Changes in leachate pH in response to increasing L/S ratio.  
• Changes in ionic strength (salinity) o f leachate,  which decreases with increasing L/S of 
materials containi ng signi ficant amoun ts of soluble salts. 
• Changes in leachate concentrations of solutes capable of forming stable complexes with 
metal ions as a function of L/S, especially dissolved organ ic carbon, and also ions including 
fluoride, sulfate and phosphate.

86 5.3.3 LeachXS material characterisation and Chemic al Speci ation Finger prints  
LeachXS  is a comp uter software package that supports LEAF test data management by:  
• Graphical and tabular presentation of data;  
• Statistical analysis of data;  
• Providing a to ol for quality control;  
• Chemical speciation analysis, i.e.  identif ying key min eral phases th at c ontrol the 
dissolution/precipitation over the pH range of 2 to 13; and  
• Scenario modelling, such a solute transfer from single stream by -products, ble nds of 
different by -product materials, or blends of by -products and s oil. 
 
This Section p resents result s ob tained from LeachXS modelling to create geochemical speciation 
“fingerprints ” of IMG . LeachXS  uses the following informatio n to generate the geochemical 
“finger print”:  
• pH dependence (Method 1313) leachate analysis d ata. 
• The re lationship b etween leacha te pH  and the amount of acid or alkali added, i.e. the 
material’s pH titration curve.  
• Dissolved humic acid (DHA) content in each  leachate, which is calculated as a f raction of 
dissolved organic carbon (typically 20% to 4 0%). DHA ha s the capaci ty to form so luble  
complexes with many transition metals, notably copper, cadmium, nickel and lead.  
• Clay content (mg/kg).  Clay minerals have  a net negative charge, which results  on solid phase 
interactions with cationic species.  
• Hydrous ferric  oxide (HFO) . These mater ials, which include hydrous aluminium and 
manganese oxides, have very high surface areas and variable surface charge (which is p H 
dependent). They can therefore reta in anionic species by surface adsorption at low pH and 
catio nic sp ecies by sur face adsorpti on at  high pH. 
• A thermodynamic database containing data for oxide, carbonate, silicate, sulfide and DHA 
mineral phases of  potent ially environmentally significant met als and metalloids. Minteq 
version 4 was used as the th ermod ynamic  database fo r this study.  
• Initial pH and pE (redox potential) values.  The pE values were estimated from a “rule of 
thumb” relationship  (Equation 1)18 applied  for LeachXS modelling in the ab sence of reliable 
experimental data .

89 5.3.3.1 Ironm an Gyp su m  (IMG)  
Discussion in this se ction focuses on three  of the constituents of  IMG that were identified in Section 
5.3.2.1 with potential for (site -specific) environmental impacts; manganese, chro mium and sulfate  
(as salinit y).  Copper is also included in this discussion as it provides a good example of the LeachXS 
capacity for providing chemical speciation fingerprints.  
The chemical speciation fingerprint charts for manganese are presented in Figure 2 2.  Key 
pred ictio ns pres ented in these charts indicate the following:  
• LeachXS  modelling p rovides a reasonable description of the solubility of manganese under 
acidic (pH <6) conditions, but under -estimate s solubility at high pH (> 8 pH units) ; 
• Manganes e behaves predomi nantl y as a conservative soluble species at low pH (pH <6), with  
increasing m ineral phase solubility control under alkaline conditions ; 
• “Free” manganese is the exclusive phase at low pH (<6 units) and at L/S = 10.  Although not 
included in  LeachXS predicti ons (althoug h suggest capability exists) , most of the soluble 
manganese is ex pected to be present as the divalent ion (Mn2+); 
• DOC -bound manganese is the dominant form of soluble manganese at high pH, although 
concentrations of soluble mang anese are predict ed to  be ver y low ( <0.00001 mg/L at pH 12 
and L/S = 10) ; 
• The sol id phase pres ent at alkaline pH values consists mainly of the oxide mineral pyrolusite, 
MnO 2 in which manganese is present in the tetravalent state (at pE = 10).  At lower pE (pE = 
6, chart no t sho wn), an other manganese oxide, manganite, MnOOH, in which ma nganese is 
present in the trivalent state , was predicted to be the stable mineral in this pH/pE domain . 
Manganese associated with iron oxide phases is a secondary component ; and 
• At very high p H (>1 3 pH un its), a solid mineral phase designated at “ettr _ss” is predicted to 
form. This is related to the mineral ettringite (hydrated Ca 6Al2(SO 4)3(OH) 12) by partial 
subst itution  of aluminium by trivalent manganese  (or calcium by divale nt manganese) . 
It is i mportan t to note that other stable  manganese minerals, such  as psilomela ne, 
Ba(Mn2+)(Mn4+)8O16(OH) 4, or birnessite, (Na 0.3Ca0.1K0.1)(Mn4+,Mn3+)2O4.1.5 H 2O) were  predicted to be 
stable under the nominal redox conditions (pE = 10) adopt ed for the LeachX S mod el. The se minerals, 
which are common constituents of mangan ese ore  in WA , are stable under oxic conditions.

90 The chemical spec iatio n finge rprint charts for chromium in IMG are presented in Figure 2 3. Key 
predictions presented in these charts indicate the following:  
• LeachXS  modelling provides a reasonable description of the solubility of chromium under 
acidic and slightly alkaline  cond itions (pH < 8) conditions, but over -estimates the solubili ty at 
high pH  (>10 pH units) ; 
• Chromium behaves predominantly as a conservative soluble species at very low pH (pH < 4), 
with increasing mineral phase solubility control under a lkaline (8 to 10  pH uni ts) con ditions ; 
• “Free” chromium is the exclusive phase at low pH (<3 un its) and high pH (>10 pH units) at 
L/S = 10.  Although not included in these LeachXS predictions, most of the soluble chromium 
is expected to be present as the tr ivalent ion (Cr3+) in a cidic c onditions and varying 
proportion of trivalent (Cr(O H)4-) and hex avalent (CrO 42-) oxyanions at high pH , depending on 
redox  (pE) conditions  (information obtained from the  solution  speciation module of 
LeachXS) ; 
• DOC -bound chromium is the dominant form of solu ble chromium between pH 4 and 6, with 
predicted concentrations of  approximately 0.01 mg/L (at L/S = 10) in leachates with  pH 
within th is range ; and  
• The dominant solid phase, which represents most of the available chromium within  the pH 
range 4 to 8. 5, is t hat associated with iron oxides.  
It is i mportant to note that Lea chXS does not include the common chromium mineral chromi tite, 
FeCr 2O4, which is a common, highly stable chromium mineral present in WA soils.

strongly acidic (pH ~2) conditions and  over estimate s the solubility under slightly acidic, 
circum -neutral and alkaline conditions ;  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
91 • Copper behaves predominantly as  a co nservat ive soluble species at low pH (pH <4), with 
increasing mineral ph ase solubility control with increasing pH, and especial ly under alka line 
(>10 pH units) conditions ; 
• “Free” copper is the exclusive phase at low pH (<4 units) and v ery high pH (>13  pH u nits) a t 
L/S = 10.  Although not included in these LeachXS predictions, most of the soluble copper is 
expected to be present as  the divalent  hydrated ion (Cu2+) in acidic conditions and the 
hydroxide complex anion [Cu(OH) 4]2-, which is  only stable in stron gly alk aline solutions. 
Depending on redox con ditions, some copper may b e present as the monovalent cuprous 
ion (Cu+), which is  only stable under strongly reducing conditions ; 
• Most of the dissolved copper in leachates with pH values be tween 7 and 11 i s pre dicted to 
be present in association with DOC  compounds, at predicted con centrations of 
approximately 0.01 mg/L (at L/S = 10) ; and 
• Most of th e available copper is predicted to apportion to solid phases at pH values between 
4 and 13 unit s. The dominant predi cted ph ase at pH 5 to 9 pH units is copper ass ociated with 
iron oxide ph ases.  The oxide mineral tenorite (CuO) is predicted to  be the domin ant mineral 
phase at leachate pH >9 pH units.

The chemical speciat ion fingerprint charts for  sulfate-sulfur in IMG are presented in Figure 2 5. Key 
predictions p resented in these charts indicate the following:  
• LeachXS  modelling generally overestimates the solubility of su lfate-sulfur at all pH values, 
but especially with in the range of 8 to 11 pH units; 
• Sulfate-sulfur is predicted to behave as a cons ervative spec ies across the complete pH range ; 
• At L/S = 10, sul fate-sulfur is predicted to be present mainly in the solid pha se as  the mi neral 
gypsum, with solution concentrat ions of approximately 2,000  mg/L ; and    
• Under alkaline (pH >7) conditions, gypsum  is predicted  to dissolve with release of its sul fate-
sulfur component (with concentrations up to 5,000 mg/L at L/S = 10).  T his m ay be e xplained 
by the calcium in gypsum prec ipitating at less soluble c arbonate minerals (such as calcite, 
CaCO 3) as the conc entrations of  carbonate and bicarbonate ions increase with increasing pH.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

93 5.3.4.1  Ironman Gypsum  and Basse ndean E llenbrook Soil Blend  
Predicted chemica l speciation fingerprints fo r the virtual material comprising a blend of IMG (5% by 
weight) wi th Bassendean Ellenbrook sand are presented in Appendix A10 -2.  For many analytes , the 
chemica l speciation finge rprin ts are mainly influenced by the Bassendean El lenbrook sand 
component.  Ex ceptions also arise in the case of analytes that are a major compo nent of IMG and a 
minor component of the soil – as indicated in Figure 27 for manganese and Fi gure 28 for sul fate. Th e 
chemi cal speciation fingerprint for the ble nded  soil has characteristic s of both the natural soil and 
IMG , which is to be ex pected  given that manganese is a major component of IMG, but only present 
in trace amounts in Bassendean El lenbrook soil.  
Similar ly, the  solution and mineral phase concentrat ions of sul fate in IMG is controlled by dissolution 
of gypsum; predicted leachate  concentratio ns of sulfate (L/S = 10, pH =7) from IMG is  predicted to 
be approximately 2,000 mg/L  up to pH 8 and increases th ereaf ter.  Much lower concentrations 
(approximatel y 10 mg/L) are predicted in leachates of Bassendean (Ellenbrook) sand over the entire 
pH range , with only minimal control by solid phases (FeOxide, clay and particulate organic matter, 
POM ).  Note that Leac hXS d oes not  predict the much lower sulfate concen trations (0.01 to 0.02 
mg/L)  observed in acidic (pH <6) leachates of Bassen dean sand.  The che mical speciation fingerprint 
predicted by LeachXS for the blended soil indicate leachate conce ntrations (at L/S = 10)  of 
approximately 300 mg/L, which is below so lubility control by gypsum.  Interestingly, the only 
discrete solid mineral  phase predicted by  LeachXS in the blended soil is barite (BaSO 4), which was 
not predicted by LeachXS to occur in  either IMG or Bas sende an (Ell enbrook) sand . 
It is important to note  that the available content of sulfate was determined to be 56,800 mg/kg (a s 
SO 4), which is ba sed on the maximum solubility of sulfur at L/S ratio. As IMG contains approximately 
60% gypsum  by weight, the ac tual availab le content (assuming complete dissolut ion of gypsum) is 
calculated  to be 327,000 mg/kg.  Therefore, it is  expected that the actual a vailable content of sulfur 
(and calcium) is approximately 5.8 times that calculated by LeachXS  from LEAF Method 1313 data 
(L/S = 10).   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

5.3.5.1 Tall Column E xp eriment  
As discussed in Section 4.10.2 , a large column exper iment was set up a s follows:  
A surface layer of either amended soil (using IMG materials as amen dment)  was applied at the 
application r ate equivalents to 50 t/ha/ 10 cm layer for the soil amendment materials . 
Leachates were collected on three occasions, as summarised in Sect ion 4 .10.2.1 (designated as Time 
1, 2 and 3).  
At each sampling event, leachate s were collected from:  
• Immediately belo w the amended soil/material  layer;  
• Draining the tap at the base of the column prior to flushing, i.e. sampling interstiti al 
water from soil  void s from the initial setting up of the column a nd subsequent 
leaching event s; and  
• Collecting leachate from the bas e of the column after the f lushing event described in 
Section 4.10.2.1.  
 
Results for analysis of the leachates are tabula ted in Table A1 1-1 of A ppendix  A11.   In addition, 
results for all an alytes are plotted as charts  presented in Appendix 12.   Each chart shows the 
concentrations fo r the specific analyte and soil type from the three leachate sampling points 
collected on thre e occasions (colou red l ines an d markers), with the corresponding res ults from the 
“control” colu mns (i.e. no amended soil and residue m aterial cover layer) as bla ck dashed lines (no 
markers).  
Analytes where all concentrations from the flushed column sample s were  below the “ lower  
thresh old” values listed in Table  6 have very low potential  for environ mental impact. All other 
analytes may  warrant further investigat ion (Table 12), some of these are discussed below . 
In many cases, it is observed that the leacha te concentration s from the f lushing of the column are 
controlled m ainly by the soil material rat her than the amendment material.  Exceptions to this 
general observation are discussed in grea ter detail in the following sections.  
Potential for mobilisation o f specific const ituent s from  IMG 
Based on t he tall column experime nt, key potential constituent s from soils amended with IMG 
include:  
• Sulfate in leachates of Bassendean Joel and Spearwood sa nds;  
• Phosphorus . Although IMG  has been identified as an effective means of reducin g 
phosp horus  leaching from sandy soils, elevated c oncentrations were recorded in  leachates 
from the tall column experiments.  However, it is to be noted that the “subsoil” la yer in the 
tall column experiment was actually topsoil containing elevated concent rations  of labile 
phosphoru s.  In field situations , the natural subsoils would b e expected to contain much 
lower concentrations of potentially labile phosphorus ; 
• Minor concen trations of trace metals present in fertilised soils; and   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
97 • Apart fr om mobilising tr ace amo unts of molybdenum, application of IMG to S pearwood sand 
resulted in litt le change to leachate concentration. It is unlikely that IMG would be required 
as a soil amend ment material for Spearwood sand . 
An important finding was that ma nganese was not present  in e nvironmentally significant 
concentrati ons in any soil leachates, des pite being a major constituent of IMG and found to be 
moderately soluble at under acidic condi tions, including natural sandy soil pH values, from the LEAF 
tests  (Section 5. 3.2.1).

5.3.5.2.1 Ironman Gyps um (IMG) Ellenbrook Trial  
A tr ial was established in 2011 on Department of Defence land to assess the effectiveness of 
Ironman Gypsum  (IMG ), together  with Alkaloam and another  Water Corporat ion material  (Section 
4.10.1 .1). These amendments were applied to leaching sandy soils of the El lenbrook catchment to 
assess their suitability for use to retain phosphorus (P) on croppin g land. Note: these amendments  
were applied to the soil surface and we re not incorpora ted int o the  soil profile . Three lysimeters 
were i nstalled within nine 3 x 3 met re small plots to collect leachate from soil over different rain 
events during winter and spring from 2011 to 2017. Initially depth wise (0 -10 cm , 10-20 cm, 20 -30 
cm and 30 -40 cm) soi l sam pling was conducted to assess the nutr ient and metals movement down 
the profile and later only topsoil samples were analysed.  
Results from analyses of lysimet er leachates sampled on 20 occasions between June 2012 and June 
2017 a re presented in Appendi x A 1 4.  A summary of key findings is prese nted as a risk profile table 
(Table 1 3) using the same analyte threshold concentration presented in Table 6 for the tall  column 
experiment (Section 5. 3.5.1 ). Risk profiles are  presented for “short term” (en d of 20 12) a nd “long 
term” ( 2017) leachates.  
Compa rison of the risk profile of I MG from the Ellenbrook trial (Table 1 3) with that of the tall column 
laboratory trial (Tab le 1 2, Section 5. 3.5.1) indicate  that the “short term” potential risks  are 
comparable.   Howev er, a  short term and long -term risk  for lea chate acidification (pH) was r ecorded 
for the field trial on the basis of leachate pH values being below the adopted thr eshold value of 4.5.

100 5.3.5.2. 2 Ironman G ypsum (IMG)  – Bullsbrook Turf Trial  
Comparisons of results of LEAF test methods 1314 and 1316 (i.e. at the natural pH of IMG ) with 
lysimet er (section 4.10 .1.3) water sample analysis data are presented in Table 1 4. 
Comparison of availa ble data indicate s general agreement of LEAF test results with field test results 
with the following exceptions:  
• Concentrations of arsenic, barium, copper, iron , potassium, man gane se, sodium, nickel, 
phosphorus, lead, selenium , thorium, titanium, chloride,  vanadium and zin c were higher in the 
field samples.  In each case, the differences were explained by either:  
o Contributions from irrigation water;  
o Contributions  from applied fe rtiliser; and 
o Release from historical soil contami nation or naturally elevated l evels in soil, as  indicated by 
similarity of results from amended and non -amended plots.  
Concentrations of boron, chromium, magnesium and uranium were lower in the field sample s.  The 
decrease in boron, chromium and uranium co ncentrations may be attributed  to interactions with 
soil organic matter in the amended soil plots.

102 5.3.6  LeachXS Solute Transport Modelling – Comparison with Field and Laboratory 
Column Leaching Data  
5.3.6.1 Model Conditions  
The predictive percolation colu mn s olute transport module of LeachXS was used to simulate leaching 
characterist ics for the follo wing scenarios:  
• A blended layer of 10 cm of 5% IMG and Bassendean Ellenbrook sand overlying a 90 cm layer 
of Bassendean Ellenbrook sand.  
 
These  scenarios were designed to reflect the conditions of the tall col umn leaching experiment 
(Secti on 4.10.1.1) and in the case of IMG, the highest application rates of the Ellenbrook field trial 
(Section 4.10.2), noting that the materials were applied as a s urface layer and  not incorporated by 
mixing in the topsoil layer.  
In addition to the chemical sp eciation fingerpr ints for each material, including the virtual materials 
representing the 5% blends of IMG with Bassendean Ellenbrook sand, LeachXS also require s model 
input pa rame ters for: 
• Column density ; 
• Column diameter ; 
• Num ber of “cells” ; 
• Column length ; 
• Column mobile fr action ; 
• Phase distance ; 
• Column porosity ; 
• Permeating solution ; and  
• Out of column flow rate.  
 
Values for model input parameters for the three mod elled scenarios are presented in Table 1 5. For 
several parameters relating to the hydraulic char acteristics of th e materials, nominal values were 
used rather than measured values. the nominal values adopted were considered to be indicative of 
free draining  sandy materials  on the Swan Coastal Plain. The addition of the by -products in the 
blended soil (IMG) was assumed  not to alter the hydraulic characteristics of the soil (Bassendean 
Ellenbrook).

104 5.3.6.2 Model Output Interpretation  
LeachXS percolati on output result s were presented in four charts formats, from whi ch bottom of 
column leachate co ncentrations cou ld be calculated for each scenario and subsequently compared 
with field trial data and tall column laboratory leachate data (Section 5. 3.5).  Ex amples of these 
formats , using aluminium in the virtual column of  5% IMG blended with Bassendean  Ellenbrook sand  
(2 cells, 10 cm depth) over Bassendean Ellenbrook sand (18 cells, 10 -100 cm) are presented in 
Figures 29 and 30.  Interpretations of the predi cted results are  discus sed thereafter.  
Figure 29 presents the vol umetric concentrations of speci fic solid and so lid phases, on a whole 
column volumetric basis, for aluminium at an L/S = 0.404  as a function of column depth. Key points 
provided by presentati on of modelled d ata in this format are:  
• The volumetric concentrat ion of “available content” alum inium in the fir st two cells is 
approximately 250 mg/L, some  of which is associated with IMG in the blended soil layer.  
• The volumetric concentration of “availab le content” alum inium i n the underlying cells is 
lower, and appro ximately 150 mg/L, correspondin g to the origina l concentration in 
Bassendean Ellenbrook sand.  This indicates there has been very little mass transfer of 
aluminium from the amended soil layer  to the underlyi ng soil layer. 
• The dominant form of aluminium in both layers was predicted by Le achXS to be amor phous 
aluminium hydroxide (from a cement materials database) (Al(OH) 3), rather than crystalline 
hydrous oxide minerals such as gibbsite or boehm ite.  The other major m ineral form of 
aluminium in both layers is  the sodium feldspar mineral al bite ( NaAlSi₃O₈ ). 
• An important solid phase component of aluminium in Bassendean soil layers is that associated 
with particulate organic matter (POM).  
• The concen tration of solut ion phase aluminium (DOC -bound + free), but expre ssed on a 
column volumetric basis rat her than a  solution phase volumetric basis, decreases from 
approximately 0. 2 mg/L within and immediately below the amended soil layer.  
• The volumetric conc entration of sol ution phas e aluminium decreases to approximately 0.01 
mg/L  in the lower layers  of the column.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

Figure 30 presents the volumetric concentrations of specific solid and solid  phases, on a wh ole 
column  volumetric basis, for aluminium at the  100 cm layer (base of column) as a f unction of  L/S, 
effectively providing predicted information relating to “out of column” leachate composition as 
function of leachate volume. Key points pr ovided by presen tation of modelled data in this format 
are: 
• The m odel output mainly depends on the val idity of m obile fraction and effective phase 
distance used in the model. The solution concentration will decrease with the increase in 
mobile fraction. Th e pH dependent d ata for Al  shows the effect of pH change under ch anging 
“exposure” conditions in case of solubil ity control. The change in L/S ratio from 0.2 to 0.5 
suggests an increase in pH values from 7.8 to 8 and the soluble Al concentration increased 
(Figure 30). This points a t solubility control by the combination  of phases controlling Al 
solubility.  The model  describes washout of DOC, however the model does not take into 
account generation of new DOC, which is likely under the long -term  test conditio ns in the 
column  study.  
• The “first flush” leachate concentration of approximately 0.02 mg/L aluminium (allowing for 
conversion of column volume to solution phase volume), comprised of exclusively DOC -bound 
aluminium.  
• As the solution phase ratio increases, the concentratio n of solub le aluminium is predicted to 
decrease a nd contain increasing proportion of f ree aluminium.  
• The decrease in liquid phase aluminium is accompanied by proportional increases of POM -
bound aluminium in the solid phase.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

107 5.3.6.3 Comparison of LeachXS Predictions with Field and Tall Column Results  
5.3.6.3.1 Comp arison M ethodology  
Predicted end of colum bbn leachate concentrations from LeachXS modelling descri bed in Sec tion 
5.3.6. 2 were compared with results  from field results (Ellenbrook trial  for IMG) and laboratory tall 
column leachate data using the following methodology:  
• Predicted end of column leachate concentration (sum of DOC -bond and fr ee fractions) as  a 
functio n of L/S, as calculated from LeachXS ou tput data illustrated by Figure 31 (Section 
5.3.6.2).  
• Tall column bottom of column leachate concentrations for three sampling events (Leach 
Number 1, 2 and 3) discussed in Section 4.10.2.1 . 
• Lysimeter leachat e con centr ations from the first eight sampling ev ents from the Ellenbrook 
Trial (Secti on 4.10.1.1)  for IMG.  When comparing LeachXS predictions with Ellenbrook 
lysimeter data, it is important to recognise that IMG was applied on top of the s oil surface  and 
was n ot bl ended with topsoil in the field tr ial. 
 
Data from these three sources were p lotted as a composite chart, as illustrated by Figure 31 
presenting calcium concentrations for IMG applied to Bassendean Ellenbrook sand.  
Information pres ented in Figure 31 for calcium is interpreted as follows:  
• LeachXS  predicts calcium concentrations in t he initial leachates to be approximately 1,00 0 
mg/L, which will increase to a maximum of approximately 1,00 0 mg/L as the “first flush” from 
dissolution of  gypsum from IMG  in the bl ended soil layer reaches the bottom of column.  
Concentrations thereafter ar e predicted to decrease  until the L/S ratio reached 1.0 , by which 
time most of the soluble column had been flushed from the column . 
• Lysimeter data for the  Ellenbrook fiel d tra il indicates calcium concentrations ranging from 500 
to 700 mg/L, which aligns re asonably well with LeachXS predicted concentrations  during the 
wash -out period . The field data reflects two years of leaching which, depending on frequenc y 
and intensity of ra infal l events, correspond to L/S ratios grea ter than 1.0.  
• Tall column leachate co ncentrations ranged from approximately 160 to 350 mg/L and showed 
an increasing trend with time. The results align reasonably well with the lower range of  
leachate concen trati ons p redicted by LeachXS. While  comparing Le achXS predictions with tall 
column le achate data, it is important to recognise that the tall columns were flushed with 
leaching fluid in a short period of time, but at intervals separated by four months.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

Charts comparing predicted end of column leachate concent rations using Le achXS  with Ellenbrook 
field trial leachate concen trations and tall column laboratory l eachate concentrations for selected 
analytes are presented in Appendix A19.  
The following discussion focuses on analytes that were  identified as con stituents of potential  
conc ern from assessment of the potential risk pr ofiles derived from interpretation of  LEAF test s 
(Table 9), tall column  (Table 12) and field trial (Table 13) results:  
• Sulfate ; 
• Manganese ; 
• Nickel ; 
• Cobalt;  
• Cadmium ( residual fertiliser cadmium  from  Ellenbrook field tr ial observations) ; 
• Alumi nium; and  
• Barium . 
 
Sulfate  
Comparison data f or sulfate leaching characteristics a re presented in Figure 32. Comparison of 
LeachXS predicted concentrations with field and laboratory trial concentrations indicate predicted 
concentrati ons were approximat ely d ouble the measured concentrations. The diffe rence is 
considered acceptable given the inherent assumptions and differences between modelled and trial 
conditions.  It was noted that LeachXS predicted end of column leachate concentrati ons greater than  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
109 that of  a saturated gypsum solution  at low L/S , whe reas the field and laboratory trial d ata suggest 
under -saturation with respect to gypsum.  
It is noted that LeachXS does not predict extended concentrations of sulfate (and calcium) at 
elevated concentrations  for relatively high L/S ratios, which would be e xpected for a material 
containing 60%  gypsum.  As discussed in Section 5.3.2.1, LeachXS has underestimated the available 
content of sulfur (and calcium) in IMG by a factor of 5.8, which wo uld explain the “wa sh-out” 
leaching curve, rather than the gypsum eq uilibration curves indicated by the t all column and 
Ellenbrook trial (Figure 3 2).

Manganese  
Comparison data for manganese  leaching characteristics are present ed in Figure 33. Comparison of 
LeachXS predicted concentrations with field and laboratory trial concentrations comparable with  
field and laboratory mea sured concentration s at a nominal pE value of 8 . Substantially highe r 
concentrations were predicted by Le achXS when lower nominal pE values were used.  The difference 
was pre -empted by discussion in previous Sections (Sections 5. 3.3.1  and 4.10.1.2)  which  noted the 
sensitivity  of m anganese speciation to redox conditions.

Concentrations from the tall column trial (maximum 0.001 mg/L) and the Ellenbrook  field 
trial (maxim um 0. 0015 mg/L) were several orders of magnitude higher, but do not ind icate 
chromium to be a constituent of potential concern.  
• LeachXS predicted slightly elevated, first -flush concentrations of soluble vanadium 
(maximum 0.5 mg/L), where as tall column and Ellen brook field trial data indicated 
consistentl y low vanadium concent rations (maximu m 0.001 mg/L).

112 Cadmium  
Comparison data for cadmium leaching characteristics are presented in Figure 36. LeachXS predicted 
gene rally  low end of column cadmium concentrations, w hich was consistent wi th measured lea chate 
concentrations from the tall column experiment. The relatively higher  concentrations measured in 
the Ellenbrook field tr ial may be a consequence of different concen trati ons of cadmium from 
superphosphate residues in the field trial soi l compared to t he soil submitted for laboratory column 
experiments  in this project . 
These results indicate that cadmium is not considered to be a constituent of poten tial concern  in 
IMG .

Comparison data for aluminium  leaching characteristics are presented in Figure 3 7. LeachXS 
predicted generally  low end of column cadmium concentrations  followi ng a first -flush of so luble 
aluminium  at concentrations up to 0.2 mg/L. This observation is  consistent with measured leachate 
concentrations from the tall column experiment. Elevated conce ntrations, up to 0. 8 mg/ L were 
measured in lysimeter leachates from the Ellenbrook field t rial, which may  be explained by the 
presence of very fine aluminium - particulate organic matter material forming in the lysimeters prior 
to subsequent standing.

Although barium was not identified as a constituent of potential concern in IMG from high level 
assessment of LEAF Me thod 1313 results ( Secti on 5.3.2.1, Table 8), LeachXS modelling pred icted 
elevated barium concentrations (up to 8 mg/L, Figure 3 8) in a “first -flush” event, followed by much 
lower concentrations (below the adopted lower threshold value of 2 mg/L) as L/S in creased above 
0.3 L/kg.  The tall column experiment indicated consis tent leachate concentr ations of appro ximately 
0.2 mg/L, which were comparable with LeachXS predictions at L/S = 1.

114 5.3.7 Summary  
Comparison for laboratory LEAF Method  1313 results, LeachXS solute transport modelling, tall 
column laboratory trials and the Ellenbrook field trial provides the following key points for 
consideration by  WA regulators for appro val of IMG as an amendment for Bassendean sa nds at 
application rat es up to 50 t/h a: 
• LEAF Method 1313 results identified aluminium, manganese, cobalt, nickel and (sulfate) 
salinity as constituents of potential concern in IMG, especia lly under acidic fi eld c onditions.  
• LeachXS provided sensible chemica l speciation fingerpri nts for these c onstituents of 
potential concern in IMG.  The corresponding chemical speciation fingerprints of these 
elements, and others of general environmental int erest, in Bassendea n san d indicate major 
control of solubility by in teraction with dissolv ed and part iculate soil organic matter, rather 
than clay, hydrous ferric oxides or discrete mineral phases.  
• LeachXS predicted “first -flush” washout characteristics fo r most elements, i. e. mo st of the 
leaching occurred at low L/S ratio s (less than 0.3) .  This behaviour wa s also observed for 
several elements in the tall column and Ellenbrook field trials, although calcium, sulfate, 
barium and aluminium concentrations did  not vary to the sa me de gree at higher L/S values.  
• LeachXS predicted  substantial sens itivity of leachate concentrations for elements of more 
than one common redox state with adopted pE values.  Under moderately oxic conditions, 
elements including manganese , vanadium and chro mium are predicted to leach at 
concentrations pre senting very low risk to the environm ent.  However, concentrat ions of 
manganese in particular is predicted to increase under more reducing conditions (pE <6) and 
also at low pH (pH <5 ). 
• LeachXS under -estimat es th e available contents of calcium and sulfur ( as gypsum), mainl y as 
a consequence o f the L/S ratio of 10 L/kg used in the LEAF Method 1313 test.  The available 
contents of calcium and sulfur were calculated as 19,000 mg/kg (1.9%) and 19,000 mg/kg 
(1.9%) , res pectively.  In actual fact, almost all of th e total concentra tions of calcium (15 .1%, 
Table 8) and sulfur (10.9%, Table 8) is present as gypsum, meaning the available contents 
may be under -estimated by more than 600%.  This would ha ve significant impl icati on for 
LeachXS predictive modelling, particu larly the leachin g characteristics of  calcium and sulfur, 
as well as other constituents with leaching characteristics dependent on alkalinity and ionic 
strength.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
115 5.4 Bauxite Residu e By-products 
5.4.1    Example 2: How LEAF Can Be Used to Assess a By -product  - Alkaloam  
5.4.1.1 By -product Alkaloam  Characterisation  
Alcoa’s refiner ies process bauxite ore from several deposits in the darling range.  Alumina, and other 
constituents of bau xite or e are ext racte d by the Bayer Process, which involves extra ction of finely 
ground ore with sodiu m hydroxide solution at elevated temperature and pressure.  The resulting 
fluid is filtered, with the solid residue referred to as “red mud”  remaining to be pote ntially r e-used 
or stored in residue drying beds . The fil trate, containing sodium aluminate an d other soluble 
constituents is crystallised to produce aluminium hydroxide  (Al(OH) 3), which is the n calcined to form 
alumina (Al 2O3). The Alkaloam sample  provide d by Alc oa contains less free alkalinity than  freshly 
produced  “red mud” as a consequence of p artial neutralisation with carbon dioxide.  
The principal constituents of Alkaloam are primar ily iron oxides (goethite and hematite), residual 
and secondar y alumin ium oxid es (gibbsite, boehmite ), quartz and alkali insolu ble oxides of titanium 
and vanadium. Several mixed CaO -Al2O3 phases, and zeolite minerals (such as sodalite) a re formed 
as secondary minerals. Table 16 presents the results for elemental anal ysis of the samp le of 
Alkaloam  provided for this project.  Note: the limit of reporting (LOR) values i n Table 16 are for XRF 
and/or ICP/AES analysis (section 4.4).  
Conditions of the Bayer Process also result in substantial alteration of organic materials p resent i n 
ore. O rganic forms of sulfur and phosphorus are convert ed to sulfate and phosphate respectiv ely, 
will humic substances are degraded to lower molecular form s including fulvic acids and short -chain 
carboxylic acids (succinic, acetic and oxalate).

5.4.1.2.1 LE AF  1313 Test  
Results for analysis of Alkaloam  are presented as graphs i n Appendix A5 -1.  Characteristics of the pH 
depen dent lea ching characteristics by analyte for th is materia l are summarised as follows : 
• Silver:  Silver  concentrations were extremely low (close to the LOR) and did not vary with pH.  
• Aluminium:  Indicated ch aracteristic amphoteric behaviour for alumi nium, wi th eleva ted 
concentrations at both very low and very high  pH values. The pH value for minimum 
solubility was between pH 7 and 8.  The maximum concentration available for leaching was 
at pH 2.  
• Arsenic: Generally, the highest concentrations were reco rded at the high er pH values, 
although solubility at low pH (2 an d 4 units) was higher than those at c ircum -neutral values.  
The solubility minima were between pH 5 and 7. 
• Boron:  Boron concentrations indicated ve ry little dependence with leachate pH.   
• Barium:  L eachate concentrations were typically <0.01 mg/L at pH va lues above 7.  Highest 
concentration recorded of approximately 1 mg/L at pH 2.  
• Beryllium:  Concentrations of extractable beryllium were very low (0. 0001 mg/L) at pH 
values above 6 but  increas ing with  increas ing acidity below pH 6 (Approximately 0.01 mg/L 
at pH 2 ). 
• Calcium:  Concentrations were  elevated (1,000 to 5,000 mg/L) and consistent at pH values 
below 6 pH units, but then decreased with increasin g pH to <1 mg/L at 13 pH units.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
117 • Cadmium:  Slightly elevated  concentrations (approximately 0.001 mg/L) were r ecord in 
strongly acidic leachates (p H 2 and 4), with much lower concentrations (including below 
method reporting limits) between pH 5 and 13.  
• Cobal t:  Cobalt concentrations  were <0.02 mg/L  at pH 2 . Much lo wer concentrations 
(<0.000 4 mg/L) were recorded i n alkaline leachates (pH >8) . 
• Chromiu m:  Elevated chromium concentrations (>0.1 mg/L) were recorded at both very low 
and very  high pH values.  Much lower concentrations (approximately 0.001 m g/L) were 
record ed for leachates with pH values between 6 and 8.  
• DOC:  Very high concentrations  (appro ximately 100 mg/L) of DOC were recorded with very 
little pH dependence.   
• Copper:  Copper leachates indicated c haracteristic amphoteric behaviour,  and t he pH 
mini mum  for copper solubility was approximately at 6 pH units . 
• Fluoride:  Fluoride concentrations were low (approximately 0.00 1 mg/L) between 6 and 8 pH 
units but  increasing significantly (to >10 mg/L) at both  very low and very high pH values.   
• Iron:  High ir on conce ntration s were evident  between 2 and 4 pH units, but much lower 
concentrations between  6 and  9 pH units, before increasing again at very high pH (>12 pH 
units).  
• Mercury:  Apart from minor anomalous  concentrations between 0.0001 and 0.001 mg /L, 
most  mercury  concentrations were <0.00001 mg/L across the pH range.  
• Potassium:  Potassium concentr ations  were consistent (approximately 1 – 2 mg/L) for  pH 
values below 8.  Higher concentrations at pH >8 were a n analytical artefact arising from use 
of KOH to ad just lea chate alkalinity.  
• Magnesium :  Magnesium leaching characteristics were simi lar to those  described earlier for 
calcium, i.e. maximum solubility at low pH, with concentrations decreasing with increasi ng 
leachate alkalinity (to <0.0 1 mg/L at pH  >10). 
• Manganese :  Leachate concentrations decreas es with increas ing pH. Concentrations in 
leachates were about 1mg/L at pH 2 and much lower at pH  > 6. 
• Molybdenum :  Leachate concentrations were very low at low pH but increased with 
increasing pH at values greater than 6.   
• Sodium :  As expected for a conservat ive ion suc h as sodium, leachate concentrations did not 
vary with pH.  Elevated concentrations (usually >1,000 mg/L) were recorded .  
• Nickel :  Low values (<0.1 mg/L) were recorded particularly in alk aline leacha tes. 
• Phosphorus : Phosphorus concentrations were very low (>0.01 mg/L) in leachates between 6 
and 9 pH units but  increased at both very low and very high pH values.  
• Lead :  Elevated (>0.01 mg/L) concentratio ns of lead were  recorded in pH 2 leachates . 
Concent rations in circum -neutral and alkaline leachates were bel ow the reporting limit 
(<0.00001 mg/L ). 
• Sulfur :  Sulfur concentrations were low. 
• Antimony : Leachates contained dissolved antimony at concentrations b etween 0.0001 and 
0.001 mg/L between pH va lues 8 a nd 11. 
• Selenium : Selenium concentrations increased with i ncreasi ng pH; from approximately 0.1 
mg/L at pH 4 to 0.5 mg/L at pH 13.    By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
118 • Silicon : Silicon  concentrations in leachates were highly pH dependent, rang ing from almost 
1,000 mg/L at pH 2 to 1 mg /L at pH  9 to 11 .   
• Tin:  Tin concentrations were at or be low the  method reporting limit.  
• Titanium : The highest titanium concentrations (maximum 1 mg/L) were recorded in acid 
leachates . Solubility of titanium mine rals were lowest (0.0001 to 0.001 mg/L) bet wee n pH7  
and 9. 
• Thallium : Thallium concentrat ions in all leachate s were below the method reporting lim it 
(0.0001 mg/L)  
• Uranium : Uranium concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 0.2 mg/L in leachates between pH 4 
and 11. Slightly higher concentrations were observe d at ver y low pH , while lower 
conce ntrations were observed at hig h pH >11.  
• Vanadium : Vanadium exhibite d amphoteric behaviour, with elevated concentrations (up to 
10 mg/L) in strongly acidic and strongly alkaline leachates .   
• Zinc: Elevated concentration (0 .1 to 0. 3 m g/L) of zinc  were noted in pH 2 leachates . 
Concentrati ons decreased with increasing pH . 
Results from the LEAF Method 1313 were used to identify constituents of potential concern (CoPC) 
in Alkaloam base d on methodology discussed  in a document pub lished b y the US -EPA in October 
2017.  This methodology is based on LEAF test results for:  
• The Availab le Content, defined as the maximum concentration  available for leaching 
which is  at end -point eluate pH values  of 2, 9 and 13 . 
• The maxim um eluate concentr ation ov er the d efined “applicable scenario pH 
domain”. For hypot hetical application of Alkaloam  as a soil amendment of Swan 
Coastal Plain sandy soils, the applicable scenario pH domain  was considered to be 5.5 
to 9.0 pH units.  
The adopt ed methodology is s umm arise d as follows:  
• Calculate the leachate concentrations based  on: 
▪ Available Content  (mg/kg) or;  
▪ Applicable scenario pH domain (mg/kg);  
▪ L/S ratio of 10 (for Method 1313);  
▪ Dilution and Attenuation Factor (DAF)  of 10, which accounts for  reduced 
concentrat ions bet wee n the  leachate source (i.e leaching from Alkaloam ) 
and the point of compliance in the recei ving environment (which may be 
down -gradient groundwater or a surface waterbody, depending on 
location); and  
▪ Upper and lower threshold constituent values listed i n Table 6, for 
assessment of soil leachate concentrations  from the tall column study 
(Section 5.2.4)  
 
Analytes where all concentrations were below the “lower threshold” values listed in Table  6 have 
very  low potential for enviro nmental impact. All oth er an alytes may warrant further investigation 
(Table 17), so me of these are discussed below.    By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
119 It is important to note that this approach to risk screening is based on that used in Europe and 
elsewhere mainly for materi als stored as waste, and not for benef icial re-use as  soil amendment 
products. Factors such as int ended application rates (typically 20  to 50 t/ha) and interaction of 
product constituents with soil (both mobilisation and attenuation) have not bee n consider ed.  In 
effect, this method provi des a  first pass, high level assessment of constituents of potent ial concern 
that require further eval uation, as discussed in subsequent sections.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

Based on these results  (Table 17), Alkaloam constituents of potential concern  under typical soil pH 
conditions (5 .5 to 9 pH units) are summarise d as follows:  
• Aluminium . 
• Chromium . 
• Copper, a lthou gh po tential risks are mitigated at DAF >10.  
• Molybdenum, particularly under alkaline conditions.  
• Selenium,  particularly under alkaline conditions.  
• Uranium.  
Note that many constituents of  potential concern identified on the basis of Available Content of 
Alkaloa m w ere no longer of concern  within the Applicable Scenario pH Domain Range (pH 5.5 to 9) 
as a consequence of reduced solubility and applicable to a DAF = 10.  LEAF 1313 results for t hese 
constituents (aluminium,  copper, chrom ium, fluoride (alkali ne pH ), mo lybdenum, selenium, 
uranium ) are presented in Figure s 39 and 40.

123 5.4.1.2.2 LEAF Test Results, Methods 1314 and  1316, L/S Dep endence  
Results for analys is of  by-products ( Alkaloam ) using method 1314 (up -flow percolation) are 
presented as char ts in Appendix A6 -1.  Corresponding results using method 1316 (batch 
equilibration) are presente d in Appendix A7 -1. 
For most analytes presen t in measurable conc entrat ions,  leachate concentrations usually decrease 
with increasing L/S ratio.   
The other type  of le achate behaviour occurs in the presence of sparingly soluble mineral phases, 
which form sa turated solutions containing comparable anal yte concentrations a t all L/S r atios.   
Results presented in Appendix A6 -1 indicate typically leachate concentration s betw een these two 
types of solute behaviour.  Analytes indicating predominantly ‘conservative ion’ behaviour include 
bromide, chloride, so dium and potassium . Analyt es in dicating predominantly ‘sparingly soluble 
mineral phase’  behav iour include  aluminium, barium, silicon, fluoride and calcium.  
Many analytes demonstrate b ehaviour between these type extremes. This behaviour is likely t o 
occur w hen oth er processes affect  solute behaviour, such as:  
• Ion exchan ge reactions, particularly wi th clay and humic phases.  
• Surfac e adsorption to variably charged amorphous mineral phases such, especially hydrous 
ferric, aluminium and manganese oxides  (collecti vely re ferred to as “hydro us fe rric oxides – 
HFO”) . 
• Changes in l eachate pH in response to inc reasing L/S ratio.  
• Changes in io nic strength (salinity) of leachate, which decreases with increasing L/S of 
materials containing significant amounts of so luble sal ts. 
• Changes in leachate co ncent rations of solutes capable of for ming stable complexes with 
metal ions as a function of L/S, e specially dissolved organic carbon, and also ions includin g 
fluoride, sulfate and phosphate.

• pH dependence (Met hod 1313)  leacha te analysis data.  
• The re lationship between leachate pH a nd the amount of acid or alkal i added, i.e. the 
material’s pH titration curve.  
• Dissolved humic acid (DHA) content in ea ch leachate, which is calculated as a fraction of 
dissolved organ ic carbon  (typic ally 20% to 40%).  DHA h as the capacity to form soluble 
complexes with many transition  metals, notably copper, cadmium , nickel and lead.  
• Clay content (mg/kg).  Clay minerals h ave a net negative charge, which results on solid phase 
interacti ons with cationi c species.   Clay co ntent  is not easily meas ured in materials such as 
Alkaloam using me thods developed for characterisa tion of soils because of a tendency for 
some particles, i ncluding secondary minerals such as zeolites, to flocculate durin g the 
mea suremen t step.  The value used for LeachXS (p resented in Table 18) was that used in 
earlier a ssessments of bauxite residues b y Alcoa.  
• Hydrous ferric oxide (HFO). These materials, whi ch include hydrous aluminium and 
manganese oxides, have very high  surface areas a nd variable surface  char ge (which is p H 
dependent). They can therefore retain anionic species by surface adsorption at  low pH and 
cationic species by surface adsorption at hig h pH.  The value used for LeachXS (presented in 
Table 18) was tha t used in  earlie r assessments of ba uxite  residues by A lcoa.  
• Solid Humic Acid.  The value used for Leac hXS (presented in Table 18) was that used in 
earlier assessments of bauxite residues by A lcoa.  As discussed in Section 5.4.1.1, the 
conditions  of the Bay er Proces s extra ction step results in su bstantial alternation of soil 
organic matter present in bauxit e ore.  
• A thermodynamic database containing data for oxide, carbonate, silicate, sulfide a nd DHA 
mineral phases of potentially  environmentally significant metals an d metal loids. Minteq 
versi on 4 was used as the thermodynamic database for this study.  
• Initial  pH and pE (redox potential) val ues.  The pE values were estimated from a “rule of 
thumb”  relationship  (Equation 1)20 applied  for LeachXS modelling in the  absence of reli able 
experimental d ata.

The LeachXS chemical speciatio n fingerpri nt for aluminium is presented in Figur e 41.  These results 
are used to describe the key co mponents of LeachXS prediction s, and overview of the mineral 
phases that have bee n identified by the model to explain the e xperimental pH and L/S dependen ce 
of aluminium solubility . 
The first chart in Figure 41 (left) comprises:  
Experimental data for the pH dependent dissolution of alu minium using Method 1313, shown as red 
dots.  
• Predi cted leachate concentrations in leachate w ith L/S  = 0.4 (noting that the “r ed dots” 
represent L/S = 10 leachates).  This pr edicted relationship is indicated by a green dashed 
curve.  These values may be con sidered as indicative of “porewater” or “first flu sh” leachate 
adjusted for different  pH val ues. 
• Predicted leachate concentra tions in leachate with L/S = 10. This predicted relationship is 
indicated by a red dashed curve. The se values may be considered as indicative of long -term  
neat seepage (adjusted for  different p H values ) or diluted first flu sh seepage leachate in the 
receiv ing environment. Coincidence of the L/S = 0.4 an d L/S = 10 curve is indicative of 
concentration cont rol by sparingly soluble minera l phases, while significant deviation is 
indicativ e of conserva tive ion behaviour. For analy te behaviour exclusively as a con servative 
species, the two curves will be displa ced by a common factor of 25 . 
The accuracy of LeachX S chemical speciation fingerpri nts was found to be highly variable.  A “good 
fit” is indicated  by near coincidence of the e xperimental data (red dots) and t he predicted curve 
fitted to L/S =10.  The fit f or aluminium in Figure 39 is considered a reasonable  fit, particularly for 
acidic a nd circum -neutral pH values, although predicted co ncentrations in the alkaline pH range may 
be an order of magnitude lower th an experiment values.  
In general, the accuracy o f chemical speciation fingerprints for a specific an alyte depends on:  
• The abundance  of the element in the material.  Predictions for major component elements 
such as aluminium , silicon, calcium, magnesium and  iron (which are typically present in 
percent le vels) are generally much more accurate than those fo r elements predict ed as trace 
components (mg/kg or less) ; 
• The number of mineral p hases in the database. Common elements suc h as aluminium, 
silicon, calcium,  magnesium, copper, manganese and zinc are cover ed by at least six mineral 
phases in the Minteq data base ; 
• Whether or not the minera ls in the database cover the assemblage of mineral s stable across 
the full pH range of Metho d 1313 (2 to 13 pH units). Some e lements include mineral oxide 
and hydroxide phas es that are only stable in alkaline solution with a paucity of phases stable 
under acidic conditions ;  
• The availability and quality  of thermodynamic data for each mineral phas e in the database ; 
and 
• The limita tions of LeachXS in accounting for  the competiti ve adsorption effects of cations 
and organics .

128 The second chart in Figure 41 (on t he right) presents the predicted concentrations, o n a volumetric 
basis at L/S = 10, of vario us mineral and solution phases.  The concentrations (y -axis) are usually 
presente d with a logarithmic scale, which requires careful i nterpretation of the predicted results.  
Liquid phases components comprise:  
• “Free”  or dissolved inorganic ions. Note that Le achXS does not indicate relative proportions 
of these ions in different oxidation  states (e.g. Fe2+ and Fe3+), or those present as 
coordination complexes or ion pai rs (e.g. AlF2+, CaSO 4, MgHCO 3+); and  
• “DOC bound”, which refers to ions covalently complexed with dissolved organic carbon 
com pounds.  
 
Solid phases components comprise:  
• Analy tes associated with particulate organic matter (POM) ; 
• Analytes bound to clay minera ls as by ion -exchange reactions ; 
• Analytes bound to  amorphous hydrous ferric, aluminium and m anganese oxide surface, 
designate d as the “FeOxide” phase ; and  
• Crystalline minera l phases included in the mineral database used in Le achXS modelling  
 
Note that the total mass of analyte presented in each LeachXS ch art corresponds to the maximum 
amount of l eachable analyte (referred to as the “Available Content”) from the pH dependence test 
(Method 1313), typically that present in pH 2 o r pH 13 leachates.  Thus, subst antial amounts of 
major elements present as insolu ble primary minerals are not accounted for  in LeachXS modelling 
i.e. there is no relationship between “Available Content” a nd results from “total” elemental 
composition analys es. The amount of constituent r emaining in the soil post leaching (i.e. total 
concentration minus “available content”) is o f no environmental concern as it is not bio -available 
within the pH range of 2 to  13.  In effect, it may be consider ed as contributin g to the “ambient 
background co ncentration” under NEPM/DWER Contaminated Site ass essment guidelines . 
Conclusions provided b y assessment of the phase apporti onment diagram presented as the second 
chart in Figure 41 indicates the following characteristics of  “Available” aluminium in Alkal oam:  
• All of the “available” aluminium at pH values  less than 3.5 is present as “free alumini um”.  
Although not available from  LeachXS output data, the most likely ions inclu de [Al(H 2O)6]3+ 
and [Al(H 2O)5OH]2+; 
• The concentratio n of free aluminium decreases a s pH increases from 3.5 to 7 pH units, 
mainly as a  result of precipitation of the hydroxide mineral gibbsite, Al(OH) 3; 
• The lo west concentration of “free” aluminium, approxim ately 0.001 mg/L in L/S = 10 
leachate, occurs at pH 7.0; 
• The lowest concentration o f “dissolved” aluminium is observed within the pH range of 5.5 to 
8 at a concentration of ap proximately 0.01 mg/L, comprising  DOC -bound (major) and “free” 
(minor) forms ; 
• The solid phase includes a small proportion of POM -boun d aluminium, but only within a pH 
range of 5.5 to 9.5 ;  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
129 • Gibbsite is the dominant s olid phase component  present at pH values above 9.5 pH units ; 
and 
• The pro portion of aluminium reporting to the solution phase increases with increasing pH 
above 8 pH units. At  pH 15, approximately 10% of “a vailable” aluminium partitions to the 
solution pha se (at L/S = 10). Although not predicted b y LeachXS, the dominant form of  
soluble aluminium at high pH is likely to be the anionic form, [Al(OH) 4]-.

5.4.1.3  LeachXS Predictive Modelling - Virtual Material and Column Simula tion 
LeachXS includes a flexible set of laboratory test and field simulation model scenarios that can be 
used for parameter estimatio n (laboratory test simulations) and evaluating lea ching under a variety 
of field conditions (prediction scenarios). In gene ral, the user can adjust the material characteristics, 
initial conditions and boundary conditions for within each scenario.  
The predi cted chemical speciation fingerprints of soils and  by-product amendment materials, and 
perco lation parameters may be used t o evaluate the results of percolation column tests using a 
conceptual model comprising mobile and immo bile zones. The conceptual mode l (Figure 17) consists  
of two zones segmented alon g the flow path, with one zone containing a mobile fluid phase in local 
equilibrium with the solid phase and the second zone containing an immobile fluid phase in local 
equili brium with the solid phase. Wit hin each column segment, each of the mobile and im mobile 
zones are well mixed (i.e. uniform distribution of constituents wi thin each of the solid phase and 
liquid phase orthogonal to the flow direction), and the mobile and im mobile zones exchange 
dissolved  constituents based on mass transfer coefficients that can be considered an effective 
diffus ion distance. This model is ins ensitive to percolation flow rate because homogeneity within the 
immobile zone is assumed. This model can be used for a first -order a pproximation of the effects of 
preferential flow i n a percolation system, as well as the imp acts of changes in redo potenti al and 
influent solution chemistry on the leaching of constituents.  
In order for LeachXS to predict le aching characteristics of amend ed soils, the concept of a “virtual 
material” was developed. For the purpose of this project , a “virtual material” may be c onsidered as a 
representation of a blend of a by-product  with a sandy soil in a ratio equivalent to ty pical field  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
130 application rates. Typically, this is  5% by mass which is approximat ely equivalent to 30 to 50 tonnes 
per hect are of dry material applied to soil and mixed by incorporating to a depth of 100 mm.  
LeachXS has a capability for generating chemical  speciation fingerprints of a v irtual material 
(amended soil layer) by combining the chemical speciation fingerprints of ea ch component at the 
assigned mi xing ratio. While there is sufficient LEAF test data and LeachXS chemical special 
fingerprints availab le to generate virtual material s for all combinations of by -products and the four  
soil types selected for this study, the f ollowing discussion relates to the following combinations:  
• Alkaloam blended with Bassendean Ellenbrook soil ( 5% by weight).  
5.4.1.3.1  Alkaloam  and Bassendean E llenb rook Soil Blend  
Predicted chemical speciation fing erprints for the virtual material comprisi ng a blend of Alkaloam 
(5% by w eight) with Bassendean Ellenbrook sand are presented in Appendix A10 -1. For many 
analytes, the chemica l speciation fingerprints are m ainly influenced by the Bassendean Ellenbrook 
sand  component.  Exceptions arise in the case of analytes that are a major co mponent of Alkaloam 
and a minor component of the soil – as indicated in Figure 42 for iron and Figure 43 for aluminium.  
Ferrihydrite  is predicted to be a major solid phase component in Alkaloam and a minor component  
in Basse ndean Ellenbrook sand (where PO M-bound is dominant, which is typical of podzol soil 
types).  Ferrihydrite is the dominant solid phase  component in the blended soil.  
Similarly, gibbsite (Al (OH) 3) was predicted to b e the dominant solid phase form of alumini um in 
Alkaloam at pH values gre ater than 4, but was not predicted to be present in Bassendean Ellenbrook 
sand – in which POM -bound al uminium was the dominant solid phase component at the soil’s 
natural pH (acidic p H). Gibbsite with minor POM -bound aluminiu m were the main solid phase 
compo nents predicted by LeachXS for  the soil blend .  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

133 5.4.1.4  Laborat ory and Field data  
5.4.1. 4.1 Tall Column E xper iment  
As discussed in Section  4.10.2,  a large column experiment was set up as follows:  
A surface layer of either  amended soil (us ing Alkaloam  as amendment) was applied at the 
application rate equivalents to 50 t/ha/10 cm layer for the soil amendment ma terials.  
Leachates were collected  on three occasions, as summarised in Section 4. 10.2.1 (designated as Time 
1, 2 and  3). 
At each samp ling event, leachates were coll ected from:  
• Immediately below the amended soil/mat erial layer;  
• Draining the  tap at the base of the column prior to flushing, i.e. sampling interstitial 
water from soil voids from the initial setting up of the  column and subse quent 
leaching events; and  
• Collecting leachate from the base of the column after the flushing event descri bed in 
Section 4. 10.2.1.  
 
Results for analysis of the leachates are tabulated in Table A1 -1 of Appendix A11.   In addition, results 
for all analytes ar e plotted as charts presented i n Appendix 12.   Each chart shows the concentration s 
for the specific analyt e and soil type f rom the three leachate sampling p oints collected on three 
occasions (coloured lines and markers), with the correspon ding results from  the “control” columns 
(i.e. no  amended soil and residue material cover layer) as  black dashed lines (no m arkers).  
Analytes  where all concentrations were below the “lower threshold” values listed in Table  6 have 
very low potential  for envi ronmental impact.   All other analytes may warran t further investigation 
(Table 20), some of these are discussed below.   
In many cases, it is  observed that the leachate conce ntrations from the flushing of the column are 
controlled mainly by the soil materia l rather than the  amendment mater ial.  Exception s to this 
general observation are discussed in gre ater detail in the following sections.  
Potential for mobilisation of specif ic constituent s from Alkaloam  
Based on the tall column experiment, key potential constituent s from s oils amended wit h Alkaloam 
include:  
• Aluminium, noting that a substantial proporti on of leachable aluminium is predicted to be in 
low toxicity forms associat ed with DOC and other constituents;  
• Copper, zinc and chromium, which includes subst antial contributi ons from the soi l rather than 
Alkaloam; and  
• Phosphorus .  Although Alkaloam has be en identified as a  potentially  effective m eans of 
reducing phosphorus leach ing from sandy soils, elevated concentrations were recorded in 
leachates from the t all column experi ments.  However , it is to be no ted that the “subsoil” 
layer in the tall column ex periment was actually topsoil containing e levated concentrations of 
labile phosphorus.  In field situations, the natural subsoils would be expected to contain  much 
lower conce ntrations of po tentially labile  phosphorus.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

135 5.4.1.4.2  Field Data  
5.4.1.4.2 .1 Alkaloam  Ellenbrook  Trial 
A trial was e stablished in 2011 on Department of Defence land to assess the effectiveness Alkaloam. 
Alkaloam was  applied to leach ing sandy soils o f the Ellenbrook c atchment to assess their suitability 
for use to retain ph osphor us (P) on cropping land.  Three lysimeters were installed within nine 3 x 3 
metre small plots to collect leachate from soil over different rain events during w inter and spring 
from 2011 to 2017.  Initially depth wise (0 -10 cm, 10 -20 cm, 20 -30 cm and 30 -40 cm ) soil sampling 
was cond ucted to assess th e nutrient and metals movement do wn the profile and later only topsoil 
samples were analysed.  
Results from analyses of lysimeter leac hates sampled on 2 0 occasions between June 2012 and June 
2017 are presented  in Appendix A 14.  A summary of key findings is  presented as a risk profile tabl e 
(Table 21) using the same analyte threshold concentration presented in Table 6 for the tall column  
experiment.  Risk  profiles are presented for “short term” (end of 2012) an d “lon g term” (2017) 
leachates . 
Comparison of th e risk profile of Alkaloam from t he Ellenbrook trial (Table 19) with that of the tall 
column laboratory trial (Table  20, Section 5. 4.1.4.1 ) indicate  that the “short term” potential risks are 
comparable (notin g that  zinc did not present as  a potential  risk from the Ellenbrook trial).  With  the 
exceptions of minor potential risks from chromium and copper (some of which is present in 
Ellen brook soil) , the p otential risk associated with the remaining elements decrease t o very low.

137 5.4.1.5  LeachXS Solute Transport Modelling – Comparison with Field and Laborat ory C olumn 
Leaching Data  
5.4.1.5.1  Model Cond itions  
The predictive percolation co lumn solute transport module of Le achXS wa s used to simulate lea ching 
chara cteristics for the f ollowing scenarios:  
• A blended layer of 10 cm of 5% Alkaloam and Bassendean Ellen brook  sand overlying a 90 cm 
layer of Bassendean Ellenbrook sand.  
These scenarios  were designed to reflect the cond itions o f the tall column leac hing experi ment 
(Section 4.10.1 .1) and in the case of Alkaloam, the highest application rates of the Ellenbrook  field 
trial (Section 4.10.2), noting  that the materials were applied as a surfac e layer and not incorporated 
by mi xing in the topsoil layer.   
Note that the  field rainfall reco rds cannot be used to relate the lysimeters leachate concentrations 
at Ellenbroo k to a specific L/S ratio. Although an estimate  of  the cumulative volume of inc ident 
rainfall can be derived from  Bureau of Meteorology records , there is n o information on  the 
percentage of that rainwater reporting to the lysimeter – known as the Net Per colati on (NP).  NP will 
vary with each rainfall event as a consequence of the var iable amount of incident rainfall returned  to 
the atmosphere via  evapotransp iration (or less li kely, surface run -off).  For a very intense event, NP 
may be very high (>90%).  For a very light shower, or extended drizzle, NP may be very low (<20%).  
In addi tion to the chemical speciation fi ngerprin ts for each materi al, including the  virtual materials  
representing the 5% blends of Alkaloam with Bassendean Ellenbrook sand, LeachXS  also r equires 
model input parameters for:  
• Column density ; 
• Column diameter ; 
• Numbe r of “cells” ; 
• Column length ; 
• Colum n mobile  fraction ; 
• Phase d istance ; 
• Column p orosity ; 
• Permeatin g solution ; and  
• Out of column flow rate.  
 
Values for model input parameters for the thr ee modelled scenarios are presented in Table 22. For  
several parameters re lating to the hydraulic characteri stics of  the materials, no minal values were  
used rather than measured values. the nominal values adopted were considered to be indicative of 
free dr aining sandy materials on the Swan Coastal Plain.  The addition of the by -products in the 
blended soil ( IMG ) was ass umed not to alter the hydraulic cha racteristics of th e soil (Bassendean 
Ellenbrook).   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

Leac hXS per colation output results were presented in four charts formats, from which bottom of 
column leachate concent rations c ould be calculate d for each scenari o and subsequentl y compared 
with field trial data and tall column laboratory leachate data (Sectio n 5.4.1.4).  Examples  of these 
formats, using aluminium in the virtual column of 5% Alkaloam blended with Bassende an Ellenb rook 
sand (2 cell s, 10 cm depth) ov er Bassendean Ell enbrook sand (18 cells, 10 -100 cm) are presented in 
Figures 4 4 and 4 5.  Interpre tations  of the predicted results are discussed thereafter.  
Figure 4 4 presents  the volumetric concentrations of spe cific liquid  and solid phas es, on a whole 
column volumetric ba sis, for aluminium at an L/S = 0.397 as a function of column depth. Key points 
provided  by presentation of modelled data in this format are:  
• The volumetric concen tration of “available content” al uminium i n the first two c ells is 
approximat ely 50,000  mg/L, most of which is associated with Alkaloam  in the blended soil 
layer.  
• The volumetr ic con centration of “available content” aluminium in the underlying cells is 
appr oximately 150 mg/L, corresponding  to the o riginal concentra tion in Bassendean  
Ellenbrook sand.   This indicates there has been very little mass transfer of aluminium from the 
amended  soil layer to the underlying soil layer.  
• The dominant form of aluminium in  both layers is predicted to be t he feldsp ar mineral albite , 
with additional aluminium hydroxi de in the amended  soil layer.  Both layers, but particularly 
the amended soil lay er, we re also predicted to contain a hydrotalcite phase 
(Mg 6Al2CO 3(OH) 16·4(H 2O). 
• The concentration of solution pha se alumin ium (DOC -bound + free), but express ed on a 
column vo lumetric basis rather than a solution phase volumetric basis, increases slightly  
below the amended soil layer.

140 Figure 4 5 prese nts the v olumetric  concentrations of specifi c soluble  and sol id phases, on a whole 
column volumetric basis, for aluminium at the 100 cm layer (base of column) as a function of L/S, 
effectively providing predicted informatio n relating to “out of column” lea chate com positio n as 
function of leachate vo lume. Key points provided by presentation of modelled data in this format 
are: 
• The model output ma inly d epends on the validity of mobile fraction and effective phase 
distance used  in the model. The solution conce ntration will de crease with the increase in 
mobile fraction. The pH dependent data for Al shows the effect of pH change under changing 
“exposu re” co nditions in case of solubility control. The change in L/S ratio from 0.2 to  0.5 
suggests an increase in pH v alues fro m 7.8 t o 8 and the soluble Al conce ntration increase d 
(Figure 4 5). This points at solubility control by the combination of phases con trolli ng Al 
solubility. The model describes washout of DOC, however the model doe s not take into 
account generatio n of new DOC, wh ich is likely under the long -term  test condit ions in the 
column study.  
• The “first flush” leachate concentration of approximate ly 0.0 2 mg/L aluminium (allowing for 
conversion of column volume to solution phas e volume), comprised of exclusive ly DOC -bound 
aluminium.  
As the solution phas e ratio increases , the concentration of soluble aluminium is predicted to 
decrease and contain inc reasin g proportion of free aluminium . 
The decrease in liquid phase aluminium is a ccompanied by proportional increa ses of  both kaolinite 
and POM -bound aluminiu m in the solid ph ase.

5.4.1.5.4  Comp arison M ethodology  
Predicted end o f colu mn leachate concentrations from LeachXS modelling described in Section 
5.4.1.5.1 were compared with results from f ield results (Ellenbrook trial for Alk aloam) and labora tory 
tall column leachate data using the following methodology:  
• Predicted end of column  leachate concentration (sum of DOC -bond and free fractions) as a 
function of L/S, as calculated from LeachX S outp ut data illustrated by Figure 44 (Sect ion 
5.4.1.5.2 ). 
• Tall column  bottom of column leachate concentrations for three sampling events (Le ach 
Number 1, 2 and 3) discussed in Section 4.10.2.1 . 
• Lysimeter leachate concentr ations from the first eight sampl ing ev ents from the Ellenbrook 
Trial (Sectio n 4.10.1.1)  for Alkaloam.

Charts comparing predicted end of colum n leac hate concentrations using LeachXS with Ellenbrook 
field trial leachate conc entrations and tall column labora tory l eachate concentrations for selected 
analytes are presen ted in Appendix A18.  
The following discussion focuses on the following analytes w hich w ere identified as constituent s of 
interest from assessment of the potential  risk profiles derived from inter pretat ion of LEAF test, tall 
column and fiel d trial results:  
• Aluminium;  
• Chromium;  
• Copper;  
• Phosphorus;  
• Selenium; and  
• Zinc.  
Aluminium  
Compariso n data  for aluminium leaching characteristics are presented in Figure 4 6. In the LeachXS 
prediction n o change in a lumini um concentration was noted below L/S r atio 0.1 (0.15 mg /L) but 
elevated aluminium concentration occurred from L/S ratio 0.1 to 0.35 to a  maxim um of 107 mg/L. A 
decreasing trend was noticed  for higher L/S ratios  follow ed by generally low end of tall c olumn 
aluminium concentrations, the latter b eing consistent w ith lower level of measured leachate 
concentrations from the tall column experime nt. Elevated aluminium concentration was observed in 
the field trial and tall col umn experiment but decrease d to lower leve ls over leaching events. Noting 
that a substantial p roportion of leachable aluminium is predicted to be in low toxicity forms 
associa ted wi th DOC and other constituents.

Chromium  
Comparison data for chromium leaching characteristics are presented in Figure 4 7. LeachXS 
predicted a “first -flush” event  of elevated chromium, follo wed by generally low end of  colum n 
chromiu m concentrations, the latter being  consistent with l ower level of measured leachate 
concentrations from the tall column experiment. E levate d concentrations measured in the 
Ellenbrook field trail , which indicated a minor potential risk which could be due to  a substantial 
contribution from so il rather than Al kaloam.  This potential risk would be considered as very low if 
speciation analysi s indi cated the chromium to be present in trivalent, rather than hexavalent, form s.  
LeachXS has the capabil ity to  apportio n soluble chromium between trivalen t and hexavalent forms 
(but was not undertaken for this study).

143 Copper  
Comparison  data for copper leaching character istics are presen ted in Figure 4 8. No free copper was 
observed in the LeachXS prediction which was  mainl y suggesting DOC association of copper.  Field 
trial indicated higher coppe r concentration initially a nd dec rease to very low  levels  which is similar 
to the tall column laboratory trial.  Both Ellenbrook field trial and laboratory tall column experim ent 
provided leachates with significantly higher concentrations of copper than th ose predicted by 
LeachXS.  Nevert heless , both LeachXS and laboratory trial results predict min or potential risk  from 
copper leaching (by comparison with irrigation and livesto ck dri nking water quality, Table 1,  which is 
in agreement with the field trial ov er a longer period.

Phosphorus  
Comparison data for phosphorus leaching characteristics are prese nted in  Figure 4 9. Although 
Alkaloam has be en identified as a  potentially effective means of re ducing phosphorus leaching from 
sandy soils, el evated concentrations were recorde d in l eachates from the tall column and field trial . 
However, it is to be note d that the “subsoil” layer in the tall column  experiment was actually topsoil 
contain elevated co ncentrations of labile phosphorus. In field situations, the natural subsoils woul d 
be e xpected to contain much lower concentrations of potentially labile phosp horus. 
LeachXS predicted an initial flush of leachate with very high phosphorus concentrations, w hich 
subsequently decreased after L/S = 1 L/kg to concentrations consistent with those from the 
laboratory tall column and Ellenbrook field trials.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

Comparison data for se lenium leaching characteristics are presente d in Figure 50. The selenium 
concentration predicted by LeachXS at L/S ra tio 1 L/kg or more is consistent wi th both field and  
experimental trial .  As with several other constituents of potential concern, Le achXS predicted 
elevated concentrations of seleniu m in firs t-flush (low L/S) leac hates.  Given  the volume of leachate 
expec ted by leaching at these low L/S va lues (approximate ly 0.3 L/kg), the predicted first -flush 
concentrations predicted by LeachX S could  not b e verified by the laboratory and field trial  data.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

generally very low  end of column zinc concentration which is  consistent with measured leachate

Elevated  concentration of zinc measured in the tall column e xperiment decreased wit h respect to 
leaching events. Note that th is elevated zinc concentration coul d be a substantia l contribution from 
the soil used in the tall column trial.

147 5.4.1.6  Summary  
Comp arison of laboratory LE AF Method 1313 results, LeachXS solute tra nsport modelli ng, tall 
column labor atory trials and the Ellenbrook field trial provides t he following key points with respect 
to Alka loam  by-product as a potential so il amendment : 
• LEAF Method 1 313 results identifie d aluminium, chromium , copper, molybdenum,  selenium 
and uranium as constituen ts of potential c oncern in Alkaloam  and would need fur ther 
investigation when assessing its applic ation in this scenario pH domain .  Fluoride was also 
indicat ed as a constituent o f potential concern at pH values at the hi gher end of th e 
applicable scenario  pH domain, corre sponding to instability of the minera l fluorite (CaF 2) 
under strongly alkaline co nditions.  
• With exception of copper, the identified co nstitue nts of potential conc ern are capable of 
forming stable oxy -anio ns, including Al(OH) 4-, CrO 42-, SeO 42-, MoO 42- and U O32-. Several oxy -
anions, notably tho se of chromium and uranium are only stable u nder strongly oxic (high pE) 
condition.  
• LeachXS provi ded sen sible chemical specia tion fingerprints for these constituents o f 
potential co ncern in Alkaloam .  The corresponding chemical speciation fingerprints of t hese 
elements, particularly the oxy -anion el ements , in Alkaloam  indicate major control of 
solubil ity by interaction with  hydr ous ferric oxides , rather than organic mat ter and discre te 
mineral phases .  Bassendean sand co ntain very little HFO, and so provide  very low potential 
for attenuation of these  elements should they leach from the amended soil lay er. 
• LeachXS predicted “first -flush” washout characteristics for most  elements, i.e. most of the 
leaching  occurred at low L /S ratios (less than 0.3).  This beha viour was also observed for 
some  elements in  the tall column and Ellenbrook field trials, but not  for the oxy -anion 
constitue nts of potential concern.  
• The elevated con centrations pr edicted in first -flush events in Leach XS are partly explained 
by: 
o The high permeability conditions adopted for the colu mn, which is consistent with the 
exceptional drainage  proper ties of Swan Coastal Plain soil types.  
o The inability of Bassend ean sand to at tenuate soluble oxy -anions as a conseq uence of 
very low HFO (and clay) cont ents.  
o A lack of thermodynamic data for key m ineral phases for these elements non -
represented in t he mine ral database used by LeachXS.  
o Mobilisation of constituents of t he lower, unam ended soil layer – either by mobilisat ion 
under the soil’s “natural” pH/EC conditions, or changes in porewater composit ion 
(especially pH, pE and DOC) by interaction with l eachate  from the amended soi l layer.

5.4.2.2.1 LEAF 1313 Test  
Results f or analysis of by-product  NRP are presented as graphs in Appendix A5 -2.  Characteristics of 
the pH depen dent leaching charact eristics by analyte for NRP  are summarised  as follows:  
• Silver:  Silver  concen tratio ns were ext remely  low (typically <0.0001 mg/L) and did not vary 
with pH.  
• Aluminium: Characte ristic amphoteric behaviour was observed for aluminium, with  elevated 
concentration s at both v ery low and very high pH values. The pH va lue for minimum 
solubi lity was between 7 and 8 pH un its.  Maximum concentrat ions were approximately 500 
mg/L at pH 2, and 200 mg/L at  pH 13.  
• Arsenic: In generally, the highest conc entrations were recorde d at the hi gher pH values, 
although solubility at low  pH (2 and 4 units) wa s higher than those  at circum -neutral values.  
The sol ubility minima were between 6 and 7 pH units.   The maximu m concentration was 
approximately 0.3 mg/L at p H 13.  
• Boron:  Leachate boron concen trations were very low (maximum 0.08 mg/L)  and decreased 
(to <0. 001 mg/L) with incr easing  pH. 
• Barium: Leachate concent rations were typically <0.0 2 mg/L at leachate pH values a bove 8.  
The leachates showed  increasing barium  concentrations with de creasing pH . 
• Beryllium: Concentrations of extractable  beryllium were very l ow (0.0001 mg/L) at  pH values 
above 6  but increasing w ith increasing acidity below pH 6 (Approximately 0.01 mg/ L at pH 
2). 
• Calcium: Highest c oncentrations were noted at pH  2 (1,800 mg/L) and were cons tant 
between pH 4 -6 and pH 8-10 (at approximately 500 mg /L) but then decreased further  with 
increasing pH.   This behaviour is consistent with most of the calcium being  associa ted with a 
mixture of calcium carbonate  (or aluminates) and gy psum . 
• Cadmi um:  With exception of the pH 2 leachates,  concentrations of cad mium in leachate  
were very low  (<0.0005 mg/L , particul arly at circum -neutral pH . The maximum 
concentration (in pH 2 leachates) w as approximately 0.003 mg/L . 
• Cobalt: concentrations o f cobalt we re below the method reporting limit  (<0.00 01 mg/L) 
under circum -neutral  and slightly alkaline conditions. Slightly ele vated concentrations 
(maximum 0.006 mg/L) were recorded  in low pH (pH 2) leachates.  One of three replic ate 
samples also record ed slightly  elevated (0.004 mg/L) concentrations at v ery high pH (pH 13).  
• Chromiu m:  Elevated chromium co ncentrations (>0.1 mg/L)  were recorded at both very low  
and very high pH va lues. Much lower concentrations were recorded for lea chates with pH 
values b etween 6 an d 8, with the lowest value of approximatel y 0.0002 mg/L recorded  for 
NRP at approximately pH 7 . 
• DOC:  Leachates  contai ned relatively low concentrations (10 t o 15 mg/L)  of DOC .  
• Copper: Copper leachates indicated characteri stic amphoteric behavio ur. The pH minimum 
for copper solubility  (<0.01 mg/L)  was measured  at 6 pH units.   The maximu m 
concentrat ions were  approximately 0.08 mg/L in pH 2 leachates.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
150 • Fluoride:  Fluoride concentr ations were relatively low  (below the method re porting limit of 
10 mg/ L) between 6 and 8 pH units but  increasing significan tly (to approximately 40 mg/L)  at 
both v ery low and very high pH values.   
• Iron:  Iron concentration  were elevated  between 2 and 4 pH  units  (>10 mg/L) , but much 
lower concentration s between 6 and 9 pH un its, before  increasing again at very high pH (>12 
pH units) . 
• Mercury:  Apar t from minor anoma lous concent rations between 0.0001 a nd 0.001 mg/L, 
most mercury concentrations were <0.0001 m g/L across the pH range.  
• Potassium: Potassium c oncentrations were simi lar and con sistent (approximately 5 – 10 
mg/L) for pH  values below 8.  High er concentrations at pH >8 wer e an analytical artefact  
arising from use of KOH to adjust leachate alkalinity  (Section 4.6). 
• Magnesium : Magnesium leaching char acteristics were simila r to those described earlier for 
calcium, i.e. maximu m solubility at low pH  (30 mg/L) , with concentration s decreasing with 
increa sing leachate alkalinity (to <0. 2 mg/L at pH >10).  
• Mangan ese: Leachate concentrations decreas es with inc reasing pH .   
• Molybdenu m: Leachate  concentrations were very low  at low pH, b ut increased with 
increasing pH at values greater th an 6.  Maximum concentra tions of approximately 0.1 mg/L 
were recorded in pH 13 le achates.  
• Sodium :  As expected for a conservativ e ion such as sodium, l eachate con centrations did not 
vary with pH. Elevated  concentrations (usual ly >700 mg/L) were recorded .   
• Nickel : Very low  values  (<0.001 mg/L) were recorded in alkaline le achates (pH >8 ).  
Concentrations increased with decreasing pH  to a maximum value of 0.02 mg/L a t pH 2.  
• Phosphorus : Phosphorus concentrati ons were very low ( < 0.01 mg/L) in leachates  at pH >6, 
but elevated  phosphor us concentration noted (0.5 mg/L) at pH value 2.  
• Lead :  Elevated (>0.01 mg/L) concentrations of lead wer e only recorded in pH 2  leachates .  
Concentrations in circum -neutral and alk aline leachates were b elow the reporting limit 
(<0.0001 mg/L).  
• Sulfur : Sulfu r concentrations were approximately 700 -800 mg/L between 4 and 10 pH units, 
and slightly higher concentr ations at pH 2 and pH > 10.   
• Antim ony: Concentrations of antimony in leachat es were at or below th e limit of detection 
(<0.0001  mg/L) at all pH values.   
• Selenium : Selenium c oncentrations in  leachates were sli ghtly elevated (approximately 0.05 
mg/L)  and no t pH dependent.  
• Silicon :  Silicon  concentrations in leachates were highly pH  dependent, ranging fr om almost 
250 mg/L at pH 2 to  1 mg/L at pH 9 to 1 0.  Concentrations in leachates increased at higher 
pH values  about 25 -35 mg/L.  
• Tin: Tin concentrations were  at or below the method  reporting limit at all pH  values . 
• Titanium : The high est titanium concentra tions (maximum 3.3 mg/L) were recorded in acid 
leachat es. Solubility of titanium minerals were lowest (0.0001 to  0.001 mg/L) between pH  7 
and 9.  
• Thallium : Thallium concentrations in  all leachat es were below the method reporting limit 
(0.0001 mg/L)   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
151 • Uranium : Slightly elevated  concent ratio ns were observed at ver y low pH and they ranged 
from 0.05 to 0.4 mg/L between pH 2 and 4, while lower concentrations  (<0.01 mg/ L) were 
observed at hig h pH (>8).  
• Vanadium :  Vanadium exhibited amphoteric b ehaviour, with elevat ed concentrations (up to 
2.5 mg/L) in strongly acidic and strongly alkaline leachates .  Concentrations in leacha te with 
pH values between 5 and 10 were very l ow (typically <0.01 mg/ L), 
• Zinc: Elevated concentration ( 0.08  mg/L) of zinc were measured in pH 2  and above pH 12 
leachate s. Conc entration s decreased wi th increasing pH  from  4 to 12, with the solubility 
minima (typically  <0.01 mg/L) being between pH 8 and 10. 
 
Results from the L EAF Method 1 313 were used to identify constituents of potential concern (Co PC) 
in NRP  based  on methodology  discusse d in a documen t published by the US -EPA in October 2017.  
This methodolo gy is based on LEAF test results for:  
• The Avai lable Content, defined as the maxim um concentration at end -point eluate pH 
values of 2, 9 and 13 . 
• The maximum elua te concentratio n over th e defined “app licable scenario pH 
domain”.  For hypot hetical  application  of NRP  as a soil amendment of Swan Coastal 
Plain sandy soils, the applicable sce nario pH domain  was considered to be 5.5 t o 9.0 
pH units.  
 
The adopted methodol ogy is summaris ed as fol lows:  
• Calculat e the leachate concentrations based on:  
▪ Available Content  (mg/kg) or;  
▪ Applicable scenario pH domain (mg/ kg); 
▪ L/S ratio of 10 (f or Method 13 13); 
▪ Dilution and Attenuation Factor (DAF)  of 10, which account s for reduced 
concentrations be tween the  leachate sour ce (i.e leaching from NRP ) and 
the point of compliance in the receiving environment (which may be 
down -gradient groundwater or a surface wa terbody, depending on 
location); and  
▪ Upper  and lower threshold constituent valu es listed in Table 6, for 
assessment o f soil leachate concentrations from the tall column study

Analytes where all concentrat ions were below the “lo wer threshol d” values listed in Table  6 have 
very low  potential for environ mental impact.  All other ana lytes may  warrant further investigation 
(Table 24), some of these are discussed b elow .  
It is important to note that this approach  to risk screening is b ased on t hat used in Europe and 
elsewhere mainly fo r materials stored as waste, and not for beneficial re-use as soil amendment 
products. Factors such as intended application rates (ty pically 20 to 50 t/ha) and interaction of 
product  constituents with soil  (both mo bilisation and attenuation) have not been considered.  In  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

Based on these results, NRP co nstituents of potential conce rn under typical soil pH conditions (5 .5 to 
9 pH units ) are sum marise d as follows:  
• Aluminium.  
• Molybdenum,  particularly under alka line conditions.  
 
Note that many constituents of poten tial concern identified on the basis of Available Conte nt of NRP 
were no longer considered  to be of concern within the Applicab le Scenar io pH Domain Range as a 
consequence of red uced solubility and appl icable to a DAF = 10.  LEAF 1313 results for these

5.4.2.4.1  Tall Column  Exper i ment  
As discussed in Section 4.10.2, a large column experiment was s et up as foll ows:  
A surface layer of either am ended so il (using NRP materials as amendment) was applied at t he 
appl ication rate equivalents to 50 t/ha/10 cm layer for the soil amend ment ma terial s. 
Leachates were collected on three occasions , as summarised in Section 4. 10.2.1 (designated  as Time 
1, 2 a nd 3).  
 
  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
155  
At each sampling event, leachates were collected fro m: 
• Immedia tely below the amended soil/material layer ; 
• Draining the tap at t he base of the  column prior to flushing, i.e. sampling inter stitial 
water  from soil voids  from the initial setting up of t he co lumn and subsequent 
leaching events; and  
• Collect ing le achate fro m the base of the column after the flushin g event described in 
Section 4. 10.2.1 . 
 
Results for analysis of the leachates are t abulated in Table A 11-1 of  Appendix A11.  In addition, 
results  for all analytes are plotted as charts presented in Append ix 12.  Ea ch chart shows the 
concentrations for the specific analyte and so il type from t he three leachate sampling points 
collected on  three occasi ons (coloured li nes and markers), with the corres pondi ng results from the 
“control” columns (i.e. no amended  soil and residue material cover layer) as black das hed lines (no 
markers).  
Analyte s wher e all concentrations were below the “lower thr eshold” value s listed in Tabl e 6 have 
very low potential for enviro nmental impact. All other analytes may warrant further  invest igation 
(Table 26), some of these are disc ussed below.  
For most cons tituents of bo th materials , it was observed that the leachate concentrati ons from the 
flushing of the column are contro lled mai nly by the soil material rather than the amendment 
material.  Exceptions to this general observat ion ar e discussed in greater det ail in the fol lowing

5.5.1   Examp le 3: H ow LEAF can be used to Assess a By -product  – Ground water 
Treatment R esidu es 
5.5.1.1 Groundwater  Residue s (Jandakot  and Wanneroo)  Characterisation  
Much of the potable water pr oduced by the Water C orporation for distribution to consumers on the 
Swan C oastal Plain is source from  shallow groundwater a quifers, notably the Gnang ara and Jandak ot 
Mounds.  Groundwater requires treatment, ma inly by aeration and flocc ulation/filtration t o remove 
constituent s such as iron and dissolved humic substances to render  it sui table for potable us e.  This 
process produ ces large volumes of fine,  solid materia ls that currently require disposal to landfill .  
Aroona is investigating  the potential for t hese materials to be used as an alternative to clean fill (and 
potentially soil am endment, subject to demonstrating benefits ). 
Aroona supplied two sam ples of ground water treatment residues for this project; one  from a 
groundwater treatm ent plant at Wannero o, and the other from  a second plant at Jandakot. Results 
for elemental com positio n of both materials (reported on an air -dry basis) are presented in Table  27. 
The results indicate the major inorganic constitue nts are aluminium (particu larly Jandakot) and iron 
(particularly Wa nneroo), most likely as hydrous oxides, with substanti al conc entrations of calciu m, 
phosphorus, sulfur and both chloride and sodi um in  the Jand akot sample.  Barium is slightly elevated 
in the Wanneroo sample, while the Jandakot materia l is comparatively  enriched in fluoride.  
Both materials contain substantial  amount s of humic substance s, as indicated by val ues of 8.55% 
and 5.73% for  the Jandakot and Wanneroo materials, respectively. The humi c substances are 
anticipat ed to be  present as complexes with hydrou s iron and aluminium oxide materia ls, which is 
consist ent wit h the podzolic chara cter of aquifer regoli th materials in this regio n. 
Both sample s contain low samples of heavy metals and meta lloids.

5.5.1.2.1 LE AF 1313 Test  
Results for analysis of ground water residue ( Jandakot and Wan neroo) are presente d as graphs in 
Appe ndix A5 -4. Characteristics of the pH dependent leaching characteristics by analyte fo r these 
materials ar e summarised as follow s: 
• Silve r:  All leachates recor ded silver concentrations below the method r eporting limit . 
• Aluminium:  Both gr ound water residue s indicated characteristic amphoteric behaviour for 
aluminium, with elevated  concentra tions at both very l ow and very high pH va lues.  L owest 
solubility of gro undwater residue noted between pH value 4.5 and 8.  At pH 7 , higher aluminium 
concentration noted in Jandakot compared to Wanneroo residue.  
• Arsenic:  Highest concentrations were recor ded at the higher pH  values about 12, alth ough 
solubility at low pH (2) w as higher than those at circum -neutral value s.  The lowest solubility for 
Janda kot was between pH 8 and 10 whereas for Wanneroo residue was at pH 4.   
Concentrations within t he pH rang e as sociated within typical soil environme nts (4.5  to 9 pH 
units) were le ss than 0.01 mg/L and therefore unlikely to present an environmental risk.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
159 • Both groundwater residu es released soluble boron, with concentrations at both low pH (pH 2) 
and hi gh pH (pH 12 t o 13) exceeding 1 mg/L.  The Jandakot residue contained higher 
concen trations of soluble boron than did the Wanne roo residue.  
• Elevated concentration s of barium, greate r than 50 mg/L, were present in acidic leachates of 
groundwater residues, e specially the Wanneroo materia l.  Minimum concentrat ions of 
approximately 0.01 mg/L  were recorded at alkaline pH values (9 to 1 2 pH units), followed by a 
slight i ncrease at pH 13.  
• Significant concentrations of beryllium (greater than 0.001 mg/L) where only  recorded at very 
low pH (<4 p H units) and very high  pH (>1 3 pH units), which is co nsistent with the amphoteric 
properties of b oron compounds.  
• Elevated concentrat ions of calcium wer e recorded from both materials at acidic pH values (<6 
pH units).  The solu bility cha racteristics were co nsistent of carbonate minerals  such as calcite 
and ar agonite.  Slightly higher concentrations (up  to 10 mg/L) were recorded at circu m-neutral 
to modera tely alkaline conditions (7.5 to 12 pH units) for the Jandakot residue.  
• Concentration s of soluble cadmium  were less than 0.001 mg/L for  both materials between  pH 4 
and 11 but increased with increasing p H to a maximum of approximately 0.0 05 mg/L at very 
high pH.  The pH dependent solubility curves were similar for both materials.  
• Chloride c once ntrations indica ted relatively little pH depen dence. Significantly hi gher 
concentrations (approximately 300 mg/L vs approximately 50 mg/L) were asso ciated with the 
Jandakot material (i.e. higher salinity).  
• Cobalt indicated amphoteric characte ristics, w ith the highest conc entrations associated with 
low pH (approximately 0.01  mg/L) and similar concentrations for the Ja ndakot residue at pH 12.  
Concentra tions within the pH  range associated within typical soil environments (4.5 to 9 pH 
units) were  less than  0.001 mg/L and ther efore unlikely to pres ent an e nvironmental risk.  
• Chro mium:  Elevated concentrations (up to 1  mg/L ) were recorded for both  materials at both 
very low an d very high pH values.  Much lower concentrations were recorded for leachat es with 
pH values between 4 and 8, although concentr ations f rom the Jandakot materi al (approximately 
0.01 mg/L) were much highe r than those from the Wanneroo mate rial (0.001 to 0.00 2 mg/L).  
• Copper: Both materials recorded near identical pH dependent curves . Maximum conc entrations 
of ap proximately 0.2 mg/L w ere reco rded at low and less th an 0.1 mg/L at very high pH values, 
indicati ng amphoteric behaviour.  Concentra tions in the pH ran ge associated within typical soil 
environments (4.5 to 9 pH units) were wit hin a rang e of  0.1 to 0.001 mg /L, presenting a 
poten tial env ironmental risk.  
• Dissol ved organic carbon concentrations were highl y variable, with minimum concentrat ions of 
1 to 10 mg/ L aligning with circum -neutral pH conditions. Maximum concentrations of 
approximately  10,000 mg/L were re corded for the Jandako t materi al at pH 13.  The Janda kot 
material released higher concentrations (typically 2x to 5x) of organic car bon than did the 
Wanneroo material at all pH values.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
160 • Fluoride concentrations were elevated for  both mate rials at very low pH  (2 pH units) and high  
(>10 pH  units), with the minim um solubility at slightly acidic and circum -neutral pH.  The 
Jandakot material contained more solu ble fluoride than the Wanneroo material.  
• Magnesium : Magnesium leaching char acteristic s we re similar to th ose described earlier for 
calcium, i.e. maximum solub ility at low pH ( Jandakot > Wanneroo ), with concentrations 
decreasing with incr easing leachate alk alinity (to < 1 mg/L for all products at pH > 8). 
• Manganese: The pH dependenc e solubili ty curves for both m aterials were similar at circu m-
neutral to strongly a lkaline pH conditions, with concentrations g enerally less than 0.1 mg/L.  
Eleva ted concentration ( >10 mg/L) were recorded for both materials under acidic conditions, 
with th e Wanneroo  material releasing higher concentrations than the  Jandakot material at a ll 
pH values between 2 and 6.  
• Molybdenum was  only present in reportable concent rations in leachate s with pH >7 pH units.  
Alkaline leachates were similar for both materials and increa sed with increasing pH to 
maximum of appro ximately  0.06 mg/L.   
• Sodium co ncentrations reflected those of chloride, in dicating that sodium chloride was t he 
principal solubl e salt in both materials, particularly in the Jandakot residue.  
• Nickel  conc entrations  within typical so il environments (4.5 to 9 pH uni ts) were within a range  of 
0.1 to 0.01 mg/L, presently minimal envi ronmental risk.  Higher concentra tions (up to 
approxim ately 0.05 mg/L) were recorded at low pH (both materials) and high pH (Jand akot).  
• Phospho rus concentrat ions were highly variabl e, rangi ng from approximately 1  mg/L to several 
hundred mg/L.  Solubility m axima were associated with very l ow a nd very high pH v alues.  The 
Wanneroo material contained slightly higher concentrations of s oluble pho spho rus at all pH 
values than the Jandakot  materia l. 
• Lead concentrations were below the method reporting limit (0.000 1 mg/L) for both materials at 
pH values greater than 6 .  Solubility increased with decreasing acidic pH values, with 
concentratio ns of appr oxim ately 0.01 and  0.05 at pH 2 for the Ja ndakot a nd Wanneroo 
materials, respectively.  
• Sulfur (mainly as sulfate) con centrations were variable, with t he Jandakot material containing 
more soluble sulfur than the Wanneroo material. Solubility minim a of appro xima tely 1 mg/L 
were observed at slightly acidic p H values (4 to 6 pH uni ts), with corresponding maximum at 
both pH 2  and alkaline pH values between 1 0 an d 14.  
• Selenium wa s only present in leachates of both materials at moderately to highly alkal ine pH 
values (>9 pH units).   Concentrations at lowe r pH uni ts were <0.001 mg/L and  therefore unlikely 
to present an environmen tal risk.  
• Tin concentrations were  of no environmental concern, with concentrations greater than 0.001 
mg/L only recorded in leach ates with pH > 12 pH units.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
161 • Titanium concentrations i n leacha tes of both materials i ndicated similar amphoteric 
characteristics.   Concentrations >0.1 mg/L very o nly recorded at very low (2 pH units) and high 
(>11 pH units).  
• Uranium also indicated amphoteric  character istics, with maxim um concentrations (>0.01  mg/L) 
recorded at very low (2 pH units) and high (>12 pH units).  Concentr ations in the pH range 
associated  within typical soil environments (4.5 to 9 pH units) were within a range of 0.001 to 
0.0001 mg/ L, present ing low environmen tal risk.  
• Vanadium conce ntration s were highly variable,  ranging from 0.0001 mg/L at circum -neutral to 
slightly alkaline conditions, and solubility maxima  of greater than 1 mg/L at very low (2 pH units) 
and high (>10 pH units).  
• Zinc concen trations were also  highly variable, rangin g from a pproximately 0.001 mg/L  at 
circum -neutral to slightly alkaline cond itions, and solubility maxima of slightly less than 1 mg/L 
at very low (2 pH units) and high pH (>12 pH units).  Concentrations i n the pH r ange  associated 
within typical soil enviro nments ( 4.5 to 9 pH units) were  within a range of 0.001 to 0.01 mg/L, 
prese nting low environmental risk.  
Results from the LEAF Me thod 1313 were used to identify constituents of potential concern (CoPC) 
in Jandakot and Wanneroo groun dwater residues  based on  methodo logy discussed in a doc ument 
published by the US -EPA in October 201 7.  This methodology is based on LEAF  test results for : 
• The Available Content, defined as the maximum concentration at end -point eluate pH 
values of 2, 9 and  13. 
• The maximum eluate concentr ation over the defined “applicable scenario pH 
domain”.  For applic ation of Jandakot and Wanneroo gr ound water residues  as fill in  
Swan Coastal Plain sandy soils, the applicable scenario pH domain  was consid ered  to 
be 5.5 to 9.0 pH units.  
The adopte d method ology is summarised as follows:  
• Calculate the leachate concentratio ns based on:  
▪ Available Content  (mg/kg ) or; 
▪ Applicable scenario pH domain (mg/kg);  
▪ L/S ratio of 10 (for Method 1313);  
▪ Dilution and  Attenuati on F actor (DAF) of  10, which accounts for reduced 
concentrations between the leachate source (i.e leaching from Janda kot 
and Wanneroo groundwater resi dues ) and the point o f compliance in the 
receiving environment (which may be down -gradient groun dwater or a 
surface waterbod y, depending on location ); and  
▪ Upper and lower threshol d constituent values listed in Table 6, for 
assessment of soil leachate conce ntrations from the ta ll column study 
(Section 5.2.4)

162 Analytes where all concentrations were below the “l ower  threshold” va lues listed in Table  6 have 
very  low potential for environmental impact.  All other analytes may war rant further investigation 
(Tables 28 and 29), some of  these are discussed below.  
It is important to note that this approach to r isk scr eening is based on  that used in Europe and  
elsewhere mainly for materials  stored as waste, and not for beneficial re -use as so il amendment 
products. Facto rs such as intended application rates (typically 20 to 50 t/ha) and interaction of 
product cons tituent s with soil (both mobilisation and attenua tion) have not been considered.   In 
effect, this method provides a first pass,  high level assessment of constitu ents of potential co ncern 
that require further evaluation, as discussed in subsequent sections.  
 
Table s 28 and 29 indica te that both materials c ontain nume rous constituents th at present 
considerable environmental risk base d on A vailable Content, despite re latively low total 
concentrations of these elements (Table 27); this is not surprising given th at thes e eleme nts were 
originally present as diss olved or co lloidal species in g roundwater prior to treatment.  However, very 
much lo wer potential risks are evid ent when the assessm ent in based on the Applicable Scenario pH 
Domain Range and a DAF of 10.  T he only  consti tuents iden tified as being of poten tial concer n using 
this approac h are:  
• Chromium in the Jandakot sample (possibl y as h exavalent chromium at elevat ed pE)  
• Aluminium in the Wanneroo sample.  
• Copper in the Wanneroo sample, but only at the alkalin e end o f the A pplicable S cenario pH 
Domain.

5.5.1.3.1 J a ndakot  
Discussion in this section focuses on three  of the element s present in the Jandakot ground water 
treatment residue that were identifi ed in Section 5 .5.1.2.1  with potential for enviro nmental impacts; 
chromium, copper and manganese.  
The chemical specia tion finger print charts for chromium are presented in Figure 56.  Key predictions 
presented in th ese charts  indicate the following:  
• LeachXS  modelli ng prov ides a reasonable  description of t he solubility of chromium in this 
material across the full pH range . Predicted leachate concentrations at L/S = 10 are generally 
with in one order of magni tude higher than exp erimental results.   
• Within the p H range of 2 to  10 pH, units, LeachXS predicts si milar chromium concentrations 
at L/S ratios of 10 and 0.4, indica ting mineral p hase control.  
• While the predictions very low concentra tions (<0.000001  mg/L ) for free chromium between 
4 and 9 pH units is consi stent wi th expe ctations, predicted concentrations  of DOC -bound 
ions (up to 0. 001 mg/L) within this pH range are much higher ; and  
• The dominant solid phase component is POM bound betwe en 2 and 10 pH units . 
LeachXS has capacit y to predict relative contributio ns from both tr ivalent and hexavalent forms of 
chromium, with proportions expected to be dependent on adopted pE v alues (hexaval ent chromium 
favoured at high pE)   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

The chemical specia tion fingerprint charts for copper are presented in Figure 57. Key predictions 
presented in these charts indicate the following:  
• As w as observed for chrom ium, LeachXS  modell ing provides a reasonable  descript ion of t he 
solubility of copper in this mate rial across the full pH range ; 
• Unlike chromium, LeachXS predicts subs tantially  lower  concentration (typically one tenth) at 
L/S = 0.4 comp ared to L/S = 10 ; 
• The sum of predicted c opper fractions exceeds the Availa ble Cont ent at very high pH (>13 
pH units).  This  effect is understood to be a consequence of LeachXS modelling a rising when 
the (extrapolated) dissolved  humic acid component exceeds  the sol id humic acid content in 
the sol id. 
• The dominant form of soluble c opper at  very l ow pH (<4) is free copper, with in creasing 
contributions from DOC bound copper with increasing pH;  and 
• The domina nt solid phase form containing copper is the POM -bound  fractio n.

The chemical speciation fingerprint charts for mang anese at two pH  values (pE = 8, denoting slightly 
oxic conditions, an d p E = 10, denoting moderately oxic con ditions) are presented in Figure 58.  Key 
predict ions presented in these charts ind icate the following:  
• As was observed for chromium and copper, LeachXS  modelling  provides a poor description 
of the solubility of mang anese i n this material across the full pH range with a nominal pE 
value of  8.  Pre dicted leachate concentrations at L/S = 1 0 are generally more the one order 
of magnitude higher than exp erimental result s, especially within the alkaline pH range. 
Increasing  the no minal pE value to 10 resulted in  a much improved alignment between 
experime ntal an d predicted concentrations at L/S = 10; 
• There is better agreement between predicted and experimen tal values at hi gher pE (pE = 
10). 
• Very high concentrations of free ma nganes e, up to 20 mg/L, are predicted f or acidic pH 
values, regardless of adopted pE valu es. Predicted concentrations of fr ee manganese at 
higher pH values decrease, although DOC -bound c oncentrations ar e predicted to be high (up 
to 1 mg/L) ; and   
• The major solid phases containing manganese are t he FeOxide -bound fraction between 7 .5 
and 1 0 pH un its, and the trivalent manganite m ineral manganite at higher pH values. The 
abundance of manganit e is predicted t o increase considerably under more oxic conditions 
(pE = 10) .  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

The leachin g characteristics of the Wanneroo groundwater treatmen t resi due were notably different 
to tha t of the Jandakot residue in severa l respec ts, not ably higher concentrations of bari um and 
lower salinity . 
The chemical speciation fingerprint char ts for barium ar e presented in Figure 59. Key predictions 
presented in  these  charts indicate the following:  
• As was observed for several metals i n the Ja ndakot residue, LeachXS  modelling provide s a 
poor description of the solubility of barium in this mater ial across the fu ll pH range. 
Predicted leachate concentrations at L/S = 10 were several orders of magnitude higher than 
experimental results und er acidi c condi tions (pH <7), and several orders of magnitude lower 
under strongly alkaline  conditions (pH >10) .  Unexpectedly, the predicted concentrations at 
L/S = 0.4 are lowe r than those predicted for L/s = 10 at cer tain pH ranges ; 
• Most of the barium i s predic ted to be present as the sparingly solubl e mineral barite (BaSO 4) 
at pH values between 2 and 12 pH unit s, with increasin g proportions of particulate organic 
matter bound mate rial at pH >6 . Proportions of the soluble DOC -bound form increase with 
increasing pH at p H values greater than 9 pH units ; and 
• LeachXS predicts concentrations of soluble barium, mainly as the free ion, to be relatively 
constant at approximately 0.02 mg /L between pH 4 and 9.

The chemical speciation fingerprint charts f or manganese are presented in Figure 60 at a nominal pE 
value of 6.   Key predictions presented in these chart s indicate the following:  
• As was obs erved fo r manga nese in the Jandakot residue, Leac hXS modelling provides a poor 
description of the solubility o f manganese  in thi s material at pH values greater than 6 under 
oxic cond itions (pE = 8).  Predicted leachate concentrations at L/S = 10 were eleva ted 
(app roximat ely 60 mg/L) and comparable with e xperimental results under strongly acidic 
conditions (pH <5),  and several order s of magnitude lower under strongly alkaline cond ition s 
(pH >10) ;  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
172 • Unlike the Jandakot mater ial, manganese was predicted to behav e at a s oluble solute under 
strongly acidic condi tion (pH <5), with the predicted L/S = 0.4 concentrations app roximately 
20 time s those predicted for L/S = 10.  This is consiste nt wi th the phase diagram indicating 
most of the manganese is present in the fr ee form under t hese pH and pE conditions ; and  
• The dominant forms of solid phase manganese under alkaline condi tions were particu late 
organic matter -bound and manganite phases, w ith t he latter increasing in concentration  
with increasing pH.

The chemical speciati on fingerprint charts for zinc are presented in F igure  61, as the available 
content of zinc  in this material  was notably higher than tha t of th e Jandakot residue. Key prediction s 
presented in these charts indicate the following:  
• As with o ther divalent meta ls with both Jankakot and Wanneroo residue, Leach XS pr edicted 
soluble zinc concentrations in reasonable agreement with  experimen tal conc entrati ons. 
Predicted concentrations of f ree zinc were approximately 1 mg/L  at pH values below 4, but 
were much lower (a pproximately 0.001 mg/L) under circum -neutral and  ; and 
• The major solid phases predicted to  be stable according to LeachXS predi ctions w as the 
POM -bound fractions between 7 and 9 pH units.   Despite the very high concentrations of 
hydrous ferric and alumini um oxide phases in this material (as well as the Janda kot sample), 
none of the zinc (and se veral other metals) were not predicte d by Lea chXS to  reside in this 
fraction.  This pr ediction is consistent with current understanding of these ma terials 
whereby th e surface sorption sites on the HFO phase are “bl ocked ’ by competitive 
adsorption by humic substances and phosphate.

5.5.1.4 Laboratory  and Field data  
5.5.1. 4.1  Tall Column E xper iment  
As d iscussed in Section 4.10.2, a large  column experiment was set up as follow s: 
A lay er of 2 0 cm of groundwater treatment resi due overlying an 80 cm layer of Bassendean 
Ellenbrook sand.  
Leachates were coll ected on three occasions, as summarised  in Section 4. 10.2.1 (designated as Time 
1, 2 and 3) . 
At each sampling event, leachates w ere coll ected f rom:  
• Immediately below the amended  soil/material layer;  
• Draining the tap at the base of the col umn prior to flush ing, i.e. sampling interstitial 
water f rom soil voids from the initial setting up of the co lumn and subsequent 
leaching events; and 
• Collecting leachate from the base of the colu mn after the flushing event described in 
Section 4.10.2.1.  
Results for analysis  of the leachates are tabulated in Tab le A1 -1 of Appen dix A11.  In addition, results 
for al l analytes are plotted as charts pres ented in  Append ix 12.  Each chart shows the conce ntrations 
for the specific analyte and soil type from the th ree leachate  sampli ng points collected on three 
occasions  (coloured lines  and markers), with the corresponding  results from the “control” columns 
(i.e. no amended  soil and residue material cover l ayer) as black dashed lines (no markers).  
Analytes where all concentrations were below the “lower threshold” values l isted in Table  6 have 
very low potential for enviro nmental impact. All other analytes may warrant further  investigation 
(Table 31), some  of these are discussed below.  
In many cases, it is observed  that the leachate con centrations from the flushing of the column are 
contro lled mainly by the soil material r ather than the amendment material.  Exce ptions to this 
general observation are discuss ed in greater detail in the  following sections. By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

Potential for mo bilisation of specific constituent s from the Jandakot  Material  
Application of Jand akot groundwater residue as a soil  cover material resu lted in brack ish leachates 
from th e Bassendean sands and the duplex soil co ntaining sligh tly elevated concentrations of various 
metals (notably copper and zinc, but not manganese). Leachates were found to contain lower 
concentrations of  phosphorus, with on ly leachate f rom Bassendean Joel s and remaining as a 
relative ly high risk ( noting that th e material was not intended for  use as a soil amendment).  
The risk profile for use as a cover material for Spearw ood sand was significant, with onl y aluminium, 
boron, copper and mo lybdenum identified a s low -level potential risks . 
Potential fo r mobilisation  of specific constituent s from  the Wanner oo Material  
The Wanneroo groundwater residue was less saline than the Ja ndakot material. Overall, the risk  
profile for leachin g metals and metalloids was simila r to that of the Jandakot m aterial.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
175 5.5.1 .4.2 Field Tri al Groundwater Tr eatm ent Residu es (Jand akot and Wanneroo)  
Results from lysimeter field trials managed by Aroona f or the Jandakot and Wanneroo groun dwater 
treatment res idues, descri bed in Section 4.10.1 .2, are presented in Append ix A13.  The r esults were 
summarised as potential risk prof iles using the same criteria adopted for the tall column leaching 
trials (Section 5.5.1.4.1 ) and the field trail (Se ction 5. 5.1.4.2 ) usi ng the thresh old values presented in 
Table 6.  The risk profi les for the wa ter treatment residues are presented in Table  32. 
Comparison of the risk profile for these materials from the field lysimeter t rials with tho se from the 
tall col umn trial (S ection 5 .5.1.4.1 ) is not appropriate becau se the soils at Wanneroo an d Jandakot 
sites were not in cluded in the tall column trial . Of the four soils used in the column trial, the soil that 
most closely resembles  the Jandakot and Wanneroo soils i s Spearwood sand, ba sed on alkali ne pH

The most significant findings from the field e xperiments were the elevated concentrations of nickel 
and lead, neither of which were as sessed as significant risks  with com binat ions of these two 
materials and the four soil  types used in the tall column experiment (Table 31, Section 5. 5.1.4.1 ).   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

5.5.1.5 LeachXS Solute Transport Modelling  – Comparison with Field and Laboratory Column 
Leachin g Data  
5.5.1. 5.1 Model Cond itions  
The predictive percolation column so lute transport modu le of LeachXS was used to simul ate leaching 
characteristics for the following scenarios:  
• A layer of 20 cm of Jand akot groundwater treatment residue overlying an 80 cm layer of 
Bassendean Ellenbrook san d. 
 
These scenarios were de signed to  reflect the condit ions of the ta ll column leachin g experiment 
(Section 4.10.1.1) . 
In addition to the chemical speciation fingerprin ts for groundwater residues , LeachXS also requires 
mod el input parameters for:  
• Column de nsity ; 
• Column diameter ; 
• Num ber of “c ells” ; 
• Column lengt h; 
• Column mobi le fraction ; 
• Phas e distance ; 
• Column porosity ; 
• Permeating solution ; and  
• Out of column flow rate.  
 
Values for model input parameters for the three modelled  scenarios are presented in Table 33. For 
several parameters relating to th e hydraulic ch aracteristics of the materials,  nominal values were 
used rather than measured values. The nominal values adopted were considered to be indicative of 
free draining sand y materials on the Swan Coastal Pl ain. The addition of the groundwater  residues 
was assum ed not to alte r the hydraulic c haracteristics of the soil (Bassendean Ellenbrook).

178 5.5.1. 5.2 Model Output Interpretation  
The following discussion co vers two constituents of potentia l concern identified as pres enting t he 
greatest potentia l risk based on LEAF Method 131 3 data over the applicable scenario pH domain for 
(Section 5.5.1.2.1)  use as a fil l material:  
• Chromium in the Jandakot residue.  
Figure 6 2 presents the LeachXS modelling output  for chromium speciati on phases as:  
• A function of L/S at 100 cm  at the base of a column of Jandakot Residue fill over Bassendean 
Ellenbrook sand.  
• The corresponding  profiles of chromium phases as a function of column d epth at L/S 0.494 
L/kg.  
The key f indings are that the leachat e from the bas e of the virtu al column is predicted to very low 
concentrations of dissolved chromium (<0.001 mg/L) , almost exclusively in asso ciation with 
dissolved organic carbon (and therefore m ost lik ely to be trivalent chromi um).  Chromium 
concentration s are much hig her in the upp er groundwate r residue layer th an the underlaying soil 
layer.  POM -bound chromium is the dominant form in both la yers.

5.5.1. 6.1 Comp arison M ethodology  
Predicted end of column leachate concentrations from Lea chXS modelling described in Secti on 
5.5.1.5.1  were compared w ith results fr om field resul ts (Aroona fi eld trial for Jand akot residue) and 
laboratory tall column leachate data using the following methodo logy:  
• Predicted end of column leachate concentration ( sum of DOC -bond and free fraction s) as a 
function of L/S, as calculated fro m LeachXS outp ut data illus trated by Figure 63 (Section 
5.5.1.5.2 ). 
• Tall column bottom of column leachate concentrations for th ree sampling events (Leach 
Number 1, 2 and 3) discusse d in Section 4.10.2.1 . 
• Lysimeter leachate concentrations from  the three sam pling events f rom the Aroon a field trial 
(Section 4.10.1.2 ) for the Jandakot groundwater treatment residue.  
 
5.5.1. 6.2 J andakot  Com parison s   
Charts comparing predicted end of column  leachate concentrations using Le achXS with Jandakot 
field ly simeter trial leachate conce ntrations and  tall column labor atory leachate concentrations for 
selected analytes are presented in Appendix A20.  
The following discussion focuses on the following ana lytes which we identified as cons tituent s of 
interest from as sessment of th e potential ri sk profiles d erived from interp retation of LEAF test, tall 
column and field trial results:  
• Sodium (as an indicato r of brackish seepage quality) ; 
• Copper ; 
• Zinc; and  
• Nick el (from Aroona field trial obser vations).  
 
Sodium  
Comparison  data for sodi um l eaching ch aracteristics  are presented in Figure 63 (noting 
concentrations are expressed against a logarithmic y -axis) .  Lea chXS predicted a rapid flush of 
sodium from the simula ted column, based on the high pro portion of free sodium in th e material 
(and soil) chemic al speciation  fingerprint (Appe ndix A8 -3). The tall column and field lysimeter 
leachate data are generally in rea sonable agreement with LeachXS predictions for sodium.    
Assessment of data for other s oluble ions (chloride, boron , potassium et c) for other m odelled 
combi nations of by-products  and soil indicated generally close agreement between LeachXS 
leachate composi tion predictions and measured values in field/laborato ry experiment leachate s.  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

Com parison data for  zinc leaching cha racteristics are presented in Figure 65. LeachXS predicted an 
initial flush of soluble zinc a t very low L/S, with much lower concentrations as L/S increases  (typically 
0.5 mg/L, mainly as free zinc) . These pr edictions alig n reasonably wel l with low measure d 
concentrations in leachates from the tall column experiment. As with copper (and nickel),

Nickel  
Comparison  data for nickel leaching characteristics are presente d in Figure 66.  As wa s the case for 
zinc, LeachXS pr edicted an i nitial flu sh of soluble ni ckel at very low L /S, with much lower 
concentrations as L/S increases. These predictions align reasonably well with low measured 
concentrations in leachates from the  tall column experimen t. As with copper and zinc (and  also le ad, 
Appendix A 20), anomalously  high concentratio ns of nickel were recorded in lysimeter leachates from 
the field trial.  
The presence of eleva ted copper, nickel and zinc in Aroona field trial lysi meter leachates is not  
consistent with LeachXS modell ing of t he source mate rial, or the tal l column laborator y experiment, 
which used Bassendean Ellenbrook soil and not local Jandakot sand. It is consid ered unlikely that the 
metals are leached from the Jan dakot sand as very low  concentrations were recorded i n all le acha tes 
from t he control plot lysimeters. Furthe r investigation of the source of these metals will be required 
if Aroona wishes to continue w ith the assessment of these groundwater residues as su bstitute clean 
fill ma terials.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

Chromium  
Chromium was identif ied as the constituent with the highest potential risk  based on LEAF 1313 
leachate concentrations within th e applic able  scenario pH domain (Table  28).  Slightly el evated 
concentrations (maximum 0.003 mg/L) were recorded in the second sampling from the tall  column 
experiment (Figure 6 7).  Very low (<0.0005 mg/ L) were recorded in al l samples from the lysimeters 
field tri al (Figure 6 7).  LeachXS  mode lling predicted ver y low concentration (approximately 0.0006 
mg/L) up to L/S = 0.2 L/kg, followed by even lower concentrations as L/S increased.  The predictions 
and experimental results indicate the chromium is not  considered to b e a consti tuent of potent ial 
concern in the Jandakot residue.

183 Fluor ide 
Although fluoride was no t identified  as a constitu ent of potentia l concern based on LEAF Method 
1313 results under the applicable scenario pH domain (Table 28), its leaching beh aviour is discussed 
in this section as the leaching ch aracteristics predict ed by LeachXS solute modelli ng differ to  those of 
othe r elements disc ussed in this repor t.  As shown in Figure 6 8, fluoride concentrations were 
predicted to be very low at low L/S, followed by a rapid increase to a  maximum of approxima tely 500 
mg/L at L/S = 0.4 L/kg, and then followe d by a decre ase to relativ ely stable conc entrations of 
appro ximately 250 mg/L (considered very high) between L/S = 0.5 to 1.5 L/ kg. However, neither the 
tall column leaching experiment nor the Aroona lysimet ers field trial recor ded fluoride 
concentrati ons above 0.2 mg /L. 
The fluori de phase specia tion diagram (shown  as Figure 6 9) for L/S = 0.4 31 indicates equilibrium 
with the mineral phase fluorite in the u pper layers, but most of the column fluoride in the lo wer 
layers is present  as free (leachable) flu oride.  DOC -asso ciated fluorid e accounts for a very small 
compon ent of soluble fluoride.  These predicted indicate elevated concentrations of fluorite are 
present in the groundwater residue layer (consistent wit h an available conten t of 2,800 mg/kg (Table 
26), which disso lves in permea ting water (des pite a natural pH o f 6.3, at which fluorite is only 
sparingly soluble). The underlying soil layer effectively ha s zero capacity to attenuate fluoride in the 
percolati ng leachate.  
LeachXS also predicted leaching behaviour contra ry t o experime ntal data for t he following 
consti tuents of Jandakot residue:  
• Barium, with “first flush” concentrations up to 50 mg/L.  Concent rations measured in tall 
column and field lysimeter le achates were <0.1 mg/ L, and of no environment al significance.  
• Arsenic, with  “first flush” concentrations up t o 5 mg/L.  Concentrations measured in tall 
column and field lysimeter leachates were <0.01 mg /L, and of no environmental significance.  
• Manganese, w ith low concentration s predicted to L/S of 0. 8 mg/L, followed  by a signific ant 
increase to  7 mg/L at L/S = 1. 5 L/kg.  All experimental values were <1 mg/L.  
• Selenium, with “first flush” concentrations up  to 0.8 mg/L.  Concentrations measured in tall 
column and field lysimeter l eachates were <0.001 mg/ L, and of no env ironmen tal 
significance.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

185 5.5.1.7 Summary  
Laboratory test results for analysis of these groundwater treatment residues ind icate generally low 
concentrations of constituent s of potential concern .  T he tall column laboratory  leaching trial  
indicated gen erally low poten tial for leaching constituents of potential concern, with substantial 
contributions of several elem ents being s ourced from the underlying Bassendean soil layer, and not 
the groundwater r esidues layer.  
Of the tw o materials asse ssed , the Wann eroo material h as the lower concen trations of constituents 
of potential concern, both in the material itself and leachates from  the column experiment.  The 
Jandakot material is saline, and a first flush  of saline leachat e may be expected when  used as fill 
material.  
Resul ts from lysimeter f ield trials set up and managed by Aroona at the Jandakot and Wanneroo 
groundwater treatment p lants were generally consistent with those of the tall  column experiment, 
apart from elevated  concentrations of nic kel and (to le sser degrees ) copper, lead and zin c.  The 
source of th ese constituent s is not known, as the available contents and concentratio ns measured in 
leachates from the LEAF 1313 test are n ot particularly high.  It is likely that  the elevated 
concentr ations are a c onsequence of contamination  of eit her the experimental site or collected 
leachates (the highest values were recorded for the th ird and final set of leachates).  
The results from this  study generally supp ort the use of groundwater treatment res idue s as fill for 
low lying a reas  on the Swan Co astal Plain, provided that:  
• Samples of material intended for use as clean fill are tested bef ore application  to ensure 
consistency of supply.  Samp les should be tested for pH and EC, as well as water soluble 
meta ls, metall oids and fluori de. 
• The fill materi al should not be exposed to low redox conditions.  Both materials contain 
elevated concentrat ions of iron and, to a lesser degree, manganese .  Thes e elements may be 
converted to soluble divalent ions under st rong ly reducin g conditions.  
• Both materials are e nriched in phosphorus.  Most of the phosphorus is predicted to be 
tightly bound to hydrous ir on or aluminium oxide minerals, or present as the inso luble iron 
phosp hate mineral strengite. Under reducing condit ions, phosphor us bound to hyd rous iron 
oxides ma y be released as soluble phosphorus following reduction of ferric iron to ferrous 
iron.  
• As wi th other materials assessed in this study, t he highest  risk for release of constituents of 
potential concern by lea ching is predi cted to arise u nder “first -flush” conditions.  Potential 
for long term impacts are considered to be of much lower risk.

186 5.5.2 Biosolid s Cake and Lime Amended Biosolids (LAB)  
5.5.2.1 Biosolids Cake and LAB By-product Characterisation  
Water  Corporation t reats 80% of W A’s waste water at t hree large wastewater treatment  plants  in 
the Perth metropolitan area – Woodman Point, Beenyu p and Subiaco.  
The liquid and solids  in waste water (s ewage)  are separated during the wastewater treatment 
process.  After treatme nt, the liquid  is released via oce an outfalls, allowed to infiltrate back into the 
ground, or recycled for industrial or other uses. The sludge undergoes extensive stabilisation by 
additi on of lime (Sub iaco) or anaerobic digestion (Woodman Po int, Beenyup).  This process stabilises 
the organ ic matter while reducing the quantity of solids and the level of pathogens.  
Two types of bios olids are produced:  
• Biosolids cake – produced at both the Be enyup and Woodm an Point wastewater treatment 
plants . 
• Lime-amen ded bio solids (LAB)  – produced at the Sub iaco Wastewater Treatment Plant.  
Results for elemental composition of samples of Biosolids Ca ke and LAB provided by Aroona for this 
project are pre sented  in Table 3 4. 
The elemental composition of both materia ls largely ref lect the nutri tional composition o f food 
products consumed by residents  (notably phosphorus), use of laundry products (sodium, sulfur and 
boron)  and water reticulation corrosion pro ducts,  notably copper , zinc, lead and cadmium.  With the 
exce ption of calci um, most eleme nts are present in l ower concentrations in LAB than Biosolids Cake 
(as a consequence of dilution by lime) – the i ncreased calcium content in LAB (110,000 mg/kg, 11%) 
is indi cative of the m ass of lime used in the stabilisation pr oces s at Subia co. 
Elevated c oncentrations of met als such as copper and zinc (mainly from corrosion of copper pipes 
and brass fittings) have c ontributed to limited scale adoption of biosolids mate rials as fertilisers and 
soil amendments for commercial agric ulture through out Australia

5.5.2.2.1 LE A F 1313 Test  
Results for analysis of the biosoli ds cake and LAB sampl es are presented as graphs in Appen dix 
A5-6.  Characteristics of the pH dependent leachin g characteristics by analyte for these materials 
are summaris ed a s follows:  
• Silver c oncentration fo r LAB were less than 0.001mg/L and no variation  was noticed over pH.   
Elevated concentra tion was noted for biosolids cake between 0.005 to 0.01 mg/L at pH 9 to 12.  
• Aluminium concentrations were much lower than those of  the other mat erials, p robably as a 
consequence of very low concentrations in the hum an diet. Elevated con centrations were not ed 
for biosolid s cake at both low and high pH values, whereas LAB has  higher aluminium 
concentration at pH values 2 and 4.  
• Arsenic : In generally  higher c oncentration (0 .2 mg/L) was noted between pH values 9 and 12 f or 
biosolids cake and for LAB concentrati on were higher at low pH values between 2 and 4. No 
variation in arse nic concentration noted at circum neutral pH for both biosoli ds cake and LA B.  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
188 • Barium : Leachate conc entrations were typically <0.1 mg/L for biosoli ds cake at leachate p H 
values above 4 whe reas for elevat ed concentrations (10 mg/L) were present in the pH 2 
leachate of LAB, probably derived from trace barium carbonate mine rals in li me. 
• Beryl lium, mercury a nd uranium concentrations were below or slightl y above the method 
reporting limit at all  pH values and therefore present very low environmental risk.  
• Boron: higher concentration was noted for both biosolids cake  (5 mg/ L) and LAB (2. 5 mg/L) a t 
lower pH and it decreases with the increase in pH.   
• Concent rations of soluble ca dmium were less than  0.01 mg/L for both materials between pH 4 
and 13 but higher concentr ations were noted at low pH 2 for biosolids  cake  (0.1 mg/L). The pH 
depende nt solubi lity curves wer e similar for both materials.  
• Calcium:  not su rprisingly, concentra tions of calcium in LAB leachates w ere typically two orders 
of magnitude higher than thos e of biosolids  cake .  Maximum concentrations recorded in pH 2  
leachates.  
• Cobalt conc entrations were  generally less than 0.1 mg/L for both material s and indicated no 
clear pH dependency.  The maximum con centration for the biosolids cake  sample 
(approximatel y 0.09 mg/L) was higher than that of the LAB sample (approxim ately 0.05 mg/ L). 
• Chrom ium concentrati ons in the biosolids cake  sample leachates were  generally less than 0.1 
mg/L between pH 4 and 12 for bo th materials. Slightly elevated concentrations (approx imately 
0.5 mg/L) were recorded in acidic (pH 2) leachates of  the LAB sampl e and are  likely to be 
derived from traces of chromium minerals present  in lime.  
• Copper conc entrations were high ly variable and  depended on both material type and pH.  
Maximum conce ntrations for LAB leachate were approximately 15 mg/L recorde d at both very  
low (pH 2) and very hig h (pH 14) leachates.  Maximum concentrations fo r biosolids  cake  
leachates were much lowe r, approximatel y 12 mg/L, and less dependent on pH.  These results 
suggest that addition of lime in production of LAB has increase d to  potential  solubili ty of 
copper, p ossibly as a consequence of forming metastable copper hydroxide mine ral phases 
from main ly copper -organ ic matter phases in biosolids  cake.  
• Fluoride concentra tions were low (approximately 0.01 mg/L) and comparable for b oth materials 
in leacha tes between 4 a nd 13 pH units.  Slightly higher concentrations  (approximately 40 mg /L) 
were recorded in  pH 2 leachates  of LAB, suggesting dissolution of trace fluoride mine rals 
present in lime.  
• Iron concentrations were generally low and variable i n leachat es of both mate rials. The 
maximum concentration recorded for L AB leachates (approxi mately 130 mg/L at p H 2) was 
signif icantly higher than the maximum concentration for bios olids cake  (approximately 60 mg/L 
and 20 mg/L at pH 2 and pH 12). The acid solution iron present in  LAB may be derived for trace 
iron mineral impu rities in lime.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
189 • Manga nese concentrations in leachates of  both materials were low (less than 0.1 mg/L).  
Maximu m concentrations were recorded for acidic leachates (pH 2 for  biosolids  cake) and pH  2 
and pH 4 for  LAB.  
• Molybdenum concentrations were less than 1 mg/L for both mater ials, with the bioso lids cake  
leach ates containing slightly higher concentrations than LA B cake leachates in alkaline 
leachates.  
• Nickel concentrations  were less tha n 1.0 mg/ L for both samp les, with the biosolids cake  
leachates containi ng slightly higher co ncentrations across the full pH ran ge. 
• Phosphorus concentrations ranged from 120 to 2,100  mg/L, with both materials recording 
maximum concentrations o f 2,100 mg/L f or biosol id and 840 mg/L  for LAB at low (pH 2).  
Concentrations in bios olids  cake  leachate w ithin the circum -neutral to slightl y alkaline range 
(180 to 600 mg/L) were significantly higher than those of LAB (16 to 56 mg/L). This observation 
is consistent wi th format ion of sparingl y soluble calcium phosphate phases (such as CaH PO 4) by 
reaction with  lime with biosolids  cake , but effe ctively completed dissolution of all calcium 
phosphate  phases at low pH.  
• Lead concentrations were less than 0.1 mg/ L in all bioso lids cake  leachates.  Sl ightly higher 
concentrations (approximately 0.3  mg/L) were recorded in the pH 2 leachate  of LAB.  
• Sulfur  (sulfate) concentrations in LAB leachates were approx imately ranged from 250 to 450 
mg/L across the pH range.  Bio solids cake  leachates w ere more variab le, with concentrations 
ranging from 330 to 480  mg/L, but with not c onsistent trend with  leachate pH.  
• Zinc concentrations were variable, ranging from 0.75 mg /L for both samples at circum -neutral 
pH to more than 80 mg/L  for biosolids  cake and more than 25 m g/L for LAB at low pH.  The 
maximum concentrati on (110 mg/L) for bio solids cake  was high er than for LAB  (29 mg/L).  
These results indicate that the elements w ith potential to leach from LAB and biosolids cake applied 
to soils are cop per, phos phorus and zinc  (Figure 70).  Addition of lime to form LAB red uces leaching 
potenti al at circum -neutral  pH 2 condition s but may increase leaching potential of sample 
consti tuents at very low pH (<4).   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

As was undertak en for other product  samples  (secti on 5.5.1.2.1) , a high -level  constituent risk profile 
for biosolids cake and LAB was undertaken using LEAF Method 13 13 d ata based  on: 
• Available content (L /S = 10) as an indication of “worst case” condi tions.  
• Measured leach ate (L/S = 10) conce ntrations withi n the applicable scenario pH domain and a 
DAF = - 10. 
The constituent risk profiles for biosolids cake and LAB are p rese nted in Tables 35 and 36, 
respecti vely.   These results indicate that the risk pro files of both materia ls include numerous 
constituents of  potential concern when the profile assessment is base d on available content. 
However, the number of constituents o f po tential c oncern is substantially r educed when the 
applicable scenario pH domain a nd DAF factors are co nsidered.  On the ba sis, major cons tituent  of 
potential concern in both materials is phos phorus, with other metals (cadmium, cobalt, chromium, 
copper,  molybdenum a nd zinc) and metalloids ( arsenic in biosolids cake, but not selenium) re quiring

193 5.5.2.2.2 LE AF Test Results, Meth o ds 1314 an d  1316, L/S Dep endence  
Results for analy sis of biosolids cake and LAB u sing method 1314 (up -flow percolation) ar e presented 
as charts in Appendix A6 -6.  Corresponding results using metho d 1316 (batch equ ilibration) are 
presented in Appendix A7 -5. 
The resul ts for each element were  generally consi stent with those present in oth er materials.  
Elements such as sodium, p otassium, chlor ide, bromide and sulfate  indicate predominantly “wash -
out” behaviour.  Eleme nts including magnesium, manganese, alumini um, barium  and copper 
indicate rel atively little d ependence on L/S and therefore more slightly to be controlled by equilib ria 
with discre te solid phases.   
Iron in biosolids cake indicated an omalo us behaviour in t hat biosolids cake leachate concentrations 
increased with increasing L/S (whi le those in leac hates of LAB decreased with inc reasing L/S).   
Molybdenum concentrations  in biosolids c ake leachates indicated only minor variation with L/S,  
whil e concentrations in LAB leachates were one to two orders of magnitude higher and decreased 
with increasing L/S .  This is inte rpre ted as molyb denum in lime used to prepare LAB exists in 
different mi neral forms to those naturally present in sewage and b iosol ids. 
5.5.2.3  LeachXS Material Characterisation and Chemical Speciation  Fingerprints  
LeachXS wa s used to genera te the chemical speciation fing erprints for both materials.  Table 37 
shows the nominal  values applied for fingerprinting of each test materi al.  Being  organic  materials, 
the concept of characterising thes e material s for parameters used fo r soil character isation presented 
issues for Le achXS modelling. The following considerat ions were addre ssed when selecting nominal 
value for LeachXs modellin g: 
• Solid humic acid   -  biosolids  cake  and LAB contain complex po lymeric or ganic compounds, 
mainly cellulose, ligni n and resistant starches presen t in food, but their properties (notably 
in relation to interaction with dissolved metals) bear little resembl ance to those of hu mic 
soil materials.  Lignin, which contains ar omatic car boxylic and phenolic gro ups, is consider ed 
to have some similar metal i nteraction characteristics to solid humic  acid.  A nomin al value 
of 10,000 mg/kg used as the estimate of “soli d hum ic acid e quivalents” in these materials.  
Use of lower value s (e.g. 2, 000 mg/kg) resul ted in u nrealistic chem ical speciation fingerprints 
for some metals as the dissolved humic acid fraction (based  on dissolved organic carbon in 
Method 1313 leachates)  exce eded the solid humic acid content.  
• Clay  -  a nominal value of 1,000 m g/kg for clay content wa s adopted for L eachXS modelling.  
This was base d approximately on the aluminium content,  much of which would be expected 
by traces of soil present in food.  
• Hydrou s ferric oxides - a nominal value of 1,000 mg/kg for hydrous  ferric ox ide content was 
adopted for LeachXS mod elling.  This was based approxim ately on the iron content, which is 
expec ted to be distr ibuted in various phases including corrosion products of wa ter servi ces 
infrastructure  and insoluble dietary iron (such  as phytic  acid derivatives).   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
194 • pE  - a nominal val ue of 7 for both materials was a dopted for LeachXS modelling, based on 
the relationship pH  +  pH  ~14 for biosolids.  As the biosolids cake w as pr oduced by 
anaerobic digestion, it is expected that lower pE values may  be appropriate.

5.5.2.3.1 B iosolids  Cake  and LAB  
LeachXS was also used to provide chemical speciation fingerprints fo r all elem ents in samples of 
bioso lids cake  and L AB.  Predictions are presented i n Appendix A8 -6 and A8 -7. 
In this Section , predicted che mical speciation fingerprints are presented for those eleme nts 
presenting the greatest potential for (site specific) en vironmenta l impacts when these mat erials are 
used  as amendments for sandy soils – copper (Figure 71), zinc (Figure 72) and  phosphorus (Fi gure 
73). 
Comparison of the chemical speciation finger print s for copper in samples of biosolids cake and LAB, 
presented  in Figure  71, indicate : 
• Experimen tal (Method 131 3) leachate concentrations indic ated only minor pH dependence 
in both mat erials, but wit h LAB leachates containing substantially higher concen trati on 
(approximately 10 mg/L) than biosolids cake leachates (ap proximatel y 1 mg/L). LeachXS 
provi ded a satisfact ory prediction curve to describe  copper solubility in biosolids cake, 
indicating mainly solid phase dissolution equilibria controlled by part iculat e organic matter 
phases.  There was poor agreement between me asured and  LeachXS predictions hig hly 
alkaline (p H >10) leachates of LAB, as a co nsequence of LeachXs predicting the prese nce of 
tenorite  (CuO) as a stable solid phase over this pH range.  
• Similar concentrations of free copper in both samples, with a predic ted minimu m 
concentration of appro ximately 0.0002  mg/L at pH 9.  However, the tot al dissolved 
concentration of copper in b iosolids cake  leachates under strongly alkaline conditions is 
predic ted to  be higher than those of LAB as a result of greater contribu tions from  the DOC -
bound fraction;  
• LeachXS leacha te concentration predictions are  substantially b etter for biosolids  cake  than 
for LAB, e specially within the alkaline pH range (in which Leac hXS su bstantially under -
estimate leachate concentrations);   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
195 • Tenorit e, with mi nor POM -bound copper, is  predicted to b e the dominant copper phase 
unde r alkaline conditions, more in LAB.  Simi larly, LeachXS also predicted greater 
concentration of POM -bound cop per in  LAB compared to biosolids  cake ; and  
• LeachXS predicted forma tion of an  ettringite copper -conta ining fraction at very high pH 
(most likely as a consequence of higher contents of calci um and aluminiu m present in lime.

Compari son of the chemical speciation f ingerprints for zinc in samples of biosol ids cake  and LA B, 
presented in Figure  72, indicate:  
• LeachXS leachate  conce ntration predictions for zinc are similar for both materials  (noting t he 
different y -axis scal es in Figure  71), but show  poor agreement with experimental data – 
notably over -estimati ng concentratio ns circum -neutral and alkaline  leachates of LAB; 
• Minim um le achate concentrations of free zinc of approximately 0.1 mg/L  are predi cted 
within the pH range  of 9 to 11 for  both materials .  Free zinc is p redicted to be the dominant 
form in in le achates of both  materials under acidic leachate conditions (pH <5) , while the 
DOC -bound fraction is predicted to be the dominant form at higher leachate pH values ; and   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
196 • LeachXS predict s similar solid phases under alk aline conditions for both materials. Will emite 
(ZnSiO 4) is predicted to be the dominant phase  in alk aline cond ition s, while POM -bound 
phases is predicted to be the dominant so lid phase under circum -neutral conditions.  As 
observed for copper, LeachXS also p redicts formation of an ettringinite phas e containing zi nc 
at very high pH values  in LAB  (but not biosolids ca ke).

Comparison of the chemical speciation fing erprints for ph osphorus in samples of biosolids  cake  and 
LAB, present ed in  Figure 7 3, indicate:  
• Both samples provided experimental con ditions th at indicated only minor dependence with  
pH.  Typical phosphorus concent ration in biosolids cake leachates (100 t o 1,000 mg/L) w ere 
similar to LAB leachates in acidic (pH <5 leachate s), b ut an order of magnitude  higher than 
LAB leachates (10 to 10 0 mg/L) in  circum -neutral and alka line leachates ; 
• LeachXS predicts much lower con centrations of phosphorus in alkaline LAB  leachates than  
the experimental re sults. The low solubility of phosp horus  under these conditions is 
predicted to be a consequence of the format ion of tricalcium phosph ate (TCP) mine rals,  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

5.5.2. 4.1  Tall Column Exper iment  
As discus sed i n Section 4.10.2, a large column experiment was set up as fo llows:  
A surface layer of either a mended soil (u sing biosolids materials as amend ment).  The application 
rate equivalents for the soil am endment materials we re: 
• 7.5 t/ha/10 cm layer for (dry)  biosolids  cake . 
• 15 t/ha/10 cm layer for (dry) LAB.  
Leachates wer e collecte d on three occasions, as  summarised in  Section 4. 10.2.1 (designated as Time 
1, 2 and 3).  
At each sampling event,  leachates were  collected from:  
• Imm ediately below the amended soil/ma teria l layer;  
• Draining the tap at the base of the column prior to  flushing,  i.e. sampling interstit ial 
water from  soil voids from the initial sett ing up of the column and subsequent 
leach ing events; and  
• Collecting leachate  from the base of the column after  the flushing event described in 
Section 4.10.2.1.  
Results for an alysis of the leachates are tabul ated in Table A1-1 of Appendix A11.  In  additio n, results 
for all analytes are plotted a s charts present ed in Appendix 12.  Each chart shows the concentration s 
for the specific analyte and soil type from the three leachate sampling p oints collected on thre e 
occasions (c oloured lines and markers), with the corresponding results from the “contr ol” columns 
(i.e. no amended soil a nd residue material cover layer) as  black dashed lines (no markers).  
Analytes where all concentratio ns were below the “lower threshol d” values list ed in Table  6 have 
very low pote ntial for environmental impact. All oth er analytes may war rant further inv estigation

In many ca ses, it is observe d that the leachat e concentrations from the flu shing of  the column are

Potential f or mobilisation of  specific constituent s from Biosolids  Cake and LAB  
The tall column experiment indicated that the risk profile as sociated with use of  Biosolids cake and 
LAB as soil amendments were  similar to those of other amendment mate rials, with slight ly higher 
risks as sociated with phosphorus, cop per and zinc.  
Lead was identified  as a potential risk arising from LAB ap plied to S pearwood sand, notin g this 
classification was based on a single ele vated (“first flush”) bottom column leach ate concentration of 
0.018 mg/L.  Th is result may be an anomaly a s no oth er elevated leach concentrations were 
recorded for leachates from  the contr ol soils, leachates from biosolids -amended soils, or subsequent 
leachates from the LAB amended Spearwood san d.  However, LAB w ould not be recomm ended for 
use an alkaline Spe arwood s ands because of potential for phyto toxity or deficiency of critic al plant 
nutrient under highly  alkaline conditions.  
Predictive solute transpo rt modelling  for soils amended with eithe r biosolids cake o r LAB was not 
cond ucted  as it was outside the p roject s cope. However,  the LEAF test data and associated chemical

5.5.2.6 Summary  
The results  from this study ge nerally support th e use of biosolids cake and LAB as “ soil conditioners” 
for sandy soils on the Swan Coastal Plain, pro vided that : 
• Consideration i s given to the hazards associat ed with path ogens p resent in biosolids cake.  
This is beyond  the scope of this study. Previous wo rk has indicated the pathoge n risk 
associated with LAB is very much lower.  
• The potential for leaching  of phosph orus from both mater ials is rated as high, particularly for 
biosoli ds cake.  Consideration by regulator s should include  limitin g application rate s for 
biosolids  cake  to sand y soils as an alternative to water -soluble fertilisers (such as 
superphos phate).  M aximum application r ates should initially be based on phosphorus 
content;  a limit of 10 kg P/ha/yr may be a ppropriate.  LeachX S may be used to p redict 
leachate quality at a pplicati on rates lower than that used in the tall column study.  
• As LAB co ntains typ ically lower concent rations of constituent s of potential concern an d has 
potential to increase alkalinity of  acidic sandy soils  (and thereby potentially reducing 
leaching ra tes of m etals), higher application rates of LAB may be considered for imp roving 
agronomic performance w ith minimal risk to the environment .  Applicati on rates up to a 
maximum of 3 to 4 t/ha e very three or four years may be appropriate for LAB usage.  Again , 
LeachX S may prove useful for predicting leachate quality under  these s cenarios.  
It is important to n ote that u sing dried biosolids in testing has c ertain limitations as the DOC is higher 
and the redox state is dif ferent. It takes longer for the material  in a co lumn to exert the same redox 
behaviour as the undried material (m icrobial a ctivity needs to be restored). In using dried material 
(which was r equired to work with in this study) a num ber of aspects can be add ressed, but the 
translation to actual co nditions  in the field is harder.   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
201 7 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION   
7.1 LEAF Test  Methodolo gy 
Through ChemCentr e, completing the method development and valida tion component of this 
project, Western A ustralian industry,  researchers and government regulatory agencie s now ha ve 
access to the following LEAF tests accredited by the National Associatio n of Testing Authori ties 
(NATA):  
• Test Method 1313 , which  determines  how liquid -solid partitioning varies wit h the pH of the 
leaching solution (from 2 to 13 pH units) using a  paralle l batch extraction method.   
• Test Method 1314 , which  determines h ow liquid -solid partitioning (LSP) varies with L/S using 
an up -flow percolati on column procedure.   
• Test Method 1316 , which  determines ho w liquid -solid partitioning varies with the L/S using a 
parallel batch extraction procedure.  
Note: Test Method 1315 (fo r monolith s) is also accredite d by NATA.  
ChemCentre demonstrated the robustne ss of the test methodology by providing  both repeatable 
and reproducible data compared with an independent  laborat ory (ECN).  
The methods were well suited for analysis of samples o f by-produ cts with the  potenti al for beneficial 
re-use in Western Australia, comprising Alkaloam, Ironman Gypsum  (IMG) , NRP , two groundwa ter 
treatment residues (Jandakot and Wanneroo ), bioso lids cake and lime amended bioso lids (LAB) . Test 
Method 1313 was a lso found to be useful for pro viding useful leachate composition data for 
geochemical characterisation of typical sand y soils occurring o n the Swan Coastal Plain . 
Leachate data provi ded by T est Method 1313 (p H dependence) is superior to that provided by th e 
ASLP met hod, the latter whic h has been widely adopted throughout Australia for classification of 
waste materials to landfill and  extend ed to assessment of mining wastes (waste rock , tailin gs and 
leach residues) and contaminated soils.   The LEAF test prov ides two additional useful par ameters;  
• Available content, defined as the maxi mum concentration (by weight in solids) available for 
leachi ng at pH 2, 9 or 13. Available content is a super ior metric to “total” concentrations or 
concentrations measured in sin gle pH lea chates, such as prov ided by the ASLP or TLCP tests  ( 
Section 3 ); and 
• Leachable concentrations within the “ applicable scenario p H domain ”, whi ch has been 
proposed by researc hers in  Europe and the US to be 5.5 to 9.0 pH units.  Although WA has a 
number of ve ry acidic soil types , this pH range i s considered suitable for Swan  Coastal Plain 
soil types.  
Test Method s 1314 and 1316 provid e useful informat ion on the behaviour of ions  as “so luble” or 
controlled by dissolution/precipitation of sparingly solu ble minera l phases, or other p rocesses 
includin g interaction with soil consti tuents including clay minerals, hydrous i ron/aluminium oxide  
surfaces or orga nic matter. Most observation s were consistent with published geochemical 
properties of well -studied potentially  environmentally sign ificant metals an d metalloids . The LEAF   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
202 test method s provide a sound empirical basis for  the behaviour of t hese elements in the LeachXS 
chemical speciat ion fin gerprint and percolation column mass transport modules.  
While the LEAF test m ethods were  used in this project for materials of inorganic origin,  two samples 
of organic materials (biosol ids cake  and LAB) p roduced by urban waste water treatme nt plants  were 
assessed as part of this project. The high moisture content, presenc e of patho gens and low 
permeab ility of these ma terials presented challenges f or reproducible and meaningful analysis o f 
these types of sa mples. ChemCentre  recommends the fol lowing pr ocedures  for preparation and 
analysis of these types of materials:  
• Removin g most of the free water by fa n-forced air dryi ng at slightly elevated temper atures 
(40C) to a residual moisture cont ent that is amenabl e to sample mixin g and homogenisatio n 
by crus hing and  grinding.  
• Recording the residual moisture content by oven drying at 10 5C to enable correction of 
measured conce ntrations to a standard oven -dry basis.  
• Use the homogenised air -dry mat erial directly for preparation of le achates using LEAF Method 
1313. 
• Prep aring blends of the  homogenised air -dry material with a coarse, in ert, acid -leached 
inorganic su bstrate (such as quartz sand) to provide suitab le samples for testing by LEAF  
Method 131 4 (up-flow column p ercolation) .  
The large column s tudy of the f our soil  types studied as controls (with no by -products) in this project 
showed pote ntial for mobilizati on of specific co nstituents from soils that inc luded aluminium, 
copper, zinc, chromium a nd/or phosphorus fo r some of the soi l types.  These findings sugg est that  
for some constituents the natural soils (as opposed to the by -products) may  significantly contr ibute 
to overall leaching characteristics of th e by -product/soil mixture.  
7.2 Chemical S peciation Fingerpri nt Assessment  
The ChemCentre research team was traine d on the use of LeachXS to provide chemical speciation 
fingerprint s of by-products, local soils and blends of the  two material types (as “virtu al materials”) 
using LeachXS modelling .  
Generally, the chem ical s peciation f ingerprints of key analytes in the by-product s are consistent with 
current understanding on the geoche mistry of these analytes and t he mineralogy of materials, viz:  
• Alkali metals,  boron and halogen ions (and nitrate ions ) were mainly p rese nt in the “free” 
form.  
• Metalloid elements suc h as ars enic, selenium and antimony, fluoride ions and transition 
metals c apable of forming stable oxyan ions at environme ntal pH and pE conditions 
(mol ybdenum, vanadium and chromium) were foun d to be predomi nant ly present in hyd rous 
iron oxide fractions. I t is imp ortant to recognise that this fraction also encompasses hydrous 
aluminium an d manganese oxide ph ases, and not exc lusively (ferric) iron oxides.  
• Many transition metal ions, notably triv alent chromium,  copper, lead and zin c, were 
associated with part iculate and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fractions, although these  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
203 phase s were gen erally minor compone nts of mineral pr ocessing by-products  (but majo r 
components of biosolids cake  and LAB).  
• The nu mber of miner al phases availab le in the thermodynamic mine ral data base (Minteq) for 
each element used by LeachXS is highly variable.  Common li thophilic elements, such as 
calcium, magnesium, aluminium, iron and  manganese are well represented, while le ss 
com mon elements (such as antimony , cadmium, cobalt , uranium  and thall ium) are 
represented by very small numbers of mineral phases.   Constituents  com monly included in  
environment al impact considerations  such as co pper and zinc are reasonably well 
represe nted. 
 
The chemical  speciation finge rprints of elements in the f our soil  types were found to be of variable 
quality .  This is not surprisi ng as thes e soils were charact erised by very lo w hydrous iron oxide and 
clay cont ents (compared to European and US soi l types) and very l ow concentrations  of many trace 
metals, metal loids an d some lithophilic elements (such as calcium and magnesium in the acid sandy  
soil types).  
Leac hXS software  requir es training, a degree of exper tise and judgement to correctly select  input 
parameters requ ired by the mode l including:  
• Redox potential (pE); 
• Clay content ; 
• Hydrous iron oxide ; 
• Solid humic acid ; and  
• The dissolve d hu mic ac id percentage of DOC  as a function o f pH.  
 
With exceptions of pE (w hich cannot be measured directly in any m aterial) and dissol ved humic acid 
(a water composition parameter ), these  parameters are important for characterisation of soils, but 
may n ot have di rect counterparts in  by-product s, particularly those of organic ori gin.   
The ChemCentre recommends adoption  of standardised me thods for measur ing clay content, 
hydrous iro n (alumi nium and manganese) and solid humic acid concen trations  in both so ils and by-
produc ts. Further d evelopment or r efinement of procedures applicab le for WA soils may be required 
for some by-products.   
In th e ab sence of some measured concentrations , no minal va lues were used and adjusted as 
required to improve the relationshi p between predicted and measur ed concentrat ions of specific 
analytes (notably  arsenic, sulfur, copper,  chromium , alumi nium and iron).  In  some cases, very good 
“curve fits” were dete rmined  using clay, hydrous iron oxide and solid humic acid concentrations that 
were inconsistent with th e analytical data. This re -affirms that correct  appl ication of the LeachXS 
models requir es both training an d a degree o f expertise and judgement.  
LeachX S chemic al speciation fingerprints for elements such as phosphorus and  sulfur were f ound to 
correlate po orly with ex perimental data for Bassendean sand s (Ellenbrook and Joel samples) and the 
sandy duplex soil (F airbridge). These soils belong to the soil gr oup know n as Podsols, which are  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
204 characterised by elevated contents of soil organic m atter associated wit h iron and a luminium oxide 
minerals. Much of th e phosphorus and sulfur in these soils, p articularly topsoil s with a lon g history of 
fertiliser applicati ons requ ired for productive agriculture, is associated with biological  
microorganism s and detritus  (dead  particulate  organic matter ), which is very dif ficult to model by 
geochemical methods.  
The predictive value  of LeachXS modelling could be  improve d for a pplicati on in Western Australia 
with the addition of applicable thermo dyna mic data t o the LeachXS minerals databa se. 
7.3 Leac hXS Percolation Column Mass Transpo rt Model Predictions  
Comparison of predic ted leacha te concentrations pr ovided by LeachXS percola tion col umn mass 
transport modelling with measured leachate concentrations  of field trial lysimeter and laborator y 
tall colu mn experiments were variable . Genera lly, r easonable agreement was obtained fo r species 
that were:  
• Present a t “high” concentrations ( greater than 1,000 mg/kg “available content” for lithophilic 
elements and greater t han 10 mg/kg for heavy metals and metallo ids; 
• Well represented by common mine ral phases in the Minteq thermodynamic mi neral 
data base ; and  
• Characteri sed by chemical speciatio n finger prints that aligned reasonably well with LEAF t est 
experimental re sults.  
 
LeachXS predictive modelling pr ovided poo r agreement with experimental data fo r elements likely 
to be present in more t han one va lence state under p H and pE conditions likely  to be e ncountered in 
soil and aquatic conditions in t he southwest of WA. Of particu lar interest were comparisons  of 
predic ted and experimental values for mater ials containing elevated concentrations o f manganes e, 
such as IMG and Wanneroo groundwater treat ment res idues. Reasonabl e predict ions were only 
obtained when very high no minal pE v alues (> 9) were  assumed . Further researc h will be required to 
develop method s for determining parameters, such as pE value s, that are more appropri ate to use 
for LeachXS mo delling  for Western Australian conditions . 
7.4 By-product Assessment  
All b y-products  assessed in this study have the potential for  use as either soil ame ndments  or clean 
fill substitutes.   
Results from this study of Ironman Gypsum  and Alkaloam , including the use of predictive  solute 
transport modelling, may provide useful information toward  future land application assessments  for 
site-speci fic, restricted use ap plications . 
Groundwate r treatment residues  produced b y Aroona have potential for use as f ill mat erials.  
Approval for  use however would requ ire consideration of  some constituents of potential co ncern to  By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA            
           
  
205 be mobilised under conditions of low redox potential, su ch as inun dation by  rising groundwater 
tables.   
Biosolids cake and LAB contain several consti tuents of potential c oncern, as ind icated by available 
contents f or LEAF 1313 testing and results f rom column leach testing (from both the materials 
themselves and the soils) . There i s however potential for both ma terials to be used as alternative 
fertilis ers (instead of water -soluble ferti lisers inc luding superphosphat e). However,  further studies 
are r equired to define maximum permissible application rates for soils  on the Sw an Coasta l Plain.  As 
LAB pre sents a dec reased risk profile in terms of cons tituen ts of potential conce rn identified in 
biosoli ds (and a considerab ly reduced pathogens risk), there is potential for use of LAB as an 
alternative to lime materials c urrently u sed to counter solid acidity of natural ly acidic soil types on 
the Swan Coas tal Pl ain. 
It is important to note that using drie d biosolids in test ing has certain limitations as the DOC is higher 
and the redox state is different. It takes longer f or the mat erial in  a column to exert th e same red ox 
behaviour as the undried material (microb ial activity needs to  be restored) . In using  dried material 
(which was required to work with in th is study) a number of aspects can be addressed, but the 
translati on to actu al condi tions in the field is  harder.  
7.5 Concluding Remarks  
ChemCentre has demonst rated that it can per form LEAF lab oratory te st methods in a rob ust and 
accredited manner.  
Chemica l speciation and solute transport modelling through Leach XS requi res both t raining and 
skilled execution  to o btain useful results. ChemCentre and other  WA scientist s have  gain ed 
considerable e xperience and expertise with the use of LeachXS  and have access to global experts in 
the field  (including those res ponsible for d evelopment  of the LEAF methodology) to further  develop 
this expertise.  
Understanding the geoch emical characteristic s of both l ocal by-product s and loca l soils is a 
prerequisite for accurate modelled predictions.  WA researchers have an extensi ve knowledge  in this 
regard. The collaborative  relationsh ips developed with  overseas  experts durin g this pr oject  will be   
useful  in adopt ing and adap ting of LEAF me thodology to Western Australian applica tions.  
This project established a LeachXS database of Western Au stralian l ocal soils and by -product s, which 
can be augmented  as other soil types and ma terials a re tested in the futu re. Such a n improved   
LeachXS databa se will have the p otential to be utili sed to provide predictions for various potential 
by-product appli cations.  
The LEAF  tools and approach can pro vide more  certainty regarding the characte ristics of  potential 
soil amend ment mater ials and the long -term e nvironmental impact of their potentia l use for specific 
applications  in Western Australia . For example, LEAF is likely to effectively assess by -produ cts as 
potential so il amendment materials to amelior ate phosphate  leachin g from the  Swan Coa stal Plai n 
sand y soils .   By-products (LEAF) Project M451 -  Final Report to MRIWA

soil amendments ( e.g. IMG + Lime A mended  Biosolid), and predicting leaching poten tial for o ther 
soil types not i ncluded in  this stu dy.

8 RECOMME NDATIONS FOR FUTURE WORK  
1. Develop suita ble LEAF certified reference materials and inter -laboratory contr ol samples  
applicable to Western Austral ian c onditions.   
Currently there in no certifie d referenc e material  (CRM) for LEAF testi ng in Aus tralia. There is 
a need to develop suitable certified reference materials for LEAF testing and to ensure an 
ongoing sou rce of suc h CRMs. A mildly contaminated soil may be  a good choice in view of 
long -term stability.  This is m ore complic ated for a n alkalin e material such as Municipal solid 
waste incinerator a sh used as in -house standard by ECN due to ongoing carbonation an d 
associat ed changes in release behaviou r of specific elements  in the long term . 
2. ChemCe ntre to en gage in regula r inter -laborator y compari sons with other LEAF accredited 
laborat ories.  
3. Reduce r eliance on nominal values for LeachXS and improve the accuracy of  Leach XS 
modelling by:  
a. Developing or imp roving method s for the determination of clay co ntent, hydrous 
iron oxide (alum inium and manganese ) content  in Western Au stralian by -products 
and solid humic acid (SHA) concentrations  in Western Australian soils and b y-
products ; and 
b. Augmenting the existing LeachXS thermodyn amic database with additional mineral 
phases applicable to We stern Aust ralia. 
4. Using LeachXS for the 1313  model description for virtual  material mixes in a downflow 
column model (including preferentia l flow) al lows to compare the samples ta ken and 
analys ed from the top of the column (Am endment ) at three -time  steps wi th model o utput. 
In a next step, the full t all column description can be run using a 40 -cell column model with 5 
cells for the amendment l ayer .
