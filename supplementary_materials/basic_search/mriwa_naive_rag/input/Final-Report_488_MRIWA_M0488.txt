3 Executive summary  
 
Project M0488 presented a geometallurgical approach to ISR processing by understanding the fluid – 
rock interactions through solid –fluid analysis after reaction. The results provide valuable information 
for fluid selection in an ISR process, which, when cou pled with other research efforts currently 
underway to progress understanding towards ISR, may help to unlock the reality of hard -rock copper 
ISR processing.  
In-situ recovery (ISR) processing has been recognised as a possible alternative to open -pit mining , 
especially for low -grade resources. In ISR, fluid –rock interaction between target ore and lixiviant 
results in valuable - (and gangue -) metal dissolution. This interaction is achieved by the injection and 
recovery of fluid by means of strategically positi oned wells. Although the application of ISR has 
become more common (ISR remains the preferential processing technique for uranium and has been 
applied in pilot programs for treating oxide zones in copper deposits), its application to hard -rock 
refractory a nd low -grade copper -sulfide deposits is still under development. Research in MRIWA 
Project M0488 focused on the possible application of ISR to primary copper sulfides that are usually 
found in deep ores.  
Lixiviant/oxidant selection is an important aspect t o consider during planning and operation for the 
ISR of copper -sulfide ores. Oxidant addition is required to break down the refractory copper -sulfide 
structure. During the course of the reaction, the fluid stability, mineral selectivity and accessibility 
(from precipitation or side reactions) may be affected, which in turn limits the application of ISR. 
Extensive  research  has been  conducted  on lixiviant  kinetics  under  heap -leaching  conditions,  especially 
for common oxidants (Fe3+ and O 2) in acid solutions for fine -grained powder, pure -mineral and 
concentrate  samples  and from  ambient  temperature  to 90°C.  However,  few studies  have  investigated 
different reagents for ISR application and with a focus on coarse  materials.  
This study focused on the changes in chemical composition of the solutions and the mineral samples 
after their reaction with different lixiviant/oxidant solutions under conditions that may simulate an 
ISR application. Copper -sulfide samples used included n atural chalcopyrite, bornite, chalcocite and 
covellite with different percent contents of gangue (e.g., pyrite, carbonates and silicates) and sample 
types that varied from powder ( –38 μm to –160 μm) to cuboids (~4 mm on each side).  
To identify potential al ternative lixiviant/oxidant solutions for ISR environments, a comparative 
analysis  of chalcopyrite  dissolution  was performed.  The tests  were  performed  on cuboids  with  eleven 
leach  solutions  (FeCl 3, CuCl 2 and K2Cr2O7 in HCl; Fe2(SO 4)3, CuSO 4, NaNO 3 and H2O2 in H2SO 4; O2 and H2O2 
in glycine;  (NH 4)2SO 4 in ammonium  hydroxide  and ferric  methanesulfonate)  at 110°C  (below  the sulfur 
melting  point)  and 170°C  (above  the sulfur  melting  point),  and under  anoxic  conditions.  Copper  
4 dissolution  tended  to increase  with  an increase  in temperature,  but some  solutions,  such  as potassium 
dichromate  and hydrogen  peroxide,  were  affected  negatively  by elevated  temperature.  Mineralogical 
characterisation of the reacted solids showed the formation of different surface layers, which 
depended  on the fluid  chemistry.  Some  of the product  phases  that replaced  chalcopyrite  had a porous 
texture  and the initial  fracture  size increased  as the reaction  proceeded.  Ferric  chloride  in hydrochloric 
acid was found to be the most efficient leach solution under the conditions  studied.  
Once the preferred leach solution had been selected, kinetic analyses were performed to identify 
energ y requirements for pure (chalcopyrite) and composite (chalcopyrite/bornite) samples when 
leached  with  ferric -chloride  solution.  Activation  energies  were  determined  by using  the shrinking -core 
model and the ‘time -to-a-given -fraction’ method. The latter meth od proved more appropriate when 
mineral  dissolution  occurred  as a result  of a combination  of mechanisms.  The kinetics  of the composite 
samples were driven by the major phase present, and the activation energy increased because of the 
presence of chalcopyrite. Fitting of the experimental data by the shrinking -core model led to 
inaccurate estimates of activation energies, which im plies that the model used was not ideally suited 
to the data. This result suggests that, for ISR targets (composite that contains gangue), the best 
approach for kinetic analysis is to use model -independent equations that allow for the calculation of 
activa tion energies throughout the reaction. The calculation of partial activation energies helps to 
understand the propensity for subsurface solid transformation and the dissolution  rates.  
Experiments  were  conducted  under  replicate  ISR conditions  to identify  copper -sulfide  transformations 
and mineralogical changes in acidic solutions with depleted oxidant. Even at low temperatures, bornite 
and chalcocite/digenite transformed to covellite. The replacements showed characteristic features of 
an interface -coupled di ssolution –reprecipitation mechanism, such as sharp chemical interfaces and 
porosity development in newly formed phases. Bornite transformations indicated the coexistence of 
an interface -coupled dissolution –reprecipitation mechanism with solid -state diffusi on processes by 
the formation of fluid -mediated exsolution of copper -deficient  lamellas.  
Finally, multistage fluid –rock interactions were studied using natural low -grade samples with a high 
concentration of gangue to replicate fluid movement through subsur face ore. Acid consumption and 
changes in pH resulted in the precipitation of jarosite, akaganeite and gypsum because of cation and 
anion build up in solution. Sulfate solutions showed higher precipitation rates compared with 
chlorides,  but NaCl  addition  increased  gypsum  precipitation.  The precipitates  act as passivation  layers 
and could produce blockages that pose a risk for subsurface ISR  operations.

1. Introduction  
 
1.1 In-situ recovery of copper sulfides  
 
In-situ recovery  (ISR)  is a mining  technology  that refers  to the extraction  of valuable  metals  from  within 
an orebody without the removal of physical rock (Bates, 1987). ISR is not a new technology; this 
technique has  existed for  more  than  65 years,  but has increased  in popularity  during  the last 15 years 
(Seredkin  et al., 2016).  The increase  in acceptance  of ISR is related  to an increase  in demand  for metals 
and more  stringent  environmental  regulations  paired  with  a depletion  of deposit  grades,  and technical 
limitations for low -grade -ore extraction. ISR provides an opportunity for copper recovery  from low - 
grade copper -bearing sulfides that could otherwise produce large volumes of waste rock by using 
conventional  hydro - or pyrometallurgical  processes  (Williamson,  1998).  The ISR methodology  includes 
the injection of a lixiviant solution via injecti on wells, which, when in contact with ore, induces 
chemical reactions that result in mineral dissolution and valuable metal recovery into the pregnant 
solutions. The resultant solution moves to a recovery well and is pumped back to the surface for 
further processing. Figure 1 shows an idealised diagram of an ISR system in an unmined  area.

ISR is applied in uranium mining operations globally (e.g., USA, Kazakhstan) and accounts for more 
than 50% of global production. Copper deposits may also be promising candidates for ISR, especially 
for oxidised zones where sulfuric acid is the preferred lixiviant. Copper ISR has been applied to oxide 
zones  in the USA and Russia  (such  as at San Manuel,  Silver  Belt,  Miami,  Florence  and Gumeshevskoye) 
(Seredkin  and Savenya,  2019).  In Australi a, prior  ISR operations  have  been  relatively  unsuccessful,  such 
as at the Mutooroo deposit in South Australia in 1983 (Haque et al ., 2014).  
ISR presents  several  advantages  compared  with  conventional  mining  techniques,  including  a low initial 
capital requirement and low development costs (Seredkin et al., 2016), a lower surface disturbance, 
accessibility to deep ore bodies, less dust and noise contamination and the option to process low - 
grade ores that would otherwise be considered une conomical. Challenges in ISR copper operations 
include the prevention of groundwater contamination, ore accessibility enhancement and an 
understanding of the required lixiviant solutions (Djordjevic,  2016).  
To be a suitable candidate for ISR exploitation, copper mineralisation should fulfil certain physico - 
chemical requirements. Copper mineralisation occurs in primary magmatic ores, secondary 
enrichment zones, and veins in igneous rocks and sediments (Habashi, 1978). Based on their source 
and characteristi cs, copper  deposits  can be classified  as sediment -hosted  or porphyry  copper  deposits 
(Williamson, 1998). Most copper minerals are present as copper sulfides (chalcopyrite, bornite, 
chalcocite and covellite) (Bulatovic, 2007) with primary copper -sulfide min erals (hypogene) being 
separated from the altered oxide zone (supergene) by a partially oxidised zone that is enriched in 
secondary copper -sulfide minerals. Hard -rock copper minerals, such as chalcopyrite, represent more 
than 70% of global copper (Li et al ., 2013).  
Refractory copper -sulfide (chalcopyrite, bornite, chalcocite, covellite) deposits may be candidates for 
ISR processing; such mineralisations may be low -grade (which makes them uneconomical to process 
by conventional  means)  and they  usually  exist  at medium  depths  (0.5 km) to depths  that exceed  2 km 
(Wallace, 1979). Therefore, some of these refractory deposits are located deeper than ideal open pit 
and underground targets may be. The implementation of copper ISR has been applied mainly to 
poro us ores,  and no low-accessibility  hard -rock  copper -sulfide  ores  have  been  processed  by ISR. These 
mineral types are more difficult to leach than oxide ores, and an understanding of the rock changes 
that result from fluid interaction is a key point to unloc k their successful exploitation. Unlike oxide 
minerals that are soluble in acid or alkaline lixiviants, in the hydrometallurgical processing of copper - 
sulfide minerals, an oxidant is necessary for sulfide oxidation to release copper into solution 
(Schlesi nger et al ., 2011). Furthermore, primary -sulfide dissolution from primary copper sulfides can 
show slow leach kinetics (see Table 1).

1.2 Gaps in current  knowledge  
 
Mineral dissolution and fluid stability  
 
An understanding of lixiviant/oxidant responses beyond the commonly studied temperature (and 
pressure) regimes may be required for execution of ISR. Uncontrollable changes in temperature and 
solution concentrations in an ISR environment may affect the solu tion pH and Eh, which could yield 
undesirable  reactions  and result  in precipitate  formation.  Therefore,  an evaluation  of the efficiency  of 
lixiviant systems should be conducted under conditions that replicate the ISR  environment.  
As chalcopyrite is the mos t abundant copper sulfide, its successful hydrometallurgical processing 
would be advantageous. Chalcopyrite leaching studies have attracted significant interest. The most 
common oxidant that has been investigated extensively because of its cost and availab ility is ferric 
sulfate paired with sulfuric acid. When iron(III) is used as an oxidant, ideally, the complete oxidation 
of sulfide  to sulfate  and copper  and iron release  into solution  by chalcopyrite  dissolution  should  result 
(Equation  1).

A variety of other oxidants, acids and bases have been tested in hydrometallurgical processing. 
Oxidants include Cu2+, O 2, Cr 2O 2₋, NO ₋, H2O2 and O 3 in sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid,  
nitric  acid,  ammonium  hydroxide  and glycine  (Antonijević  et al., 1994;  Aydogan  et al., 2006;  
8 Beckstead  and Miller,  1977;  Córdoba  et al., 2008;  Dutrizac  and Macdonald,  1978;  Dutrizac  et al., 1970; 
Oraby and Eksteen, 2014; Ruiz et al., 2011; Shiers et al., 2016; Sokić et al., 2009; Velásquez -Yévenes et 
al., 2010). Solutions have been tested under different conditions to evaluate their ability to extract 
copper from ores or concentrates. Test te mperatures have been studied from room temperature to 
90°C, with only a few studies exceeding 100°C (McDonald and Muir, 2007). ISR processing may be 
conducted at elevated temperatures (> 90°C) with restricted oxygen availability. To the author’s 
knowledge,  limited research exists on the behaviour of these fluids and their impact on mineral 
dissolution and fluid stability under simulated ISR  conditions.  
Reaction kinetics and mechanisms  
 
Natural deposits are heterogeneous, and in an ISR operation, the targeti ng of value minerals only is 
difficult. Composite natural ores contain gangue and different copper minerals, which makes it difficult 
to extrapolate results from fundamental kinetic and mineralogical studies that are available in the 
literature. Possible i nteractions between phases in targeted minerals may affect energy requirements  
for dissolution  and enhance  precipitation  rates  as a result  of re-equilibration.  The kinetic analysis  of 
copper -sulfide  dissolution  has been  studied  for pure  concentrate  samples  (Ahn  et al., 2018; Dreisinger 
and Abed, 2002; Dutrizac, 1981; Hirato et al., 1987). Because beneficiation is not possible in an ISR 
environment, an understanding of the kinetics of dissolution of natural gangue -containing samples is  
necessary.  
Compositional and morphological transformations  
 
Compared with tank, vat and heap leaching operations, ISR operation is challenging in terms of the 
control of leaching conditions. ISR requires a continuous flow of lixiviant along flow paths. A 
cont inuous  interaction  of the fluid  and the rock  produces  physical  and chemical  changes  (Williamson, 
1998). The enhancement or reduction of permeability and porosity from sulfide dissolution or 
precipitation,  respectively,  has not been  studied  extensively,  and to the author’s  knowledge,  only  Yang 
et al. (2019) described an increase in porosit y in a low -grade chalcopyrite after leaching with ferric 
chloride solutions at 80°C. Porosity and permeability at the microscale can be compromised by the 
formation of surface layers that reduce the dissolution rate and, in the worst scenario, cause the 
dissolution  to cease.  This phenomenon  has been  described  as “passivation”.  It has also been  suggested 
that sulfur formation is responsible for the reduction in copper dissolution (Córdoba et al., 2009; 
Dutrizac, 1990). Therefore, an analysis of the reacted s olid is important to understand the reaction - 
driven solid change and to avoid the potential for pathway clogging or  “short -circuiting”.  
Low -grade ore dissolution and the effect of gangue minerals  
 
Low-grade ores contain higher amounts of gangue minerals, which increases the possibility of side  
 
9 reactions, precipitation, acid consumption and an accumulation of cations and anions in solution 
(Sinclair and Thompson, 2015). Permeability may be affected as a result of gangue dissolution. The 
dissolution response of low -grade minerals under ISR conditi ons is not available in the literature.  
1.3 Research objectives  
 
The aim of this research  was to fill existing  knowledge  gaps  by analysing  and understanding  the fluid – 
rock interaction of copper -sulfide minerals with a variety of lixiviant/oxidant systems unde r expected 
ISR conditions. The specific objectives  include:  
• To identify the extent and rates of mineral dissolution for commonly used and non -standard 
lixiviant/oxidant solutions under ISR conditions, including an understanding of the dissolved 
species sol ubility and solution stability and its impact on copper recovery  rates.  
• To understand the interaction between the fluid and the rock (dissolution/precipitation 
behaviour) with a focus on the reaction mechanisms and kinetic behaviour for pure and 
composite  ores.  
• To understand  the fluid -mediated  compositional  and morphological  transformations  of coarse 
pieces of copper sulfides by interaction with different solutions (with and without oxidant), 
including secondary mineral formation and reaction products (iron  precipitates, compact 
crystalline or non -crystalline sulfur layers, silica gel formation or hydroxide precipitation) at 
elevated temperatures (90°C to  170°C).  
• To identify the effect of gangue -related reactions on the rock morphology (precipitation) and 
its influence on solution  access.  
1.4 Significance  
 
In-situ recovery  offers  a step -change  approach  to the extraction  of sub-surface  values,  when  executed 
efficiently  and effectively.  The application  depends  on an appropriate  knowledge  of the target  mineral 
system and the interaction of the said mineral system with the selected lixiviant system. The findings 
of this work present new information to contribute to the design of optimal extraction/recovery 
approaches in future ISR projects, which may incl ude the lixiviant/oxidant selection, well spacing and 
initial reagent  concentrations.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10 2. Approach  
 
To address the research gaps:  
 
• Eleven lixiviant/oxidant solutions were compared in experiments on coarse chalcopyrite 
samples at elevated temperatures and pressures. The copper -leaching behaviour with the 
different lixiviant systems was described, and included the product phases, fluid stability and 
copper -dissolution  rate.  
• Experiments were conducted to understand the kinetics of chalcopyrite and composite 
chalcopyrite/bornite sample leaching with an acidified ferric -chloride solution to understand 
how  the sample  complexity  affects  the kinetic  analysis  and to identify  the best  manner  to study 
composite sample kinetics (composites will be a characteristic ISR  target).  
• Solids behaviour under ISR operations, including deviations from ideal conditions (such as 
oxidant and acid de pletion) and the presence of gangue, should be understood. The leaching 
behaviour  of natural  copper -sulfide  samples  (bornite/chalcocite)  was studied  in acidic  solutions 
in the absence  of oxidant;  rock  transformation  to copper -enriched  phases  occurred  and possible 
explanations of the transformation mechanism were presented. An experimental simulation of 
depleted  acid conditions  (as may  occur  in a real ISR scenario  when  fluid  travels  from  the injection 
to recovery wells) was also  undertaken.  
3. Conclusions and recommendations for ISR  application  
 
This research served as a component of work being undertaken to unlock the potential for hard -rock 
ISR. Experiments focused on an analysis of fluids and solids that had been leached under simulated 
ISR cond itions. Analytical techniques were used for solids characterisation and allowed for the 
identification of morphologies, chemistry and textures of the reacted solids. Conclusions were made 
based on gaps in knowledge and are presented with recommendations fo r ISR implementation.  
• Mineral dissolution and fluid stability : Under similar conditions, the various leaching fluids 
showed different copper leaching efficiencies, with chloride solutions showing the best 
performance for chalcopyrite dissolution above 60°C. At 90°C, other fluids that proved 
promising at lower temperat ures were affected detrimentally (e.g., potassium dichromate). 
The accessibility was enhanced by certain fluids (e.g., ferric and copper chloride) and increased 
the number of fractures, the surface area and the porosity. When the fluid was negatively 
affec ted by changes in pH and acid consumption, this accessibility enhancement was 
compromised, and undesired precipitation reduced the solid permeability and copper 
dissolution rates. High -temperature experiments allowed for a comparison with  low- 
 
11 temperature experiments and filled knowledge gaps. Tests to simulate low -oxygen 
environments that are expected in deep ore bodies showed copper dissolution in several 
solutions (FeCl 3 and K 2Cr2O7 in HCl). Therefore, ISR could be possible at a  high temperature 
even with a low oxygen solubility. Based on different selection criteria, FeCl 3 + HCl was found 
to be the most efficient solution for chalcopyrite dissolution in the presence of pyrite above 
90°C.  
• Reaction kinetics and mechanism : An under standing of the kinetics of composite samples is 
important  for ISR because  of the lack of selectivity  in real operation.  Activation  energies  were 
determined from kinetic studies of composite samples. The energy requirements changed 
when more than one phase was present. In these cases, empirical equations may not fit the 
experimental data, and an alternative method for energy calculation should be applied, such 
as the ‘time -to-a-given -fraction’ methodology. This method can be used to calculate the 
energy requirements for different reaction stages and composite samples with a high 
concentration of gangue and valuable mineral sources, which makes i t a valuable tool for ISR 
leaching characterisation. Some product formation showed characteristic features of interface 
coupled dissolution –reprecipitation, including a sharp chemical interface and porosity 
development in the newly -formed phases (Pollok et  al., 2011; Putnis, 2002; Putnis, 2009; 
Putnis, 2015; Ruiz -Agudo et al., 2012; Ruiz -Agudo et al., 2014; Xia et al., 2009). At ISR 
temperatures, the coexistence of interface coupled dissolution –reprecipitation and solid - 
state diffusion was found; the speci fic characteristics of each mechanism have important 
implications on the resulting product textures and may affect the microscale permeability of 
the ores.  
• Compositional and morphological transformations: The product layers were influenced by 
the local fluid chemistry and changed over the course of the reaction. Furthermore, under 
similar conditions and using the same solution, different product layers were found among 
copper sulfides (chalcopyrite, bornite  and chalcocite). Sulfur was the main product that 
formed during leaching, as was also presented by Dutrizac (1990). The texture of the sulfur 
layers  depends  on the fluid  chemistry  and on the leached  mineral.  The sulfur  porosity  changed 
in the presence  of chloride  when  chalcopyrite  was leached  and evolved  with  reaction  time  by 
healing  the porosity  as shown  by the bornite  solids.  Copper -enrichment  phases  resulted  from 
chalcopyrite oxidation and were produced mainly when copper was concentrated in fluids. 
The copper -enrichment phases showed no passivation; these phases also formed with 
depleted  oxidant  and with  acid only  present  in the fluid  and leached  more  rapidly  with  oxidant 
addition  after  the initial  transformation.  The transformations  followed  the reactive  zones  and 
 
12 transformed the entire mineral, and in some cases the surrounding gangue minerals and 
impermeable zones. Fractures trigger ed the initial transformation and retained the effective 
permeability and porosity through contact with the ore. Passivation resulted when iron 
precipitates formed during multistage fluid –rock interactions in sulfate solutions because of 
the formation of j arosite that coated the chalcopyrite surface.  
• Low -grade ore dissolution and the effect of gangue minerals: When a higher content of 
gangue was present initially and there was continuous fluid –rock interaction above 90°C, an 
increase  in precipitation  result ed. Precipitation  resulted  from  the increase  in concentration  of 
anions and cations in solution even with a slight increase of pH. The increase in cation and 
anion concentrations in fluids caused iron hydrolysis, especially in sulfate solutions. The use 
of such solutions in the presence of gangue may induce fracture blockage and passivation of 
the reactive surfaces. Even though an increase of acidity and continuous pumping could 
counteract some of these effects, prolonged fluid –rock contact will accelerate acid 
consumption along the flow pathway. Thus, careful oxidant selection to minimise these 
adverse effects is  vital.  
The outcomes  of this research  highlight  the importance  of geometallurgical  analysis  for ISR operations. 
The analysis of fluid and rock behaviour is a valuable tool for initial fluid selection to avoid issues 
associated with reactions and solid transformations. The main conclusion from this research is that 
solid transformations are dynamic and ar e related closely to fluid  chemistry.  
Based on these results, recommendations for ISR operations include:  
 
• Optimal fluid selection: Fluid selection should be based on copper dissolution, stability at a 
chosen temperature, passivation behaviour, environment al impact, accessibility 
enhancement and cost. Some fluids proved promising when assessed according to many of 
these  points  (e.g.,  ferric  chloride,  sodium  nitrate  and copper  chloride).  Although  ferric  sulfate 
solution tends to be the preferred industry choice, this solution shows a low copper 
dissolution, passivation behaviour and temperature instability. The cost savings that are 
possible in ISR operations compared with conventional mining (Seredkin et  al., 2016) may 
allow for a more expensive fluid  selection.  
• Use of pre -treatments or mixed systems: The use of mild hydrothermal solutions (e.g., low - 
concentration Cu2+ solutions or acidic solutions) results in enriched copper phases (Cai et al., 
2011; Ce rda et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2014). This resulting phase may be soluble because the 
textural and morphological transformation increases the reactivity of the ore compared with 
the unreacted ore. Subject to time constraints, pre -treatment with affordable acidic 
hydrothermal solutions could be used to replicate natural transformations  (geomimetics)  
13 followed by aggressive oxidation to increase the copper recovery rate and ore accessibility. 
Chalcopyrite transformed to copper -enriched phases in acidic solutions when fractures were 
present. Therefore, the simultaneous application of blasting with pre -treatment or staged 
dissolution may allow for an increased chalcopyrite replacement rate.  
• Composite solid kinetics: In the case of composite solids with more than one source of 
valuable  metal,  kinetics  were  most  affected  by the dominant  phase.  The energy  requirements 
(activation energies) changed during the reaction. The best approach for kinetic analysis is to 
use the ‘time -to-a-given -fraction’ method, which can be applied to ISR complex  ores.  
• Reaction -driven accessibility enhancement: Optimal leaching behav iours depend to a large 
extent on ensuring fluid –rock contact. Textural transformations occurred after all reactions, 
with the reaction -driven enhancement of initial fractures and the enhancement of fluid –rock 
contact being of significance. Aggressive solu tions provided major fracture networks that 
enhanced the fluid pathways. Mechanical accessibility enhancement is mandatory for 
chalcopyrite leaching below 90°C. Fluid selection could assist microscale accessibility, 
generate effective porosity and increase  the overall  permeability.  
• Oxidant/lixiviant influence in precipitations: Within the ranges tested, oxidant and acid 
concentrations  did not influence  the chalcopyrite  and bornite  dissolution  kinetics  significantly. 
Higher oxidant concentrations were counterproductive for some solutions and increased 
precipitation resulted when pH and acid concentrations were not maintained. The use of 
saline or hypersaline water may increase cation and anion concentrat ions, which could cause 
jarosite/akaganeite/gypsum precipitation, especially at higher temperatures, which, in turn, 
could produce major blockages in hard -rock fracture channels, scale and corrosion in pipes. 
An increase in salinity and continuous contact with fresh solid resulted in an increase in acid 
consumption. Therefore, oxidant concentrations should be based on the initial copper 
concentration in the solid with limited excess. The use of saline water is not recommended 
when high concentrations of cat ion-containing gangue is present in the ore, especially when 
ferric sulfate in sulfuric acid is used as the leach solution. The monitoring of fluid changes by 
continuous sampling and, if possible, by real -time analysis of groundwater (such as by using 
new techniques, such as Sensei® sensors (Caruso et al., 2018)) could prevent precipitation, 
which could have important repercussions for hard -rock  permeability.  
This work provides a starting point in terms of the understanding of fluid –rock interactions under ISR 
conditions. In future, the geological identification of candidate samples for ISR processing and fluid 
selection  should  be applied  to Australian  copper  ores.  Similar  studies  could  also be expanded  to other 
commodities, such as nickel or gold. Differenc es were visible between fine -grained and  cuboid  
 
14 samples. Work could be expanded to understand copper -sulfide leaching of cores, and hard -rock 
kinetic analysis could be conducted to understand the effect of a reduced surface area. Experimental 
apparatus may include column leaching and flow -through reacto rs. The extent of accessibility 
enhancement on copper dissolution by selected lixiviants should be compared with that of blasted 
solids, such as those that may be expected to be produced for in -mine recovery (IMR) (Mousavi and 
Sellers, 2019) and hard -rock ISR applications.

5. Final  comments  
 
Project M0488 was a great success in terms of outputs and novel research contribution. This was in 
large part due to the commitment and hard work by PhD student, Tania Hidalgo. Several areas for 
additional research on different commodities or a potential f or the expansion of the current results 
have been identified, with potential for the presentation of new research proposals to MRIWA.

Abstract  
 
 
Abstract  
 
In-situ recovery  (ISR)  processing  has been  recognised  as a possible  alternative  to open - 
pit mining, especially for low -grade resources. In ISR, the fluid –rock interaction 
between the target ore and the lixiviant results in valuable - (and gangue -) metal 
dissolution. This interaction is achieved by the injection and recovery of fluid by m eans 
of strategically positioned wells. Although the application of ISR has become more  
common  (ISR  remains  the preferential  processing  technique  for uranium  and has been 
applied in pilot programs for treating oxide zones in copper deposits), its application  
to hard-rock refractory  and low-grade  copper -sulfide  deposits  is still under 
development. This research is focused on the possible application of ISR to primar y 
copper sulfides usually found as deep  ores.  
 
Lixiviant/oxidant selection is an important aspect to consider during planning and 
operation  in the ISR of copper -sulfide  ores.  Oxidant  addition  is required  to break  down 
the refractory copper -sulfide structur e. During the course of the reaction, the fluid 
stability, mineral selectivity and accessibility (from precipitation or side reactions) 
may be affected, which in turn limits the application of ISR. Extensive research has 
been conducted on lixiviant kinetic s under heap -leaching conditions, especially for 
common oxidants (Fe3+ and O 2) in acid solutions for fine -grained powder, pure - 
mineral and concentrate samples and from ambient temperature to 90°C. However, 
few studies have investigated different reagents for ISR application and with a focus 
on coarse  materials.  
 
This study focuses on the changes in the chemical composition of both the solutions 
and the mineral samples after their reaction with different lixiviant/oxidant solutions 
under conditions that may simulate an ISR application. Copper -sulfide samples used 
included natural chalcopyrite, bornite, chalcocite and covellite with different percent 
contents of gangue (e.g., pyrite, carbonates and silicates) and sample types that  varied 
from powder ( –38 μm to –160 μm) to cuboids (~4 mm on each  side).  
To identify potential alternative lixiviant/oxidant solutions for ISR environments, a 
comparative analysis of chalcopyrite dissolution was performed. The tests were 
performed on cuboids with eleven leach solutions (FeCl 3, CuCl 2 and K 2Cr2O7 in HCl;  
 
3 Abstract  
 
 
Fe2(SO 4)3, CuSO 4, NaNO 3 and H 2O2 in H 2SO 4; O 2 and H 2O2 in glycine; (NH 4)2SO 4 in 
ammonium  hydroxide  and ferric  methanesulfonate)  at 110°C  (below  the sulfur  melting 
point) and 170°C (above the sulfur melting point), and under anoxic  conditions. 
Copper dissolution tended to increase with an increase in temperature, but some 
solutions, such as potassium dichromate and hydrogen peroxide, were affected 
negatively by elevated temperature. Mineralogical characterisation of the reacted 
solids showed the formation of different surface layers, which depended on the fluid 
chemistry.  Some  of the product  phases  that replaced  chalcopyrite  had a porous  texture 
and the initial fracture size increased as the reaction proceeded. Ferric chloride in 
hydrochloric acid was found to be the most efficient leach  solution.  
Once the preferred leach solution had been selected, kinetic analyses were performed 
to ident ify energy requirements for pure (chalcopyrite) and composite 
(chalcopyrite/bornite) samples when leached with ferric -chloride solution. Activation 
energies  were  determined  by using  the shrinking -core model  and the ‘time -to-a-given - 
fraction’  method.  The latter method  proved  more  appropriate  when  mineral  dissolution 
occurred as a result of a combination of mechanisms. The kinetics of the composite 
samples were driven by the major phase present, and the activation energy increased 
because of the presence of chalcopyrite. The experimental data could not be fitted 
accurately to the equations in the shrinking -core model and led to incorrect estimates 
of the activation energies. This result suggests that, for ISR targets (composite with 
gangue), the best approach  for kinetic analysis is to use model -independent equations 
that allow for the calculation of activation energies throughout the reaction. The 
calculation of partial activation energies helps to understand the propensity for 
subsurface solid transformation  and the dissolution  rates.  
Experiments  were  conducted  under  replicate  ISR conditions  to identify  copper -sulfide 
transformations and mineralogical changes in acidic solutions with depleted oxidant. 
Even at low temperatures, bornite and chalcocite/digenite transformed to covellite. The 
replacements showed characteristic features of an interface -coupled dissolution – 
reprecipitation (ICDR) mechanism, such as sharp chemical interfaces and porosity 
development in newly formed phases. Bornite transformations indicated the 
coexistence of an ICDR mechanism with solid -state diffusion processes by the 
formation o f fluid -mediated exsolution of copper -deficient  lamellas.  
 
 
4 Abstract  
 
 
Finally, multistage fluid –rock interactions were studied using natural low -grade 
samples with a high concentration of gangue to replicate fluid movement through 
subsurface ore. Acid consumption and changes in pH resulted in the precipitation of 
jarosite, a kaganeite and gypsum because of cation and anion build up in solution. 
Sulfate  solutions  showed  higher  precipitation  rates  compared  with chlorides,  but NaCl 
addition  increased  gypsum  precipitation.  The precipitates  act as passivation  layers  and 
could produ ce blockages that present a risk for subsurface ISR  operations.  
This research presents a geometallurgical approach to ISR processing by 
understanding the fluid –rock interactions through solid –fluid analysis after reaction. 
The results provide valuable info rmation for fluid selection in an ISR process, which, 
when coupled with other research efforts currently underway to progress 
understanding towards ISR, may unlock the reality of hard -rock copper ISR 
processing.

1.1. In-situ recovery of copper sulfides  
 
In-situ recovery (ISR) is a mining technology that refers to the extraction of valuable 
metals from within an orebody without the removal of physical rock (Bates, 1987). 
ISR is not a new technology;  this technique  has existed for more  than 65 years,  but has 
increased in popularity during the last 15 years (Seredkin et al., 2016). This increase 
in acceptance is related to an increase in demand for metals and more stringent 
environmental regulations paired with a depletion o f deposit grades, and technical 
limitations for low -grade -ore extraction. ISR provides an opportunity for copper 
recovery from low -grade copper -bearing sulfides that could otherwise produce large 
volumes of waste rock by using conventional hydro - or pyrome tallurgical processes 
(Williamson,  1998).  The ISR methodology  includes  the injection  of a lixiviant  solution 
via injection wells, which, when in contact with ore, induces chemical reactions that 
result in mineral dissolution and valuable metal recovery int o the pregnant solutions. 
The resultant solution moves to a recovery well and is pumped back to the surface  for 
further processing. Figure 1 -1 shows an idealised diagram of an ISR system in an 
unmined  area.

Sinclair and Thompson, 2015). Red and blue arrows represent continuous flow between  
29 
Chapter 1  
 
 
the ore and the wells, red arrows represent injected lixiviant solution and blue arrows 
pregnant solution recovered for processing.  
 
ISR is applied in uranium mining operations globally (e.g., USA, Kazakhstan) and 
accounts for more than 50% of global produ ction. Copper deposits may also be 
promising candidates for ISR, especially for oxidised zones where sulfuric acid is the 
preferred  lixiviant.  Copper  ISR has been  applied  to oxide  zones  in the USA  and Russia 
(San Manuel, Silver Belt, Miami, Florence and Gu meshevskoye) (Seredkin and 
Savenya, 2019). In Australia, prior ISR operations have been relatively unsuccessful, 
such as at the Mutooroo deposit in South Australia in 1983 (Haque et al., 2014).  
 
ISR presents several advantages compared with conventional mining techniques, 
including  a low initial  capital  requirement  and low development  costs  (Seredkin  et al., 
2016),  a lower  surface  disturbance,  accessibility  to deep  ore bodies,  less dust and noise 
contamination and the option to process low -grade ores that would otherwise be 
considered  uneconomical.  Challenges  in ISR copper  operations  include  the prevention 
of groundwater  contamination,  ore accessibility  enhancement  and an understanding  of 
the required lixiviant solutions (Djordjevic,  2016).  
 
To be a suitable candidate for ISR exploitation, copper mineralisation should fulfil 
certain physico -chemical requirements. Copper mineralisation occurs in primary 
magmatic  ores,  secondary  enrichment  zones , and veins  in igneous  rocks  and sediments 
(Habashi, 1978). Based on their source and characteristics, copper deposits can be 
classified as sediment -hosted or porphyry copper deposits (Williamson, 1998). Most 
copper minerals are present as copper sulfides (chalcopyrite, bornite, chalcocit e and 
covellite) (Bulatovic, 2007) with primary copper -sulfide minerals (hypogene) being 
separated from the altered oxide zone (supergene) by a partially oxidised zone that is 
enriched in secondary copper -sulfide minerals. Hard -rock copper minerals, such a s 
chalcopyrite, represent more than 70% of global copper (Li et al.,  2013).  
 
Refractory  copper -sulfide  (chalcopyrite,  bornite,  chalcocite,  covellite)  deposits  may be 
candidates for ISR processing; such mineralisations may be low -grade (which makes 
them une conomical to process by conventional means) and usually exist at medium 
depths  (0.5 km) to depths  that exceeded  2 km (Wallace,  1979),  which  implies  that they 
are  located   deeper  than   ideal  open   pit  and   underground  targets   may  be.  The 
 
30 Chapter 1  
 
 
implementation of copper ISR has been applied mainly to porous ores, and no low - 
accessibility  hard-rock copper -sulfide  ores have  been  processed  by ISR. These  mineral 
types are more difficult to leach than oxide ores, and an understanding of the rock 
changes that result from fluid interaction is a key point to unlock their successful 
exploitation.  Unlike  oxide  minerals  that are soluble  in acid or alkaline  lixivi ants, in the 
hydrometallurgical processing of copper -sulfide minerals, an oxidant is necessary for 
sulfide oxidation to release copper into solution (Schlesinger et al ., 2011). 
Furthermore,  primary -sulfide  dissolution  from  primary  copper  sulfides  can show  slow 
leach kinetics (see Table  1-1).

1.1.1.1.  Mineral dissolution and fluid  stability  
 
An understanding of lixiviant/oxidant responses beyond the commonly studied 
temperature (and pressure) regimes may be required for execution of ISR. 
Uncontrollable changes in temperature and solution concentrations in an ISR 
environment may affect the solu tion pH and Eh, which could yield undesirable 
reactions  and result  in precipitate  formation.  Therefore,  an evaluation  of the efficiency 
of lixiviant systems should be conducted under conditions that replicate the ISR 
environment.

As chalcopyrite  is the most  abundant  copper  sulfide,  its successful  hydrometallurgical 
processing would be advantageous. Chalcopyrite leaching studies have attracted 
significant interest over the years. The most common oxidant that has been 
investigated  extensively  because  of its cost and availability  is ferric  sulfate  paired with 
sulfuric acid. When iron(III) is used as an oxidant, ideally, the complete oxidation of 
sulfide to sulfate and copper and iron release into solution by chalcopyrite dissolution 
should result (Equation 1).

A variety of other oxidants, acids and bases have been tested in hydrometallurgical 
processing. Oxidants include Cu2+, O 2, Cr 2O72₋, NO 3₋, H 2O2 and O 3 in sulfuric acid, 
hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, ammonium hydroxide and glycine 
(Antonijević et al., 1994; Aydogan et al., 2006; Beckstead and Miller, 1977; Córdoba 
et al., 2008;  Dutrizac  and Macdonald,  1978;  Dutrizac  et al., 1970;  Oraby  and Eksteen, 
2014; Ruiz et al., 2011; Shiers et al., 2016; Sokić et al., 2009; Velásquez -Yévenes et 
al., 2010) . Solutions have been tested under different conditions to evaluate their 
ability to extract copper from ores or concentrates. Test temperatures have been studied 
from room temperature to 90°C, with only a few studies exceeding 100°C (McDonald 
and Muir, 2007). ISR processing may be conducted at elevated temperatures (> 90°C) 
with restricted oxygen availability. To the author’s knowledge limited research  exists 
on the behaviour of these fluids and their impact on mineral dissolution and fluid 
stability under simulated ISR  conditions.  
 
 
1.1.1.2.  Reaction kinetics and  mechanisms  
 
Natural deposits are heterogeneous, and in an ISR operation, the targeting of value 
minerals only is difficult. Composite natural ores contain gangue and different  copper 
minerals,  which  makes  it difficult  to extrapolate  fundamental  kinetic  and mineralogical 
studies that are available in the literature. Possible interactions between phases i n 
targeted minerals may affect energy requirements for dissolution and enhance 
precipitation  rates  as a result  of re-equilibration.  The kinetic  analysis  of copper -sulfide 
dissolution  has been  studied  for pure concentrate  samples  (Ahn  et al., 2018;  Dreisinger 
and Abed,  2002;  Dutrizac,  1981;  Hirato  et al., 1987).  Because  beneficiation  is not 
 
32 Chapter 1  
 
 
possible in an ISR environment, an understanding of the kinetics of dissolution of 
natural gangue -containing samples is necessary.  
 
 
1.1.1.3.  Compositional and morphological  transformations  
 
Compared with tank, vat and heap leaching operations, ISR operation is challenging 
in terms of the control of leaching conditions. ISR requires a continuous flow of 
lixiviant along flow paths. The continuous interaction of the fluid and the rock 
produces p hysical and chemical changes (Williamson, 1998). The enhancement or 
reduction of permeability and porosity from sulfide dissolution or precipitation, 
respectively, has not been studied extensively, and to the author’s knowledge, only 
Yang et al. (2019) des cribed an increase in porosity in a low -grade chalcopyrite after 
leaching with ferric chloride solutions at 80°C. Porosity and permeability at the 
microscale can be compromised by the formation of surface layers that reduce the 
dissolution rate and, in the  worst scenario, cause the dissolution to cease. This 
phenomenon  has been  described  as “passivation”.  It has also been  suggested  that sulfur 
formation is responsible for the reduction in copper dissolution (Córdoba et al., 2009; 
Dutrizac, 1990). Therefore,  an analysis of the reacted solid is important to understand 
the reaction -driven solid change and to avoid the potential for pathway clogging or 
“short -circuiting”.  
 
 
1.1.1.4.  Low -grade ore dissolution and the effect of gangue  minerals  
 
Low-grade ores include highe r amounts of gangue minerals, which increases the 
possibility of side reactions, precipitation, acid consumption and an accumulation of 
cations and anions in solution (Sinclair and Thompson, 2015). Permeability may be 
affected as a result of gangue dissolu tion. The dissolution response of low -grade 
minerals under ISR conditions is not available in the literature.  
 
 
1.2. Research  objectives  
 
The aim of this research is to fill existing knowledge gaps by analysing and 
understanding  the fluid –rock interaction  of copper-sulfide  minerals  with a variety  of 
 
 
33 Chapter 1  
 
 
lixiviant/oxidant systems under expected ISR conditions. The specific objectives 
include:  
 
 
• To identify the extent and rates of mineral dissolution for common and non - 
standard lixiviant/oxidant solutions under ISR conditions, including an 
understanding of the dissolved species solubility and solution stability and its 
impact on copper recovery  rates. 
• To understand the interaction between the fluid and the rock 
(dissolution/precipitation behaviour) with a focus on the reaction mechanisms 
and kinetic behaviour for pure and composite  ores.  
• To understand the fluid -mediated compositional and morpholog ical 
transformations  of coarse  pieces  of copper  sulfides  by interaction  with different 
solutions (with and without oxidant), including secondary mineral formation 
and reaction products (iron precipitates, compact crystalline or  non-crystalline 
sulfur layer s, silica gel formation or hydroxide precipitation) at elevated 
temperatures (90°C to  170°C).  
• To identify the effect of gangue -related reactions on the rock morphology 
(precipitation) and its influence on solution  access.  
 
 
1.3. Significance  
 
In-situ recovery offers a step -change approach to the extraction of sub -surface values, 
when executed efficiently and effectively. The application depends on an appropriate 
knowledge of the target mineral system and the interaction of the said mineral syst em 
with the selected lixiviant system. The findings of this work present new information to 
contribute  to the design  of optimal  extraction/recovery  approaches  in future  ISR projects, 
which may include the lixiviant/oxidant selection, well spacing and initi al reagent 
concentrations.

1.4. Thesis outline and  publications  
 
This PhD thesis comprises seven chapters. Chapter 1 includes a general background 
on ISR and copper leaching from sulfide minerals, the research objectives and the 
significance  of the work.  Chapters  2 to 6 have  been  prepared  as individual  published, 
submitted or draft research papers. Additional information  
• Chapter 2 compares 11 lixiviant/oxidant solutions under similar conditions. 
Experiments were performed on coarse pieces of chalcopyrite at elevated 
temperatures and pressures. The copper -leaching behaviour with the different 
lixiviant systems has been described, and includes the product phases, fluid 
stability and copper -dissolution rate. As additional information a conference 
paper is presented in Appendix A with supplementary data for h igh temperature 
experiments.  
 
• Chapters 3 and 4 focus on understanding the kinetics of chalcopyrite and 
composite chalcopyrite/bornite sample leaching with an acidified ferric -chloride 
solution. In order to understand how the complexity of the samples affec ts the 
kinetical analysis and identify the best manner to approach composite samples 
(characteristic of ISR  targets).  
 
• Chapters 5 and 6 focus on the effect on solids under ISR operations, including 
deviations from ideal conditions (such as oxidant and acid  depletion) and the 
presence  of gangue.  In Chapter  5, the leaching  behaviour  of natural  copper -sulfide 
samples (bornite/chalcocite) is studied in acidic solutions in the absence of 
oxidant; rock transformation to copper -enriched phases occurred and possibl e 
explanations of the transformation mechanism are presented. As supplementary 
data about the reactivity of product layers resulting from mineral replacements is 
presented in Appendix B. In Chapter 6, a simulation of depleted acid conditions 
(as may occur in a real ISR scenario when fluid travels from the injection to 
recovery wells) was  presented.

Chapter 2. Comparative analysis of copper dissolution and mineral 
transformations in coarse chalcopyrite for different  lixiviant/oxidant 
systems at elevated temperature (110°C to  170°C)  
 
 
Chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) is the most common copper -bearing mineral and represents 
more than half of global copper mineral reserves. Copper sulfides, such as 
chalcopyrite, require oxidant addition for dissolution. Although numerous lixiviants 
have  been  evaluated  in previous  studi es for conventional  mining,  limited  information 
is available regarding their behaviour during the leaching of coarse chalcopyrite 
samples at high temperature, including their stabilities and secondary product 
formation. We compared the thermal stability of  eleven lixiviant/oxidant systems 
(sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ammonium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid and 
glycine, and oxidants, including iron (III), copper (II), dichromate, sodium nitrate, 
ammonium sulfate and hydrogen peroxide) and their abilit y to leach copper from 
chalcopyrite at 110°C (below the sulfur melting point) and 170°C (above the sulfur 
melting point) under similar conditions. Tests were conducted for up to 576 h using 
solid cuboids (4 -mm sides) to simulate in -situ recovery conditions . Sealed batch and 
Parr reactors  were  used to simulate  an anaerobic  environment  that may be experienced 
in a subterranean application. This paper presents the findings from this study and 
compares the leaching systems at 110°C and 170°C based on copper rel ease into 
solution,  product  identification,  passivation  phenomena  and an analysis  of superficial 
textures. The potential for use of the systems in deep -ore copper in -situ recovery 
processing is discussed based on the laboratory performance of the chosen  systems.  
 
 
2.1. Introduction  
 
 
Chalcopyrite leaching studies have attracted significant interest because of the 
abundance of this mineral globally and its dissolution is challenging under mild 
conditions. During the hydrometallurgical processing of copper -sulfide minerals 
(chalcopyrite,  bornite,  chalcocite  and covellite),  an oxidant  such as Fe3+  is used to 
 
 
42 Chapter 2  
 
 
release  copper  into solution  (Schlesinger  et al., 2011).  During  this reaction,  copper  and 
iron from chalcopyrite dissolve and product layers may form as a result of reaction. 
The selection  of a suitable  lixiviant  system  can enhance  the recovery  rate and  result  in 
an increase in revenue. A variety of commercially available oxidants paired wi th 
lixiviants (acid or base), including ferric ions and oxygen, cupric ions, dichromate, 
nitrate, hydrogen peroxide and ammonia persulfate, have been tested in the  laboratory 
under a range of conditions to assess their efficacy to extract copper from ores or 
concentrates. The most commonly investigated lixiviant system for chalcopyrite 
leaching is Fe3+ in sulfuric acid (Sinclair and Thompson,  2015).  
Thermal environments in in -situ recovery (ISR) may pose limits to fluid stability and 
undesired reactions wit h gangue minerals that may compromise the operation. An 
understanding of the lixiviant/oxidant response beyond common experimental 
temperature (< 90°C) (and atmospheric pressure) regimes may be required in an ISR 
environment. For example, temperatures are reported to increase 25 –30°C/km 
depending on the local geothermal gradient, and the increase in hydrostatic pressure 
with depth is approximately 10 MPa/km (Fridleifsson, 1996). For deep ore bodies (> 
2 km) the minimum temperature is hypothesised to exceed 60°C at greater than 20 
MPa. Although temperatures above 100°C may be uncommon for oxide zones, the 
existence  of temperatures  in this range  is possible  for primary  sulfide  ores.  Unenriched 
porphyry deposits of chalcopyrite have been found at Red Mountain ( Arizona) 
between 2 –4 km below the surface. Although these deposits are currently only of 
academic interest (Wallace, 1979), they are potential targets for ISR in the future. 
Therefore, an understanding of the stability of solutions for use at a high temper ature 
(> 100°C) is required. To the author’s knowledge, only McDonald and Muir (2007) 
have compared commercially proposed concentrate processing systems up to 225°C, 
and concluded that a variation in experimental parameters, such as pulp density, free 
acidity and the addition of sodium chloride, impacts sulfide conversion, phases in the 
leach residue and copper recovery. Studies above 225°C have been performed for 
ferric ions, oxygen and ammonia sulfate/carbonate solutions (Padilla et al., 2008; 
Turan and A ltundogan, 2013; Turan et al., 2015; Yu et al., 1973). No comparative 
analysis of different lixiviant/oxidant pairs under similar conditions is available in  the 
literature for temperatures above 100°C. A summary of available information for 
different leach ing systems is presented in Table  2-1. 
 
43 Chapter 2  
 
 
 
Even though several kinetics studies have been performed using common 
lixiviant/oxidant  pairs,  and extensive  research  exists  on the effect  of different  variables 
on the leaching behaviour of chalcopyrite, alternative systems, such as glycine 
(Eksteen  et al., 2017;  Oraby,  2014)  or methanesulfonic  acid (Ahn  et al., 2018;  Hidalgo 
et al., 2018), are still being investigated. Alkaline systems using glycine in alkaline 
media have been investigated for copper extraction at low temperatures. Hidalgo et al. 
(2018) reviewed the kinetic behaviour of chalcopyrite using MSA ferric solutions. 
However, limited information is available on the system leaching behaviour and  
product -layer formation for coarse grain sizes and leaches under  pressure.

In different leaching solutions, the initial solid undergoes several transformations that 
may result in the formation of product layers. The precipitation of surface layers that 
inhibit extraction is commonly termed “passivation” and has an important influ ence 
on the leaching rate. In some cases, product layers may restrict lixiviant access to the 
reaction interface. However, intermediate surface layer formation may be favourable 
for mineral dissolution if the resulting product phase is more porous than the  original 
mineral. The nature of passivating layers is not understood fully. Dutrizac (1990) and 
Harmer et al. (2006) found that elemental sulfur production (S 0) could cause 
passivation. However, Munoz et al. (1979), Hackl et al. (1995) and Dutrizac (1981a ) 
proposed  that iron-oxide  and -hydroxy  compounds  (e.g.,  hematite,  jarosite)  from  ferric 
hydrolysis prevent lixiviant access to the mineral surface. Lázaro and Nicol (2003) 
suggested that selective iron dissolution results in the formation of a less reacti ve 
copper -enriched layer (CuS) that slowed down the solid -state diffusion of copper and 
iron. However,  Nicol  and Zhang  (2017)  proposed  the formation  of a copper  polysulfide 
layer  (CuS 2) that grows  in thickness  as the reaction  continues  and reduces  the reaction 
rate. Other theories presented by Crundwell (2013) contradict the conception of 
polysulfides as responsible of passivation, arguing that no kinetical data has been 
presented to associate the rate reduction with the thickness of the layer. In a mor e 
detailed work Holmes and Crundwell (2013) concluded that polysulfide layer formed 
on pyrite  surface  did not passivate  it, the thickness  of the layer  increased  with potential 
along  with the pyrite  dissolution.  Textural  and morphological  surface  changes  that can 
influence porosity and permeability resulting from chemical reactions with lixiviant 
systems have not been reviewed for large grains and in different stages of  reaction.  
Parameters and conditions that affect the leaching rate and the forma tion of reaction 
products  in chalcopyrite  as related  to ISR conditions  have  not been  discussed.  A review 
of the relevant hydrometallurgical information of chalcopyrite leaching reveals 
numerous knowledge gaps on the analysis of leaching rates and reacted s olid 
characterisation for coarse sample leaching, exposure to high temperatures and under 
pressure  with low oxygen  availability.  As part of a global  effort  to unlock  the possible 
application of ISR to copper sulfides, this study focuses on understanding fl uid and 
solid transformations for the dissolution of coarse chalcopyrite samples by  comparing 
various leaching systems under possible ISR conditions.

2.2. Materials and  methods  
 
2.2.1.  Samples  
 
Natural chalcopyrite rocks without a particular origin were cut in cuboid pieces of ~4 
mm × 4 mm × 4 mm. The cuboids were polished to obtain flat surfaces and defined 
edges.  Initial  solids  were  characterised  by the digestion  of 8 g of milled  cuboid  pieces.  
2.2.2.  Analytical  techniques  
 
Unreacted and reacted solids were analysed by using various analytical techniques.  
 
2.2.2.1.  X-ray diffraction  
 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were collected for cuboid samples in epoxy mounts, 
by using a PANalytical Empyrean X -ray diffract ometer with a Bragg –Brentano HD 
incident monochromator equipped with cobalt X -ray tube operated at 40 kV and 40 
mA. The system optics consisted of a diffracted beam pixel three dimensions (3D) 
array detector in scanning one dimension (1D) mode with 0.125° antiscatter slit and  
0.02 rad soller  slits. The scanning  range  was from  3° to 120°  with a 2 h scanning  time. 
Phase mineral identification was performed using PANalytical High Score Plus  3.0d.  
2.2.2.2.  Scanning electron and optical  microscopy  
 
Reacted  solids  were  mounted  on stubs  and analysed  by scanning  electron  microscopy - 
energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM -EDS). Cuboids were set in epoxy mounts and 
polished. Samples were carbon coated to avoid surface charging. Cross -sections were 
analysed by optical microscopy with a Nikon Eclipse EV100N POL light optical 
microscope. Scanning electron microscopy was performed usi ng a JEOL -JSM-7001 
instrument  with 10 mm silicon  drift detector,  EDS  detector  and a resolution  of 125 eV 
for chemical composition and elemental map distributions, at 20 kV with an 8 to 10 
mm working  distance.  
2.2.2.3.  Quantitative Evaluation of Minerals by Scanning Electron  Microscopy  
 
Mineralogical analysis was performed using a E430 Pro Quantitative Evaluation of 
Minerals by Scanning Electron Microscopy (QEMSCAN) instrument and an  internal  
 
 
48 Chapter 2  
 
 
CSIRO protocol for mineral identification (Meyer et al., 2013). The final data were 
processed with FEI Idiscover 5.2 software. Cross -sectional mineralogical maps were 
obtained using a Tescan Mira3 SEM instrument with EDAX X -ray detectors and 
TIMA Tescan so ftware V1.6.65. The system was operated at 25 kV and 7.29 nA; and 
data were collected with a 4 -µm step size across the sample and with a 0.5 -µm step 
size on selected areas.  
2.2.2.4.  Solid porosity and permeability  analysis  
 
One cuboid pre - and post -leaching was sub mitted for X -ray computed tomography 
(CT) scanning to identify reaction -induced changes using a XRADIA Zeiss Versa 
XRM  520 3D-X ray microscope  (160 kV, 9 W and voxel  size of 3 µm).  A total of 1601 
projections  were  recorded  for each scan over a 360°  sample  rotation  and were  used for 
volume  reconstruction.  An approximation  of sample  volume  and porosity  changes  was 
achieved by using changes in sample volume and surface area (because the voxel  size 
was kept constant for both  scans).  
The volumes were proc essed with Thermo scientific Avizo 2019 -2 software and in - 
house workflows (Godel, 2013). To compare changes in fractures and void space 
between different samples, cross -sections (110°C) were analysed by using ImageJ  1.x 
(a public -domain  image -processing  software  that allows  for image  area measurements 
(Schneider et al., 2012)). Measurements of void space were compared with unreacted 
samples to obtain a percentage change that occurred during  reaction.  
 
 
2.2.2.5.  Fluid analysis  
 
Fluids were analysed and elemental concentrations (Cu, Fe and S) were measured by 
inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. pH and Eh (Ag/AgCl) 
values were obtained with Ionode ORP and pH (IJ44A and IJ64) combination 
electrodes. Glycine sol utions were analysed by Fourier -transform infrared 
spectroscopy (FTIR) using a Bruker Vertex 70 instrument to confirm total 
decomposition by using unreacted glycine solution as a standard and MilliQ water as 
a blank. The working parameters were a spectral region of 800 –4000 cm₋1 and a 
resolution of 4 cm₋1.

2.2.3.  Leaching  tests  
 
The release of copper from chalcopyrite dissolution (referred to as copper dissolution 
in the rest of the tex t) was compared at 110°C (below the sulfur melting point) and 
170°C (above the sulfur melting point) for different acid or alkaline lixiviant systems 
with a known oxidant. Initial screening showed that glycine decomposition to 
ammonia started to occur abov e 60°C and, therefore, this temperature was used in 
subsequent  experiments  (O2 and H2O2). Lower -temperature  experiments  (110°C)  were 
performed in a 300 mL Parr® reactor, model 5521, with associated temperature 
controller  (Fig.  2-1a), because  of the possibility  of gas release  during  the test, to allow 
oxygen injection as required and to enable fluid samples to be taken for kinetic plots.  
High -temperature experiments (170°C) were performed in closed stainless -steel 
reactors (batch reactors) with selected lixiviants only (i.e., those that would not 
generate gas). The experimental reaction times were extended for the 170°C tests to 
establish  whether  the solid  composition  changed  more  extensively  and whether  copper 
dissolution  increased.  Multiple  reactors  were  used to acquire  solid  samples  at different 
reaction  times.  Copper  extraction  was calculated  based  on the average  mineralogy  and 
initial copper concentration in the blank solids after QEMSCAN and ICP -OES 
analysis. Screening experiments showed a copper dissolution variation of ± 3.5% 
because of sample  heterogeneity.  
At 110°C, ten solutions were tested under “initial standard cond itions” (Table 2 -2). 
Concentrations were chosen based on a literature review of previous experiments on 
fine-grained samples and showed optimal conditions for each oxidant/lixiviant (see 
Table 2 -1). Experiments were conducted in the Parr® reactor with cons tant agitation 
at 150 rpm by a magnetically driven impeller. The solid was placed in the vessel, 
covered with 150 mL of solution, closed, and residual oxygen was flushed with 1000 
kPa of industrial -purity nitrogen three times at ambient conditions. Once th e reactor 
had reached  the desired  temperature,  solution  samples  (2–4 mL) were  taken  at 4 h and 
 
 
50 Chapter 2  
 
 
over four days of the reaction. When sampling, the first fluid volume was discarded 
(to flush the sampling port) and the second fluid volume was retained for analysis. 
Leachates were filtered and diluted. Solid samples were taken at one and four days, 
rinsed with deionised water and dried at 30°C for further analysis.

At 170°C, six solutions were selected from the original group based on their 
performance, common use in the industry or uniqueness (alternative to common 
oxidants/lixiviants, such as potassium dichromate or glycine). Extended times and 
higher concentration s were chosen based on stoichiometric calculations from initial 
solid masses and assuming 100% chalcopyrite dissolution, with conditions provided 
in Table  2-3. Experiments  were  conducted  with solid  cuboids  and 5 mL of fluid  in 10- 
mL Teflon -lined closed st ainless -steel reactors (Fig. 2 -1b). Air was flushed from the 
vessels by using nitrogen before the reactor was closed and placed in a standard 
convection oven. Each batch reactor was used as a unique data point to obtain solid 
samples weekly over a three -week period.

2.3.1.  Initial sample  characterisation  
 
The unreacted cuboid samples contained chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) (85.8% ± 5%) and 
pyrite (FeS 2) (11.5% ± 4%) (Fig. 2 -2a) with small dispersed zones of quartz (SiO 2) 
(1.6% ± 1.3%) and magnetite (Fe 3O4) (0.1% ± 0.1%) (Fig. 2 -3) (numbers based on 
QEMSCAN mass%). The solid surfaces were smooth with well -defined edges, no 
sulfur or oxidation products and small surface fractures (Fig. 2 -2b). Sample cross - 
sections showed uniform compositions of chalcopyrite (close to the theoretical 
chalcopyrite  composition  ± 1% copp er, Fig. 2-2c). Table  2-4 shows  the average  sample 
chemical composition that was obtained from a bulk sample of milled cuboids from 
the original bulk rock. The Cu, Fe and S contents between analysed samples differed 
by less than  2%.

2.3.2.  Fluid analysis  
 
 
At 110°C, copper extractions for the K 2Cr2O7+HCl (100% copper extracted after 72 
h), FeCl 3+HCl (86% copper extraction after 98 h), CuCl 2+HCl (63% copper  extracted 
after 98 h) and NaNO 3+H 2SO 4 (40% copper extracted after 98 h) lixiviant systems 
were highest. Other systems reached lower maximum copper extractions, and all 
reached  a plateau  over the experimental  time period.  The lowest  values  were  found  for 
H2O2+H 2SO 4 (10% copper extracted after 98 h) and O 2+glycine (6% copper  extracted 
after 98 h). The kinetic data are shown in Fig.  2-4a. 
 
Alkaline solutions (H 2O2+glycine) showed a maximum of 2% copper dissolution, 
which was 4% less than that with O 2 as oxidant (both solutions were tested at 60°C). 
Iron dissolved  in all acid solutions  (data  not shown)  but was relatively  insoluble  in the 
alkaline systems (< 0.5% iro n dissolved).

Chapter 2  
 
 
At 170°,  the copper  dissolution  (Fig.  2-4b) improved  or decreased  in different  systems. 
The chloride -containing systems proved most effective; 100% and 80% copper 
dissolution was achieved by the FeCl 3+HCl and CuCl 2+HCl systems, respectively, 
after 560 h. The CuSO 4+H 2SO 4 and Fe 2(SO 4)3+H 2SO 4 systems achieved a maximum 
of 50% copper dis solution after 360 h. The K 2Cr2O7+HCl system was sensitive to the 
high temperature and achieved only 5% copper dissolution after 120  h.

2.3.3.  Solids  analysis  
 
2.3.3.1.  Product -layer  formation  
 
The reduction  in copper  dissolution  that occurred  in several  of the solutions  tested  may 
be related  to surface  passivation.  Important  features  related  to product -layer  formation 
were  evidenced  by  solid  characterisation.  Presented  phases  were  confirmed  by 
 
 
 
55 
Chapter 2  
 
 
chemical composition and crystal information (XRD, SEM -EDS, QEMSCAN,  TIMA 
and optical  microscopy).  
 
 
2.3.3.1.1.  Sulfur  layers  
 
Sulfur (S0), as the most common phase in the acid systems at 110°C was the product 
of incomplete  sulfide  oxidation  (Fig.  2-5). Dutrizac  (1990) found  that sulfur  is present 
as 95% of the product composition compared with the 5% sulfate when chalcopyrite 
is dissolved in ferric -chloride solutions. Sulfur layers show different textures in the 
presence of chloride compared with sulfate -reacted solids. Sulfur formed in chl oride 
solutions showed a porous texture with zones of chalcopyrite exposed for fluid 
interaction,  as was presented  by Hidalgo  et al. (2018).  A similar  conclusion  was made 
by Parker et al. (2008) who found by using Raman spectrometry that sulfur formed in 
sulfate  solutions  had longer  sulfur –sulfur  bonds  and a tighter  remnant  lattice  compared 
with chloride solutions. Our results indicate that changes in sulfur textures and 
morphologies result when solutions of different chemical composition are used under 
similar Eh –pH conditions. Sulfur textures and morphologies at 110°C for different 
solutions varied (Fig. 2 -5). Chloride solutions (FeCl 3+HCl and CuCl 2+HCl), 
potassium dichromate (K 2Cr2O7+HCl) and sodium nitrate (NaNO 3+H 2SO 4) showed 
the most  porous  globular  texture  (Fig.  2-5a, c and e), which  was matched  with a higher 
total copper dissolution. Sulfur that formed in methanesulfonate, ferric -sulfate and 
hydrogen -peroxide solutions showed tighter sulfur layers with an amorphous 
appearance. Based on this observation, sulfur passivation may differ for different 
acidic  solutions and be based on the chemistry of the fluid used. The sulfur morphology 
changed during different stages of reaction, which changed the dissolution kinetics, as 
was evidenced previously for bornite leaching (Hidalgo et al., 2019a).  
The sulfur char acteristics differed for the experiments at 170°C. Mobile molten  sulfur 
allowed for an increased fracture penetration by the lixiviant and an enhanced 
dissolution  rate resulted  for the sulfate  solutions.  The sulfur  became  impermeable  upon 
cooling.

surface  texture.  
 
 
2.3.3.1.2.  Copper -enrichment  layers  
 
 
Many systems showed sulfur as the sole product, but copper -enrichment layers were 
also present as product layers that coated the sample perimeter except when ferric ion 
was used as an oxidant.  Of these  product  phases,  digenite  (Cu 1.8S), covellite  (CuS)  and 
bornite (Cu 5FeS 4) were most common (Fig. 2 -6). Copper -enrichment layers resulted 
at different solution potentials (375 mV to 1062 mV vs SHE) and in alkaline to acid 
solutions. Solutions with high initial concentrations of cupric ions showed a 
preferential  formation  of digenite  rims (CuCl 2+HCl  and CuSO 4+H 2SO 4). The resulting 
phases  showed  extensive  growth  with an increase  in temperature  (Fig.  2-6a and b), but 
a modest  increase  resulted  at 110°C.  The product  layers  started  forming  in fractures  
 
 
57 
Chapter 2  
 
 
and zones with fluid access. More and deeper fractures were found when the 
replacement  thickness  was significant;  the newly  formed  copper  phase  showed  a more 
porous  texture,  as was also identified  by Muszer  et al. (2013)  and Zhao  et al. (2014)  in 
copper layers formed after chalcopyrite and bornite replacements. Leaching of the 
copper -enriched phase (CuS) enhanced copper extraction and did not hinder further 
chalcopyrite dissolution as was also evidenced in our results and prev ious work 
(Hidalgo et al., 2019b). Some copper -enrichment layers were coated by other 
precipitates that may hinder lixiviant/oxidant access (Fig.2 - 6c and d). In these cases, 
the phase showed slow growth after the total reaction  extent.  
The formation of co pper-enrichment phases may be related to higher concentrations 
of Cu2+ and Fe2+ in solution from chalcopyrite oxidation and an associated reduction 
in Fe+3 concentration. Hiroyoshi et al. (2000) found that chalcocite phases formed 
when  chalcopyrite  leached  in the presence  of ferrous  ions,  and the resulting  phase  was 
more reactive than the original chalcopyrite. The reaction of chalcopyrite in the 
presence of copper sulfate resulted in the formation of  digenite:

2.3.3.1.3.  Iron oxides  
 
 
Alkaline solutions were the only systems that yielded iron -oxide product layers. 
(NH 4)2SO 4+NH 4OH+Na 2S2O8 solutions produced a loose layer of iron precipitates 
(identified as hematite by XRD) (Equation 2) with an underlying thin rim of bornite 
(Fig. 2 -6d). The bornite layer increased in thickness at higher temperatures or with 
time and showed  a distinctive  chemical  border  with original  chalcopyrite.  Similar  
59 
Chapter 2  
 
 
products were found by Warren and Wadsworth (1984) that evidenced a slowdown  in 
copper dissolution and was attributed to Cu 1-xFeS 2 beneath the iron -oxide layers. 
Solids leached with O 2 or H 2O2+glycine solutions formed similar iron -oxide layers 
(Fig.  2-7a) but no copper  enrichment  was found  (Fig.  2-7b). Our results  show  different 
products for different systems when the same pH (10.5) was used 
((NH 4)2SO 4+NH 4OH+Na 2S2O8 and O 2+glycine), which indicates the influence of 
solution chemistry on solid products as wa s also seen in acid solution. Halpern et al. 
(1959) compared copper dissolution between ammonia and glycine solutions. 
Ammonia had a higher kinetic rate constant (84 mg cm-2 h-1(mol L-1)-1 for ammonia vs 
49 mg cm-2 h-1(mol L-1)-1 for glycine). The stabilit y of the Cu+2 complexes was higher 
in glycine compared with ammonia (4.3 logK 1 for ammonia vs 8.4 logK 1 for glycine) 
Therefore, copper appears to be more soluble in glycine solutions (Aksu and Doyle, 
2001). The different solids may result from the solubili ty and stability differences 
between solutions that result in copper reprecipitation in the form of bornite.  
CuFeS 2 + 4NH 3 + 4.25O 2 +2OH- →Cu  (NH 3)42+ +0.5Fe 2O3 +2SO 42- +H 2O (2) 
 
The iron -oxide precipitates were loosely packed and fractures surrounded the 
precipitates with gaps between the iron and copper phases (chalcopyrite for glycine 
and a bornite  surface  layer  for ammonia).  Cracks  increased  in length  only when  pyrite 
was not p resent (the pyrite surface was oxidised with a thin layer of iron -oxide 
reprecipitation). Based on these results, no evidence exists for passivation because of 
iron precipitate formation (also proposed by (Moyo et al. , 2015). Therefore, the low 
copper diss olution may be related to oxidant availability (low solubility under 
temperature  conditions).

2.3.3.1.4.  Other  phases  
 
 
The potassium dichromate (K 2Cr2O7+HCl) residue at 170°C showed copper 
enrichment (covellite (CuS)) and chromium - and iron -oxide precipitation as (Cr 2O3) 
and hematite  (Fe 2O3), respectively  (Fig.  2-6c). The products  showed  complex  layering 
inside  the cracks  and around  the surface  perimeter  (Fig.  2-8b). Copper  dissolution  was 
hindered by passivation at this temperature, and was 5% at 170°C compared with the 
100% copper dissolution at 110°C. Similarly, a major reduction in copper dissolution 
was found  by Murr  and Hiskey  (1981)  in copper  dissolution  from  chalcopyrite  at 90°C 
with 0.05 mol L-1 potassium dichromate solutions, and was claimed to result from 
decreasing Cr(VI) absorption at the mineral surface. Our 11 0°C results are consistent 
with the solids reported by Murr and Hiskey (1981) and showed sulfur as the sole 
product.  The formation  of chromium -oxide  (Cr 2O3) at a higher  pH (pH 3) when  Cr(VI) 
is reduced  to Cr(III)  was evidenced  by Cruz -Espinoza  et al. (2012)  with the absorption 
of Cr 2O3 in activated carbon. Eskoliate (α -Cr2O3) was formed after calcination of the 
loaded carbon product at 1100°C. Our XRD results showed the formation of Cr 2O3 
(Fig. 2 -8a) that could be assumed as a precursor phase to the fo rmation of  eskolaite.

Formation  of chromium -oxide  or eskolaite  was suggested  by the stability  diagrams  for 
potassium -dichromate solutions (modelled by using Geochemist’s Workbench® at 
25°C, 110°C and 170°C; Fig. 2 -9). Eskoliate precipitation is proposed at room 
temperature for pH > 2 and Eh < 1 V. The stability region for the Cr3+ aqueous  phase 
decreases with increasing temperature; at 170°C, precipitation occurs over the entire 
pH range as was evidenced by the solid analysis (our experimental pH was <  1).

FeCl 3+HCl  Only sulfur formed. Solid, porous 
and brittle sulfur replaced major 
portions of chalcopyrite without 
covering the entire surface. Surface 
cracks formed.  The cuboid had dissolved, and only 
dense molten sulfur was present.  
CuCl 2+HCl  Sulfur replaced chalcopyrite as 
uneven patches around the pyrite 
particles.  Copper -enrichment phases in the 
form of digenite (Cu 1.8S) appeared 
as a major replacement of the 
chalcopyrite (rims 167 μm) with 
major surface cracks. External 
digenite rim converted to porous 
sulfur.  
Fe2(SO 4)3+H 2SO 4 After four days, sulfur formed 
isolated zones of tight, thin (< 1 μm) 
layers. No product was found 
internally, and sulfur penetration  was 
shallow.  Molten sulfur recrystallised in 
cracks and rims as tight sulfur 
layers (maximum thickness 27 
μm). No porous t exture resulted.  
CuSO 4+H 2SO 4 A total surface replacement of  
chalcopyrite by digenite (Cu 1.8S) 
occurred. Cross -sections showed a 
thin (1.5 μm) replacement rim.  Chalcopyrite was covered by a 
layer  of digenite  (Cu 1.8S) with a 70- 
μm-thick rim. Fractures formed 
only near the replacement  rim.

as a thin even rim (5 μm) and 
occurred inside cracks as fine

2.3.3.1.5.  Mechanisms of mineral transformation  
 
 
Characterisation indicated that product formation was dependent on pH and Eh and 
was influenced  significantly  by fluid  chemistry,  as evidenced  by the different  products  
 
64 Chapter 2  
 
 
that formed under similar pH and Eh conditions. Product phases (“leached layers”) 
result  from  the selected  removal  of ions from  the structure  conserving  the morphology 
and structure of the mineral (e.g., iron removal from chalcopyrite leaving bornite as 
product) (Burkin, 1969). Therefore, chemical gradients exist in solid rims and 
transformations occur by interaction of the fluid with the grain  boundaries. Crundwell 
(2015)  also presented  a different  understanding  of chalcopyrite  dissolution  mechanism 
in whi ch the dissolution behaviour is directly related to the n -type semiconductor 
structure  and the preferential  dissolution  was attributed  to the weak  bound  of iron with 
the surface because of its association with the anti -bonding orbitals of the valence 
band. However, in the course of the reaction the stoichiometric dissolution conditions 
will prevail.  
Differing from the vision of preferential dissolution of species as the dissolution 
mechanism of sulfides a new mechanism for mineral transformation to copper - 
enriched phases has been proposed (Cai et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2014). The mechanism 
is called interfacial coupled dissolution –reprecipitation (ICDR) and sugge st that the 
formation  of deficient  layer  obey  to re-equilibration  processes  between the interfacial 
fluid and the solid in the mineral interface. The concept of interfacial – coupled 
dissolution –reprecipitation (ICDR) has been explained as a re -equilibratio n process 
that occurs when a solid is out of equilibrium with a fluid, starts to dissolve 
stoichiometrically and when the interfacial fluid becomes supersaturated , a product 
phase  is precipitated  (Putnis,  2002;  Putnis,  2009).  The main  features  of this mech anism 
include: 1) a preservation of the initial morphology, 2) a sharp chemical interface 
between the parent and product, 3) development of porosity and permeability, 4) 
crystal  information  of the parent  is inherent  in the product.  Unlike  solid -state diffusion, 
this mechanism is related closely to chemical variability where the most important 
chemistry is that of the interfacial layer that is formed between the parent and  product 
phases.  Our results  suggest  that ICDR  may be the mechanism  for formation  of several 
phases that were present after leaching. Features that correlate with this mechanism 
include: (i) the replacement of chalcopyrite by porous digenite or bornite, (ii) the 
product phase showed a sharp chemical interface (confirmed by E DS line 
measurements) (Fig. 2 -10a and c) and (iii) variability in product solids depending on 
interfacial  chemistry  of the fluid  even  in solutions  with similar  pH and Eh range  (such 
as in the glycine and ammonia solutions) (Fig. 2 -10b and  c).

2.3.4.1.  Gangue  dissolution  
 
 
Selective  dissolution  of value  metal  over gangue  mineral  dissolution  is important  when 
mining low -grade ores to maximise economic recovery and avoid possible side 
reactions. In this study, gangue minerals included pyrite and minor quantities of 
magnetite. Pyrite dissolution was slower than chalcopyrite d issolution, as was noted 
previously by Chandra and Gerson (2010). Pyrite transformation to sulfur was 
achieved by using the strongest oxidants at 110°C, such as FeCl 3+HCl and 
K2Cr2O7+HCl  (Fig.  2-11). In contrast,  alkaline  solutions  showed  a low interaction  with 
the gangue. Surface analysis indicated that a loose thin layer of iron oxide formed on 
top of pyrite pieces but disappeared after cross -sectional polishing. The interaction 
with gangue may be advantageous (for example, pyrite may enhance c opper leaching 
by increasing the fluid progress into the core, as was presented by Dutrizac et al. 
(1971)), or be detrimental (such as reagent consumption in carbonate dissolution 
(Sinclair and Thompson, 2015)), depending on the gangue type. In this study,  pyrite 
dissolution was considered advantageous and increased the extent of fractures when 
dissolved.

2.3.4.2.  Accessibility  enhancement  
 
 
Experiments with CuCl 2+HCl solutions showed an increase in sample porosity that 
was recorded by various techniques (SEM, CT, and TIMA). The sample leached in 
CuCl 2+HCl at 170°C showed major fracturing after the original chalcopyrite was 
transformed into digenite (Fig. 2 -12). Re placement started by an expansion of the 
original microfractures, which increased the reaction pathways. The newly formed 
phase had a porous texture (SEM analysis), and no passivation behaviour was 
evidenced in the copper -dissolution plot (Fig. 2 -4b).

CT scans were conducted pre - and p ost-leaching to determine the development of 
porosity and volume changes in cuboids leached with CuCl 2+HCl solution for four 
days at 110°C. Only brittle sulfur replaced chalcopyrite and was evident in the upper 
face of the cuboid  (Fig.  2 -13a and b). Chal copyrite showed  morphological  changes  
 
68 
Chapter 2  
 
 
and a rough texture (Fig. 2 -13c and d). Pyrite did not show changes in morphology 
(Fig. 2 -13e and f). These changes occur as dissolution at the sample surface (i.e., all 
changes are related to the sample destruction and created porosity that is connected  to 
the outer sample surface). The registered porosity increase was 10.3% with a 95.6% 
increase  in surface  area.  The change  in surface  area was a good  proxy  for the increased 
sample surface complexity as leaching  progresses.  
 
Analysis of the void space in SE M cross -sectional images showed that the cuboid in 
the K2Cr2O7+HCl  solutions  dissolved  completely,  the next highest  change  in void area 
(20%) resulted for the FeCl 3+HCl system and the lowest change occurred for the 
Fe2(SO 4)3+H 2SO 4 and Fe(MSA) 3 solutions (1% and 3%, respectively). Alkaline 
solutions showed changes in void space between 12% (O 2+glycine) and 18% 
((NH 4)2SO 4+NH 4OH+Na 2S2O8) (See Fig. 2 -15 accessibility  enhancement).

2.3.5.  Implications for  ISR 
 
 
Many of the results obtained in this study have relevance to the choice of a lixiviant 
system (see Fig. 2 -14) for use in an ISR applicati on. 
2.3.5.1.  Lixiviant/oxidant temperature  stability  
 
 
Temperature  influences  the (i) pregnant  leach  solution  stability  (leads  to precipitation) 
and (ii) lixiviant decomposition rates and oxidant solubility. The precipitation of 
secondary phases that can passivate mineral surfaces may result from an increase in 
temperature (with all other conditions remaining the same), as was eviden ced in the 
K2Cr2O7+HCl system by the formation of an impermeable Cr 2O3 layer (eskolaite 
precursor).  Although  no jarosite  phases  formed  in our experiments,  a similar  behaviour 
(iron hydrolysis) occurs with an increase in temperature (Dutrizac, 1982; Hidalgo et 
al., 2019b).  Precipitation  could  be detrimental  to ISR operation  because  of passivation 
and fracture clogging, as was seen in the Cr 2O3 layer. This precipitation  might be 
irreversible if formed in ore at ISR conditions because of the resistance to corrosion 
and to high thermal stress that make it insoluble in acid at elevated temperatures 
(Routschka and Wuthnow,  2008).  
 
Reagents in the H 2O2+H 2SO 4, (NH 4)2SO 4+NH 4OH+ Na2S2O8 and H 2O2+glycine 
systems decomposed and became less soluble at a higher temperature. A pressure 
increase of up to 400 kPa resulted because of oxidant decomposition. Hydrogen 
peroxide  decomposition  is accelerated  above  60°C  and in the presence  of metal  cations 
(Agacayak et al., 2014; Chiriţǎ, 2007). With an increase in temperature, ammonium - 
hydroxide vapour pressure is increased (Bell et al., 1995). The nitrate stability 
diagrams show the production of NO 2 and N 2 gases at moderate Eh ( > 0.5 V) and above 
110°C (Shiers, 2016). Evidence for glycine decomposition occurred in the 
H2O2+glycine solution screening stages with chalcopyrite at 170°C and in fluid 
stability  tests (no chalcopyrite)  at 90°C,  110°C,  130°C  and 170°C;  FTIR  fluid  analysi s 
showed  that no glycine  was present  in the final solutions.  Reagent  decomposition  
 
71 Chapter 2  
 
 
increased when hydrogen peroxide was used, as has been documented elsewhere 
(Berger et al., 1999; Tanda, 2017). Gas dissolvers may be required should hydrogen 
peroxide and ammonia decomposition occur, such as those proposed by Litz (1982), 
to avoid a reduc tion in reaction rate, but dissolver addition may be costly. Although 
low        copper        dissolutions        resulted        for    the       H2O2+H 2SO 4 and 
(NH 4)2SO 4+NH 4OH+Na 2S2O8 systems at high temperature, high recoveries were 
obtained in other s tudies below 100°C for fine -grained solids (Agacayak et al., 2014; 
Beckstead and Miller, 1977). In an ISR operation, fluid decomposition to a low - 
solubility  gas could  affect  copper  dissolution,  present  a mechanical  hazard,  block  pores 
or channels, affect well casings or production tubing by cavitation and pose a health 
risk. 
 
2.3.5.2.  Accessibility  enhancement  
 
In an ISR operation, to improve fluid contact, accessibility to the minerals of interest 
in the ore may need to be enhanced. To achieve access, industry has focused on 
artificial processes, such as blasting (Sekisov and Lavrov, 2019), hydraulic fracturing 
and low-energy  technologies  (De Silva  et al., 2018).  Lixiviant  interaction  with the rock 
may also enhance accessibility by volume changes or mineral replacement by more 
permeable phases, as evidenced from the previously discussed solid analyses. To 
ensure effective mass transport, effective porosity is required. Therefore, the pore 
geomet ry, distribution and connectivity of the resulting porosity in product phases  are 
important to determine possible flow interruptions (Nikkhou et al., 2019). Reaction - 
induced porosity has been evidenced by Putnis (2015) from ICDR, which proposes 
that a tra nsient porosity forms because of the fluid –rock chemical re -equilibration 
process  that allows  for continuous  fluid –rock interaction  between  the parent  phase  and 
the fluid.  This porosity  may heal with time,  as was evidenced  by Hidalgo  et al. (2019a) 
in born ite sulfur layers, which may provide an explanation for the plateau stages that 
were reached for certain solutions after product -layer formation and growth ceased. 
An increase in void space and surface area by solid transformation through the 
formation of product phases (e.g., sulfur, copper -enrichment phases) and gangue 
dissolution increases the accessibility of the target mineral and may supplement 
mechanical  enhancement.  
 
 
72 Chapter 2  
 
 
2.3.5.3.  Environmental  impact  
 
 
Subsurface water contamination and the undesired interaction of leach solutions with 
the environment must be avoided in ISR. Despite achieving good copper extraction, 
some systems may impact the environment, especially at elevated temperatures. For 
example , alkaline (NH 4)2SO 4+NH 4OH+Na 2S2O8 solution is volatile, produces 
ammonia gas, is poisonous to aquatic life even at low concentrations and its toxicity 
increases with temperature and pH because of ammonia ionisation (NH 4+), which 
causes cellular damage in fish (Levit, 2010). Ammonia has an unpleasant smell, and 
gas leaks may be toxic to plant life and to respiratory and skin systems (Minesota, 
2019; Tanda, 2017). Although the best dissolution resulted for the K 2Cr2O7+HCl 
system, this reagent may pose severa l environmental issues in an ISR operation 
because  of its high toxicity  in water  sources.  Therefore,  the use of these  reagents  is not 
recommended for ISR where subsurface water may contact the fluid and the 
temperature exceeds 30°C. The O 2+glycine system poses the best environmental 
option, as the most common amino acid with a low environmental hazard to humans, 
aquatic life and plan ts. However, when NaOH is used in solution to maintain pH, the 
environmental  hazard  increases  and, in the same  manner,  the environmental  advantage 
is lost if the working temperature does not remain below 60°C due to decomposition 
to ammonia.

Optimum temperature and pH ranges for the different reagent systems were based on 
the fluid  and solid  analysis  after the experiments.  These  data are relevant  to fluid –rock 
interactions  at high temperatures  and to coarse  particle  sizes,  both of which  are relevant 
to ISR (which may also occur in a pressurised environment with limited oxygen 
availability). The ranges were determined based on the thermal stability, possible 
reaction products formed and optimum copper dissolut ion. The recommended ranges 
for primary sulfide dissolution by the different lixiviants tested are presented in Fig. 2 -
14; these  ranges  may be increased  or decreased  based  on target  mineral  analysis  and 
will be specific to each ISR  application.

Fig. 2 -14 Optimal temperature and pH conditions for 11 fluid solutions tested. Showing the 
optimal working windows to obtain maximum copper recovery without thermal instability or 
major precipitations. Acid solutions show an optimal pH range between 0 and 3, and alk aline 
solutions between 8 and 12.  
 
Based on the experimental results and literature analysis, seven categories were used 
to compare the systems tested in this study in terms of their suitability to coarse - 
chalcopyrite -particle leaching under possible ISR conditions (Fig. 2 -15). The 
categories  included  1) copper  dissolution  at 110°C  and 170°C;  2) temperature  stability 
when  considering  the fluid  decomposition  and product  precipitation;  3) environmental 
impact based on safety, possible gas production, biodegr adability, extended human 
exposure and corrosion; 4) selectivity based on gangue pyrite dissolution; 5) 
passivation behaviour based on product -layer -formation morphology, texture and 
effect on copper dissolution; 6) accessibility enhancement from fracture and porosity 
analysis of the superficial textures and cross -sections and 7) reagent  costs.  
Fluid selection can be based on the requirements for specific applications. For 
example, if copper dissolution and the reaction -related enhancement of initial 
permeability  are important,  the best lixiviant  option  would  be the FeCl 3+HCl  solution. 
Based  on the solid  transformations,  CuSO 4 oxidant  increased  the copper  content  of the 
solid  instead  of dissolving  it, and therefore,  this oxidant  may need  to be combined  with 
other oxidants  to  be effective.  The initial  transformation  did  no t show passivation  
74 
Chapter 2  
 
 
behaviour  and could  be used as a tenor  enhancement  into a more  reactive  solid  to avoid 
chalcopyrite passivation with the second -stage oxidant. However, this implies extra 
time and cost. In an ISR scenario, the injection of mixed oxidants in stages with 
"soaking" times would facilitate the interaction of the injected oxidant and the 
recovered copper as part of the leaching system. It is important to understand the 
required reaction times of the systems with the intention of extrapolating these data  to 
operational times. The reactions of chalcopyrite even above 170°C are slow. The 
“altern ative” systems provided similar results to the “common” systems in industry 
and therefore, reagent selection will depend on other aspects, such as environmental 
concerns or  costs.  
The Fe 2(SO 4)3+H 2SO 4 system, which is most common conventionally, showed 
disadvantageous behaviour for most criteria (Fig. 2 -15). However, this system 
provides  the best option  if cost reduction  is the most  critical  constraint.  ISR operations 
have  several  cost advantages,  such as a reduction  in capital  investment  compared  with 
conventional  methods.  ISR-associated  costs  depend  mainly  on the achieved  flow rates, 
metal  recovery  and solid –liquid  ratio (Seredkin  et al., 2016).  Costs  may be reduced  by 
oxidant regeneration by bio -oxidation and the use of saline water (such as sea water) 
(Paulson, 1992; Watling, 2015; Watling et al., 2014). Increased costs may discourage 
the use of some  of the most  efficient  leach  solutions,  such as chloride  solutions,  which 
corrode stainless steel and generate pitting corrosion in pipes (Zhou et al., 2018), 
especially with increased temperature. The selection of resistant materials, such as 
production  pipes,  artificial  lift systems,  casings,  tanks  and surface  facilities  that contact 
the fluid, may increase operational costs. Supplementary information for Fig. 2 -15 is 
presented in Appendix  C.

2.5. Conclusions  
 
 
Screening tests on cuboid samples with several oxidants under the same conditions 
indicated that the alternative systems tested do not offer an improved leaching rate 
compared with more traditional systems. The stabilities of the alternative solutions, 
such as K 2Cr2O7+HCl and H 2O2+glycine, indicated a major probability of 
decomposition or product formation related to an increased temperature, which 
affected the copper dissolution rate. Copper recovery was enhanced for chloride -
containing systems (FeCl 3+HCl and CuCl 2+HCl). A change in product layer texture 
(including reaction -related fractures around product phases) with improved flow and 
sample accessibility resulted with the use of cupric -chloride and ferric - chloride 
oxidants. Each system has an optimal op erating window, and the same conditions did 
not affect all systems equally. The selection of a suitable leaching system must be 
based on the specific characteristics of each deposit and operating requirements (depth, 
mineralogy, temperature, pressure, and surface facilities).  Table

Chapter 3. Kinetic study of chalcopyrite dissolution with iron(III) 
chloride in methanesulfonic acid  
 
The suitability of methanesulfonic acid as a copper lixiviant with ferric chloride as an 
oxidant was studied by analysing the leaching kinetics and by cha racterising solid 
residues  from  leach  tests on a chalcopyrite -rich ore sample.  The effects  of temperature, 
initial acidity, ferric -ion concentration and particle size were determined. The leach 
kinetics were dependent on the temperature and particle size, whereas the acid and 
ferric concentrations had a minimal impact on the leaching rate within the ranges 
studied. Although a sulfur layer formed on the solid residue, the reaction mechanism 
could be modelled with the shrinking -core model with surface chemica l-reaction 
control, which implies that lixiviant flow through the sulfur layer did not control the 
reaction rate. The apparent activation energy was 101 kJ mol–1 as calculated by the 
Arrhenius and 'time -to-a-given -fraction' methods. The activation paramete rs of the 
reaction were an enthalpy (ΔH++) of 99.4 kJ mol–1, and an entropy (ΔS++) of –197 J 
mol –1K–1 as calculated by using transition state theory and the Eyring  equation.  
 
3.1. Introduction  
 
Pure or alloyed copper is used extensively in society in agriculture, construction, 
electric appliances and equipment, transport, machinery and medicine (Barceloux, 
1999). The increasing demand for this metal and the imbalance between its  extraction 
and th e discoveries of copper deposits require the exploitation of refractory and low - 
grade ores that have previously been regarded as uneconomical (Northey et al., 2014; 
Tilton and Lagos, 2007). Hydrometallurgical methods have become a feasible 
approach for co pper production, with heap leaching being a common 
hydrometallurgical technique for low -grade metal extraction (Bartlett, 1997). In -situ 
recovery (ISR) has been suggested as a profitable alternative to recover copper from 
inaccessible,  deep  ore bodies  (Nor they et al., 2013).  Refractory  chalcopyrite  (CuFeS 2) 
is the most common copper -bearing mineral and represents more than half of global 
copper mineral reserves (Wang, 2005). Copper extraction from chalcopyrite requires 
the addition of an oxidant and lixivia nt. Several lixiviant –oxidant systems have been 
tested  to provide  rapid  copper  extraction  without  iron-hydroxy -product -precipitate  and 
91 4 Chapter 3  
 
 
passivation -layer formation (Córdoba et al., 2009). Ferric oxidant has proven to be a 
viable oxidant for chalcopyrite leaching, particularly in bioleaching systems, and has 
already been implemented in industrial copper -extraction processes, such as the 
BioCop, Sepon and Geocoat™ applications (Kowalczuk and Chmielewski, 2008).  
 
Equations (1) to (3) present the reactions between chalcopyrite and ferric chloride in 
an acid environment. Chalcopyrite oxidation results in sulfur -layer formation, which 
could result in a coating of the chalcopyrite surface. This sulfur may be oxidised b y 
excess  ferric  oxidant  to form  sulfate  at a significantly  slower  rate than the chalcopyrite 
dissolution.  Complete  sulfur  oxidation  within  a limited  experimental  time scale  occurs 
only if the temperature is sufficiently high and if sufficient oxidant is pr esent in the 
system.  
 
CuFeS 2 + 4FeCl 3  → CuCl 2 + 5FeCl 2 + 2S0 (1) 
S0 + 6FeCl 3 + 4H 2O → SO2− + 6Fe2+ + 8H+ + 18Cl− (2) 
CuFeS 2 + 16FeCl 3 + 8H 2O → CuCl 2 + 2H 2SO 4 + 17FeCl 2  + 12HCl  (3) 
 
In the absence of oxidant, chalcopyrite may react with acid to yield soluble copper as 
shown in Equation (4). This reaction is not spontaneous but has been observed 
experimentally (Lu et al., 2016).  
 
CuFeS 2 + 4H+ → Cu2+ + Fe2+ + 2H 2S (4) 
 
Previous studies with hydrochloric acid and ferric chloride have shown that the main 
reaction  product  is elemental  sulfur,  which  forms  rapidly  during  the leaching  reaction. 
Minimal further oxidation of S0 to sulfate results, despite extended leaching times  
(Dutrizac, 1990; Jones and Peters, 1976). Equation (1) is believed to be the dominant 
reaction, followed by a slow conversion of some of the elemental sulfur to sulfate, as 
was identified by Dutrizac (1990), where more than 95% of the sulfur in sulfide 
converted to elemental sulfur, and less than 5% sulfate formed. This result was found 
to be independent of oxidant and acid concentrations.  
 
 
 
 
 
92 Chapter 3  
 
 
Several kinetic studies have been conducted over a range of temperatures and pH 
conditions below 2.5 in the presence of hydrochloric and sulfuric acids to evaluate 
copper  extraction  (Table  3-1). Chalcopyrite  leaching  with ferric  chloride  is reported  to 
be controlled  by an electrochemical  reaction  at the surface  of the mineral.  This reaction 
requires  a high energy  input  because  strong  chemical  bonds  in the crystalline  structure 
of the chalcopyrite result in a significant energy consumption by the displacemen t of 
ions from  bulk of the particle  to the surface  (Córdoba  et al., 2008).  The formation  of a 
sulfur surface coating could result in a diffusion -controlled reaction. However, as 
shown in Table 3 -1, most researchers have reported a chemical -reaction -control 
mechanism rather than diffusion control. Therefore, this sulfur layer appears to allow 
for continued lixiviant access to the reaction interface, which may indicate that the 
coating has an elevated porosity (Havlík et al., 1995; Hirato et al., 1986; Rath et al., 
1988). Activation energies that have been calculated for chalcopyrite dissolution wit h 
ferric chloride vary from 15 kJ mol–1 to 93 kJ mol–1, and the reaction kinetics are 
dependent on the material type (natural or synthetic), particle size and gangue  content 
(Dutrizac,  1981).

There has been an increasing interest in hydrometallurgical applications, such as ISR 
and heap leaching, because of more stringent environmental controls for copper - 
ore/concentrate processing by conventional pyrometallurgical techniques, which are 
associa ted with hydrogen -sulfide and sulfur -dioxide production, and because of the 
prospect of an increased exploitation of otherwise non -profitable ores (Feng et al., 
2015a; U.S Congress, 1988). A major concern related to ISR and heap leaching is the 
risk of wat er and soil contamination from the lixiviant and pregnant leach solution 
(Seredkin et al., 2016), and, therefore, the selection of a lixiviant of low toxicity for 
subterranean use is desired.  
 
The use of lixiviants with a lower environmental impact is attractive in copper 
hydrometallurgical  applications,  such as heap  leaching  and in-situ recovery,  especially 
if these circumvent potential toxic gas production and surface and groundwater 
contamina tion. Hydrochloric or sulfuric acid lixiviants have been used in the ferric - 
ion system, because the presence of a strong acid accelerates chalcopyrite dissolution 
(Lu et al., 2000; Lundstrom et al., 2008; Wang, 2005). Despite the potential for use  of 
these acids in heap -leaching and ISR applications, an alternative environmentally 
friendly  lixiviant  that is less corrosive  than hydrochloric  acid would  be useful  for heap 
leaching and would facilitate the application of the ISR technology (Noor and Al - 
Moubaraki, 2008). The environmental advantages of methanesulfonic acid (MSA) 
include an elevated degradability, a low corrosivity and a lack of hazardous volatile 
produc ts generation, which make it ‘greener’ compared with hydrochloric, sulfuric, 
fluoroboric  and nitric  acids.  Its increasing  importance  as an electrolyte  system  (Gernon 
et al., 1999; Florence et al., 2011) has improved MSA’s commercial availability for 
bulk i ndustrial applications. The average cost of one metric ton of MSA (70% purity) 
is more  than 50% of the cost of sulfuric  acid (98%  purity)  and hydrochloric  acid (32% 
purity). MSA may be perceived to be an expensive reactant and, as such, has not  been 
used e xtensively in metal -extraction applications. Nonetheless its strong acidity, 
potential for recycling and its environmental advantages make it a viable alternative 
for applications such as heap leaching and  ISR. 
 
In the presence of MSA, ferric methanesulfonate may form by Equation (5) with 
subsequent proposed reactions as shown in Equations (6) to (8).

Organic  acids  are a possible  alternative  as less harmful  lixiviants,  but requirements  for 
a strong  acid have  limited  their applicability  (Feng  et al., 2015a).  Methanesulfonic  acid 
is an organic  acid that is formed  by the atmospheric  oxidation  of dimethyldisulfide.  Its 
high dissolving strength and acid strength compared with other organic acids make it 
suitable for the extraction of heavy metals such as lead and copper. MSA’s acid 
dissociation constant is –1.92, which is higher than that of nitric acid ( –1.3) and clo se 
to that of sulfuric acid ( –2). This strong organic acid is almost 99.8% ionised in a 0.1 
mol L-1 solution (BASF, 2012; Gernon et al., 1999; Feng et al., 2015a; Patai and 
Rappoport,  2006;  Wu et al., 2014).  MSA  is readily  biodegradable,  with sulfate,  wate r, 
biomass  and carbon  dioxide  being  generated  as a product  of biological  activity.  MSA’s 
lack of odour, its low toxicity and corrosiveness and the fact that it is unlikely to 
generate harmful gases during its use make it a “greener” alternative to the sulfuric - 
and hydrochloric -acid leaching of chalcopyrite and potentially attractive for  use in 
heap -leaching or ISR applications (Hasan and Rohan, 2010). Despite the 
environmental benefits of this acid having been analysed for other applications, such 
as electrowinning, catalysts and polymer solvents (Commarieu et al., 2002; Gernon  et 
al., 1 999; Florence et al., 2011; Hasan and Rohan, 2010), limited studies have been 
conducted  on the effectiveness  of MSA  as a lixiviant  in hydrometallurgical  processes, 
focused  principally  on carbonate  disolution  (Feng  et al., 2015a;  Feng  et al., 2015b;  Wu 
et al., 2014),  and its applicability  to the leaching  of refractory  copper  minerals  such as 
chalcopyrite  has not yet been  evaluated.  This study  aimed  at understanding  the reaction 
kinetics of the ferric chloride/MSA system in the dissolution of a natural chalcopyrite 
sample with gangue inclusions at low to moderate temperatures (< 90°C) to elucidate 
its possible application in hydrometallurgical  processing.

3.2. Experimental  
 
3.2.1.  Materials  
 
A chalcopyrite -bearing sample was ball milled and dry sieved. Sized samples were 
blended with a ball mill and riffle split into representative fractions. Because of the 
economic advantage of ferric ion as oxidant, the possible biological regeneration of 
such an oxidant and its compatibility with MSA (Wu et al., 2014), screening 
experiments  with MSA  (0.5 mol L-1) and stoichiometric  amounts  of ferric  chloride  and 
ferric sulfate as iron -based oxidants were conducted at 60°C. Copper extractions of 
50% were achieved with ferric chloride after 24 h, and the copper extraction with 
sulfate solution was 20%. Based on these screening tests, ferric chloride was selected  
as the preferred oxidant in this  study.  
 
Stock  solutions  (3 mol L-1 and 0.5 mol L-1 free acid,  pH –2.44,  707 mV) were  prepared 
in deionised water from analytical -grade anhydrous ferric chloride (98%, Chem 
Supply, Australia) and MSA (100% as Solutrix E, DP -HS-1004,  BASF, Germany ). 
The sample mineralogy was determined using a PANalytical Empyrean X -ray 
diffractometer equipped with a Bragg -Brentano  HD incident  monochromator.  The 
incident  beam  working  parameters were  a 0.5ᵒ divergence  slit at 40 kV, 40 mA and 0.02 
rad soller  slits and a 1ᵒ antiscatter slit. A pixel three dimensions (3D) array detector in 
scanning one dimension  (1D) mode with 0.125° ant iscatter slit and 0.02 rad soller slits 
were used for the diffracted beam. The scan was performed using theta/theta geometry, 
with a 3 –120ᵒ scan range, and a 2 -h scanning time. Sample mineral identification was 
performed using High Score Plus  3.0d.  
 
3.2.2.  Method s 
 
Experiments were conducted in a closed tumbling water bath (15 inversions min–1) 
using 15 -mL Nalgene bottles that contained 1 g chalcopyrite -containing sample and 
10 mL of lixiviant solution. The baseline experimental conditions are described in 
Table 3 -2. Series of experiments were conducted in which one of the four different 
parameters investigated (particle size, ferric concentration, MSA concentration and 
temperature)  was varied  while  the other  baseline  conditions  were  maintained  constant.  
 
97 Chapter 3  
 
 
MSA concentrations were varied at 0.05, 0.1, 0.5 and 0.75 mol L-1. A 200% excess  of 
ferric  ions was used at concentrations  of 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3 mol L-1. Particle  sizes  of 
–106+75 µm, –75+53 µm, –53+45 µm, –45+38 µm and –38 µm and  temperatures of 
40°C, 50°C, 60°C, 70°C and 90°C were studied.

The bottle headspace was flushed with high -purity nitrogen gas to minimise the 
amount of oxygen in the system. Each kinetic data point was determined from an 
individual experiment. The final solution pH and Eh were measured using a TPS  WP- 
80 pH/ORP  meter  with double -junction  Ag/AgCl/saturated  KCl probe.  After  reaction, 
solutions were filtered and diluted 300 -fold before copper and iron concentrations were 
determined using an Agilent 240/280 atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS)  (4–
5 mA, 222.6 –217.9  nm for copper  and 386–392 nm for iron).  Solid  residues were 
filtered, rinsed and dried using a vacuum filter and a standard oven at 30ᵒC, and 
weighed. Solid samples were analysed by quantitative X -ray diffractometry (QXRD), 
using the same conditions that were  used for the initial chalcopyrite sample. Coarse - 
grained solid residues ( –106+75 µm) were mounted on a stub and epoxy mounts and 
studied by scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy -dispersive 
spectroscopy (SEM –EDS) using a JEOL -JSM-7001 field em ission scanning electron 
microscope, Bruker Esprit 1.9 EDS system, Bruker 10 mm SDD EDS detector with 
125 eV resolution, 20 kV accelerating voltage and a 10 -mm working distance in 
backscattered electron imaging  mode.

spectroscopy (ICP –AES) (see Table 3 -3). The QXRD analysis correlated with the 
chemical analysis revealed that the initial sample consisted of 67.2% chalcopyrite 
(CuFeS 2), 24.4% quartz (SiO 2) and 8.4% sphalerite (ZnS) (Fig. 3 -1).

3.3.1.  Effect of initial acid concentration  
 
The copper extraction as a function of initial MSA concentration did not vary 
significantly for the MSA concentrations tested (Fig. 3 -2a). The order of the 
relationship between the MSA concentration and the chalcopyrite dissolution was 
0.18,  which  implies  that the dissolution  is independent  of the initial  acid concentration. 
Ferric and ferrous ions (Fe+3 and Fe+2) are highly soluble in MSA (saturation 
concentrations  are 502 g/L and 690 g/L at 23ᵒC,  respectively)  because  of the formation 
of soluble m ethanesulfonates, even under neutral pH conditions (BASF, 2012). 
Therefore, the principal role of the MSA may be to prevent iron hydrolysis by the 
formation of highly soluble ferrous methanesulfonate Fe(CH 3SO 3)2. If MSA were 
considered to be active in the formation of copper complexes, a stoichiometric MSA 
concentration of 0.26 mol L-1  would be required for dissolution. In this study, a  lower  
99 
Chapter 3  
 
 
concentration of MSA than that stoichiometrically required resulted in similar copper 
extractions, and dissolution is therefore not expected to proceed by the complexation 
mechanism but rather by Equations (1) –(3) and (5) –(8). However, a minimum MSA 
concen tration of 0.05 mol L-1 was required to avoid iron precipitation upon solution 
cooling to room temperature. The largest difference in leaching occurred for the 
experiments  with 0.1 and 0.5 mol L–1 MSA  and 4 h, with a difference  of 17.5%  copper 
extraction. All experiments that were conducted for 24 h achieved 100% copper 
extraction, with the final solution pH being below –0.5. This represents an advantage 
in terms of acid usage because a similar leaching extent can be achieved at a low acid 
concentration.  A similar  minor  effect  of acid concentration  has also been  observed  for 
lead mineral  dissolution,  in which  strong  oxidative  mineral  attack  occurred  at low acid 
concentrations (Wu et al., 2014). We conducted an experiment with 0.5 mol L–1 MSA 
under anaerobic conditions. The result from this text is shown in Fig. 3 -2b, in which 
the copper  dissolution  was less than 4% during  the first 48 h and remained  below  30% 
after more than 10 days of leaching at 90ᵒC. Hydrogen sulfide was generated, which 
indicates that the reaction proceeded according to Equation (4) and emphasizes the 
requirement for an oxidant to dissolve the  mineral.  
 
3.3.2.  Effect of initial iron(III) concent ration  
 
The influence of ferric -ion concentration is shown in Fig. 3 -2b. The leaching rate 
increased slightly with an increase in ferric -chloride concentration, but because high 
initial  concentrations  were  used,  this change  was small.  Hirato  et al. (1986)  found  that, 
in a hydrochloric -acid system, total copper extractions were more sensitive to ferric - 
ion concentrations below 1 mol L–1. Complete copper extraction was achieved for all 
tested concentrations. The relationship between the leaching rate constants and the 
ferric -chloride concentration is linear with a slope of 0.43, which indicates that the 
reaction  is almost  half order  with respect  to the initial  iron concentration,  and which  is 
consistent with previously reported slopes of 0.3 to 0.5 and  0.8. It is likely that the 
different slopes resuleted from variations in solid reactant composition (Ammou - 
Chokroum et al., 1979; Dutrizac, 1981; Hirato et al., 1986; Majima et al., 1985; Rath 
et al.,  1988).

3.3.3.  Effect of particle  size 
 
In our experiments, copper extraction was highly dependent on grain size (see Fig. 3 - 
2c). Small  increases  in the size fraction  increased  the reaction  time to achieve  complete 
copper recovery by  several hours. For example, the coarsest particle size required 120 
h to achieve total dissolution compared with 8 h that for the finest particle size. The 
reaction rate of ferric ions and MSA with chalcopyrite was slower than with galena 
(Wu et al., 2014)  but comparable with studies using ferric ion as an oxidant in 
hydrochloric or sulfuric acids under conditions similar to this study (Munoz et al., 
1979; Rath et al.,  1988).  
 
3.3.4.  Effect of  temperature  
 
The effect of temperature is shown in Fig. 3 -2d. Copper ex traction increased with an 
increase in temperature because Eq. (1) is endothermic, and energy addition is an 
important requirement for dissolution. Although a maximum dissolution was not 
achieved after 168 h at 40ᵒC, Fig. 3 -2d suggests that the sample cont inued to react 
beyond 168 h. Under established standard conditions, a 120 -h time difference to 
maximum  dissolution  existed  between  90ᵒC  and 70ᵒC,  a slight  increase  in temperature 
has a strong effect on the reaction kinetics. This behaviour may be an indica tor of the 
reaction mechanism because chemical -reaction -controlled processes exhibit large 
differences for small changes in temperature (Dreisinger and Abed,  2002).

3.3.5.  Kinetic analysis by shrinking -core models  
 
Because chalcopyrite dissolution under acidic conditi ons is a heterogeneous reaction 
and depends on the reactant concentration and its change during the reaction, a rate 
equation can be established to provide the relationship between the experimental data 
and time. Such functions are usually empirical and ar e used to determine the reaction 
mechanism and rate constant (Putnis 1992). The model as given by Eq. (9) provides 
an integrated rate equation, where kc is the rate constant, t is the reaction time, x is the 
fraction transformed and g(x) is a function that  describes the variation of x with time.  
 
𝑔(𝑥) = 𝑘𝑐𝑡 (9) 
 
A shrinking -core model was selected, in which the reaction front commences at the 
outer particle surface and moves into the remaining bulk solid. The reaction rate  will 
 
102 
 
  
Chapter 3  
 
 
be controlled by the diffusion of reactant to the reaction interface through the 
surrounding solution, infiltration and diffusion of the reactant within pores to the 
mineral surface, surface chemical reaction with the solid and element transpo rt from 
the reaction interface into the bulk solution (Levenspiel, 1999).  
 
Empirical  rate equations  for heterogeneous  reactions  have  been  developed  to constrain 
the reaction control steps and we analysed our experimental data using six equations 
(Table 3 -4). The data that were fitted to the film -diffusion -control model showed the 
poorest correlation and were discarded. The highest determination coefficients were 
obtained for the chemical -reaction control equation (with temperature data shown in 
Fig. 3-3), which confirms  the mechanism  as suggested  by the effect  of temperature  on 
the reaction  rate and agrees  with other  published  kinetic  analyses  using  ferric  ion as an 
oxidant (Al -Harahsheh and Kingman, 2007; Córdoba et al., 2008; Dutrizac, 1981; 
Majima  et al., 1985;  Palmer  et al., 1981;  Rath  et al., 1988).  Elemental  sulfur  in chloride 
systems is reported to form a porous layer that allows for continued contact with 
reactants (Hirato et al., 1986; Palmer et al., 1981; Rath et al., 1988), which likely allows 
for continued lixiviant access to the reaction interface and element  transport.

In chemical -reaction  control,  the rate is proportional  to the unreacted  core surface  area. 
The reactant concentration in the bulk solution may be considered to be fixed  because 
of the excess that was used. Equation (6) describes the integrated rate equation for 
chemical -reaction -controlled processes for spherical particles (Levenspiel, 199 9), 
where x is the fraction of reacted solid, τ is the time required to reach complete 
conversion of the core ( r = 0) and kc is the kinetic rate constant given by the inverse of 
τ (Eq. (10)).

The activation  energy  (Ea) was determined  by Arrhenius’s  law (Eqs (11))  (Levenspiel, 
1999). The rate constants ( kc) for each temperature were obtained from the slopes of 
the lines in Fig. 3 -4. A plot of ln k c versus 1/T (Eq. (12)) allows for the value of the 
apparent activation energy and the frequency factor ( A) to be calculated (Fig.  3-4a).

Other activation parameters were estimated by using the transition -state theory. The 
relationship between the temperature and the reaction rate constant is given by the 
Eyring  equation  (Eq. (13))  (Kuhn,  2000).  The differential  form  of this equation  relates  
the activation enthalpy term to the activation energy (Eq.  (14)).

Linearisation to give Eq. (15) allows for a determination of the activation parameters 
(enthalpy  and entropy)  from  a plot of T x ln (kc/T) versus  T for the calculation  of ∆H++ 
from the intercept and ΔS++ from the slope (Lente et al., 2005) (Fig. 3 -4b). The

The apparent  activation  energy  as calculated  using  the shrinking -core model  was 101.3 
kJ mol–1. This value is consistent with the selected empirical equations that were  used 
to describe  the reaction  mechanism,  even  though  it exceeds  55 to 88 kJ mol–1 as found 
previously for the ferric oxidant (Table 3 -1). However, it is closer to the 131 kJ mol–1 
and 93 kJ mol–1 values that were determined for ferric -ion leaching by Córdoba et al. 
(2008) and Rath et al. (1988), respectively. Dutrizac (1981) described the gangue 
content or non -copper -containing minerals in the sample as a ‘complication factor’ that 
may influence the activation energy if the gangue minerals are reactive. Because our  
sample  contained  33% non-copper -containing  minerals,  a higher  activation  energy 
compared with the fairly pure chalcopyrite concentrate that was analysed in previous 
studies  appears to be reasonable. The use of impure chalcopyrite for kinetics analysis 
provides  a more  realistic  representation  of a potential  practical  application.  The current 
high value could also be explained by the crystal structure of chalcopyrite and its 
semiconductor  nature,  where  ion transport  to energy  vacancies  and electrons  (Fe+2 and 
Cu+) through the crystal lattice to the surface requires a high energy consump tion 
(Córdoba et al., 2008; Hiskey, 1993; Parker et al., 1981). The frequency of the 
collisions as a determinant factor of the reaction speed was found to be 4.12  1013 h₋1 
by using the Arrhenius law, which indicates a slow reaction, as evidenced in pract ice. 
The activation enthalpy and entropy values as calculated from the transition -state- 
theory Eyring plot were 99.4 kJ mol–1 and -197 J mol –1K–1, respectively. The small 
difference  between  this value  and the activation  energy  of 101.4  kJ mol–1 is reason able 
for a near -ambient temperature, where Ea ≅ ∆ 𝐻++ (see Eq. (14)). The entropy is in the 
same range as that obtained by Dreisinger and Abed (2002) for reductive  leaching of  
chalcopyrite  in sulfate  and chloride  media  (–212.4  J mol –1K–1 and –242 J mol –1K₋1, 
respectively).  The negative  value  of the entropy  and positive  free energy  and enthalpy 
is indicative of a non -spontaneous reaction at any temperature and the formation of a 
transition -state complex.  
 
The activation -energy estimation as based on empirical mechanism equations has the 
disadvantage of being dependent on the subjective selection of a rate function. The 
determined rate constant has a significant impact on the activation energy. This 
limitation  and the inability to  identify changes  in mechanism  and  hence  activation

energy values during the reaction suggest the necessity for an alternative verification 
methodology (Putnis, 1992). An independent method, which is termed the ‘time to a 
given  fraction’  is based  on the relationship  between  the reacted  fraction  x and the time 
t (Eq. (17)), where time is a dependent variable, as shown in Eq.  (18).

𝑑𝑡 𝑐 
𝑑𝑡 = 𝑘𝑐−1. 𝑓−1(𝑥) 𝑑𝑥 (18) 
 
Integration between the initial and final fractions yields Eqs (19) to (21), where Ea 
represents  the apparent  activation  energy  in the specific  time required  to reach  a certain 
reaction  progress.

Similar to an Arrhenius plot, the plot of ln tx versus 1/T produces a line with slope 
Ea/R,  from  which  it is possible  to calculate  the activation  energy  for a specific  reacted 
fraction x. The calculation of Ea for different fractions enables the monitoring of 
possible changes in the reaction mechanism (Putnis, 1992; Qian et al., 2017). Two 
fractions  were  analysed.  The points  at 20% and 50% represent  the initial  and midpoint 
in the reaction, respectively, where no points of inflexion were found (Fig. 3 -5). The 
calculated Ea values were 101.2 kJ mol–1 and 94.9 kJ mol–1, respectively, which 
confirmed the choice of chemical reaction as the rate -controlling step. Tabl e 3-5 
summarizes the calculated rate constants for both methods. The experimental points 
fit all linear regressions plots, and the determination coefficients exceed  0.98.

3.3.6.  Residue  characterisation  
 
Residue samples from the –106+75 µm chalcopyrite fraction were studied by 
qualitative XRD and SEM. Samples were taken after 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h and 8 h 
of leaching, as shown in Fig. 3 -6. The main chalcopyrite peak at 34.24° existed in all 
patterns,  but the peak  intensity  decreased  by ~74%  between  the initial  and final curves. 
The main sulfur peak at 26.87° increased in the first 8 h in proportion to the decrease 
in chalcopyrite.

The identification of sulfur as a reaction product was corroborated by SEM. Figures 3 -
7a to 3 -7b show images of unpolished chalcopyrite grains after 8 h of leaching. Entire 
grains were covered by irregular interconnected globular grains of sulfur. The laye r 
morphology had an intergranular porosity that allows for continuous flow between the 
bulk reactant and the chalcopyrite. As the leaching progressed, open spaces in the 
chalcopyrite decreased as is evident in the micrographs. However, fluid diffusion 
through the product layer was not the rate -controlling step in the reaction, because the 
product layer was sufficiently porous and did not provide a barrier to continuous 
leaching, as was observed by Majima et al. (1985). No other phases, such as secondary 
copper sulfides or oxides, were found in cross sections of the samples. Such an 
observation may correspond to the stoichiometric dissolution of iron and copper or to 
the rapid formation and dissolution of intermediate phases, which may only be 
identified in i n-situ experiments.  
 
Cracks in the chalcopyrite particles were visible in cross -sectional SEM  micrographs; 
these may be reaction -enhanced fractures that form from volume reduction after 
copper  and iron leaching  and may allow  for sulfur  retention  or promote  reagent  access 
via generated rather than natural  fractures.

3.4. Concluding  remarks  
 
The leaching kinetics for an impure chalcopyrite sample with ferric -chloride solution 
in MSA was studied as a function of four parameters. The MSA concentration had a 
minor influence on the leaching rate and copper extraction was possible even at the 
lowes t acid concentration. Because excess oxidant was provided, no ferric -ion 
regeneration  was required,  and the principal  role of the acid was to prevent  hydrolysis. 
Additional experiments are required to determine the lowest acid concentration prior 
to which iron hydrolysis becomes problematic. The ferric -ion concentration did not 
have  a major  influence  on the kinetics  within  the range  tested  (1.5–3 mol L–1) and there 
is an approximately  half-order  dependence  on the ferric -ion concentration.  The particle 
size and temperature had a significant influence on the kinetics, with large changes in 
reaction rate occurring for small variations in time. Temperature d ata analysis 
indicated that the reaction kinetics are controlled by chemical reaction. This finding 
was supported  by a calculation  of the apparent  activation  energy  by different  methods. 
The average apparent activation energy was 101.3 kJ mol–1 as determined by the 
Arrhenius  equation,  and  94.95  kJ  mol–1  and  101.21  kJ  mol–1  for 20%  and  50%

dissolutions, respectively, by the ‘time -to-a-given -fraction’ method. Globular 
elemental sulfur encapsulated entire  chalcopyrite particles with intergranular porosity 
that allowed  for lixiviant  access  to the reaction  interface.  MSA  addition  did not appear 
to influence the texture of the reacted chalcopyrite. For hydrometallurgical 
applications, such as in a heap -leachi ng or an ISR application, the use of a 
biodegradable and recyclable acid, together with ferric ions and chloride -containing 
brine would constitute a reliable option for chalcopyrite extraction. Because of its 
environmental advantages, such as its low corro siveness and biodegradability, MSA 
could represent a viable option for ISR operations.

Chapter 4. Kinetics and mineralogical analysis of copper dissolution 
from a bornite/chalcopyrite composite sample in ferric -chloride and 
methanesulfonic -acid solutions  
 
Ore samples contain a variety of copper -bearing and gangue minerals that affect the 
leach kinetics. The kinetic behaviour of a natural ore sample (that contained 48.7% 
bornite and 15.8% chalcopyrite) in a solution of methanesulfonic acid and ferric 
chlorid e was studied. The dependence of the reaction kinetics on the acid and oxidant 
concentrations,  temperature  and particle  size was investigated.  The reaction  activation 
energy was calculated using two methods, by empirical kinetic equations and by the 
‘time -to-a-given -fraction’ method. The shrinking -core-model was fitted according to 
diffusion through a product layer, and an average apparent activation energy of 79.3 
kJ mol–1 was obtained.  Three  apparent  activation  energies  were  obtained  by the ‘time - 
to-a-given-fraction’ method; that for a copper extraction below 20% was 15.6 kJ mol–
1 for copper  intermediate  formation,  that between  20% and 50% copper  extraction was  
42.3 kJ mol–1 associated  with sulfur  formation  and that for dissolution  above  50% was  
76.5 kJ mol–1 for the final stage  when  the sulfur  layer  is covering  the entire  particle 
surface. The presence of chalcopyrite in the sample increased the average activation 
energy  by 69% compared  with a pure bornite  sample.  The leach  products  had different 
textures; the sulfur formed from chalcopyrite showed a more porous texture tha n that 
formed from bornite. These differences in texture are expected to affect the lixiviant 
access.  
 
4.1. Introduction  
 
Copper is a versatile material with specific properties, including a high conductivity 
and malleability  (Barceloux,  1999).  The continuous  demand  for copper  in conjunction 
with the depletion in accessible reserves require alternative processing routines for 
low-grade and abandoned ores (Ata et al., 2001). However, hydrometallurgical 
processing of certain copper -bearing minerals, such as refractory sulfides, remai ns 
challenging. Oxide leaching is conducted by acid dissolution (Kelm and Helle, 2005; 
Khalezov  et al., 1979;  Nicol,  2018),  but because  of the high acid consumption,  alkaline 
systems  are also being  considered  as a viable  leaching  alternative  (Aracena  et al., 2018;  
 
119 Chapter 4  
 
 
Ekmekyapar et al., 2015; Tanda et al., 2017). The processing of refractory copper 
sulfides is important, because these minerals comprise a large proportion of global 
copper. Chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) is the world’s most abundant copper mineral, and, 
together  with chalcocite  (Cu 2S) and bornite  (Cu 5FeS 4), may represent  the main  source 
of copper  when  easily  processed  copper  ores have  been  depleted.  Bornite  is frequently 
found in mixed deposits, together with other refractory copper minerals, such as 
chalcopyrite a nd chalcocite (Dutrizac et al., 1970; Wang et al., 2016). Kinetic studies 
are often conducted on pure mineral samples to provide a fundamental understanding 
of dissolution behaviour. However, in practice, natural samples contain a distribution 
of mineral t ypes, which may host the same element of interest. An understanding of 
composite -sample leaching kinetics provides useful information for application to 
hydrometallurgical operations where the selection of pure minerals is not an option, 
such as in in -situ recovery (ISR)  processing.  
 
A sample that contained copper minerals in the form of bornite and chalcopyrite was 
used in this study. Although reviews exist on chalcopyrite leaching (Li et al., 2013), 
no extensive recent review has been provided on bornite leaching. For this reason, 
relevant studies in this field are presented chronologically below.  
 
Studies on bornite kinetics date back to the 1930s, when Sullivan (1931) studied pure 
natural bornite dissolution in ferric -sulfate solution. He found that a ra pid first -stage 
mineral dissolution occurred before sulfur formation, with a leaching rate that was 
strongly dependent only on temperature changes. The mechanism that determines the 
rate equation, the activation energy and the mineralogical transformations  has been 
under discussion ever since. Lowe (1970) found that the rate is affected by time and 
that the activation energies differed depending on the residue depth in relation to the 
sample surface. Dutrizac and MacDonald (1973) confirmed that the role of the acid is 
to “assist” with ferric solubility, and it does not participate actively in the reaction.  
 
Ugarte -Alverez (1971) described a variation in leaching behaviour above and below 
40°C, and suggested idaite (Cu 3FeS 4) as the principal product of bornit e leaching. He 
also found  that at high temperature,  two stages  resulted;  the first showed  a rapid  copper 
extraction  of 40% without  sulfur  formation  and no iron leaching,  followed  by a slower 
dissolution stage where an intermediate solid phase was covered by elemental sulfur 
product.   Price   and   Chilton   (1981)   identified   two   products   only   during  the 
120 Chapter 4  
 
 
electroleaching of pure bornite when using sulfuric -acid solutions; Cu 2.5FeS 4 formed 
when current was applied and Cu 2S formed under controlled experiments without 
current. Pesic and Olson (1983) found similar results for chloride solutions compared 
with th ose for sulfate systems, but with a faster first -stage dissolution. The reaction 
was divided into two main stages with an interim transition period. Dutrizac et al. 
(1985) defined products that formed at different times and temperatures as non - 
stoichiomet ric bornite, digenite, chalcopyrite and an intermediate isotropic copper 
sulfide with a chalcopyrite -like structure and a variable composition from Cu 4.1FeS 4 to 
Cu3FeS 4. These minerals yielded soluble copper and sulfur as the final products.  
 
Table 4 -1 presents a summary of the bornite kinetic -leaching studies in which 
activation energies and reaction mechanisms were reported. Additional recent studies 
on bornite  leachin g behaviour,  such as by Lundström  et al. (2016),  Veloso  et al. (2016), 
Yang  et al. (2018)  and Zhao  et al. (2015)  have  not been  included  in Table  4-1, as these 
studies did not report activation energies.  
 
Wall et al. (2011) investigated bornite dissolution by real -time in-situ x-ray powder 
diffraction  (XRD),  which  showed  a significant  unit-cell variation  during  its dissolution 
in ferric -sulfate  solution.  The results  included  a real-time analysis  of product  formation 
and indicated a significant variation of the unit cell during the first 7% copper 
dissolution. The leaching of impure samples with different contents of bornite and 
gangue  minerals  has not been  studied  extensively,  but most  recent  studies  note the co- 
presence of chalcopyrite as a sample phase. Other studies have been performed to 
understand the interaction of chalcopyrite and bornite on the enhanced rate of bornite 
leaching  by using  mixed  or separate  samples  (Dutrizac  et al., 1971;  Lu and Dreisinger, 
2013;  Wang  et al., 2016)  but the influence  of the presence  of other  copper  minerals  on 
the kinetic mechanism and activation -energy requirements has not been  determined.

As mentioned previously, in this study, a sample that contained mainly bornite, 
chalcopyrite  and sphalerite  was used.  The sample  was leached  in methanesulfonic  acid 
(MSA) with ferric chloride as the oxidant. The relevant dissolution reactions for 
bornite, chalcopyrite and sphalerite and information on MSA are presented  below.  
As described above, bornite dissolution occurs in stages (Pesic and Olson (1983) 
(Equati ons (1) to (4), shown for a chloride system). The first stage involves the removal 
of cuprous ions from the bornite by ferric -ion oxidation to produce an intermediate  
Cu3FeS 4 copper -deficient  phase  (Manning,  1967;  Pesic  and Olson,  1983). The second  
stage  consists  of complete  dissolution  with the production  of elemental  
 
122 4 Chapter 4  
 
 
sulfur.  Sulfur  oxidation  with residual  oxidant  may yield  sulfate,  however,  only a small 
(from 1.5 to 5.2%) amount of sulfate has been reported from bioleaching  experiments 
(Wang et al.,  2018).  
Stage I  
Cu5FeS 4  + 4FeCl 3  →  Cu 3FeS 4   + 2CuCl 2 + 4FeCl 2 (1) 
Stage II  
Cu3FeS 4   + 8FeCl 3  → 9FeCl 2  + 3CuCl 2 + 4S0 (2) 
S0 + 6FeCl 3  + 4H 2O → SO2− + 6Fe2+ + 8H+ + 18Cl− (3) 
Cu3Fe𝑆4   + 32FeCl 3  + 16H 2O → 3CuCl 2  + 4H 2SO4  + 33FeCl 2 + 24HCl  (4) 
 
In the absence of an oxidant, but above a solution potential of 250 mV versus the 
standard hydrogen electrode, bornite dissolves in acid to yield secondary -copper - 
enriched layers (Equations (5) to (6) (Zhao et al., 2015)). These equations can be 
considere d as intermediate  electrochemical  reactions  in the dissolution  of bornite  with 
an oxidant.  Equation  (5) shows  the intermediate  copper -deficient  layers  that have  been 
identified in previous  studies.  
 
Cu5FeS 4  → Cu 5−xFeS 4  + xCu2+ + 2𝑥𝑒− (5) 
Cu5−xFeS 4  + 6H+ → 𝐶𝑢S + (4 − x )Cu2+ + 3𝐻2𝑆 + Fe3+ + (5 − 2𝑥)𝑒− (6) 
 
The composite  sample  that was used in this study  contained  chalcopyrite,  which  reacts 
with ferric chloride according to Equation (7). The reaction kinetics and products that 
were obtained from chalcopyrite dissolution with ferric chloride under the same 
conditions as used in this study are provided in a previous publication (Hidalgo et al., 
2018).  
 
CuFeS 2  + 16FeCl 3  + 8H 2O → CuCl 2  + 2H 2SO4  + 17FeCl 2 + 12HCl  (7) 
 
Although  copper  is the focus  in this study,  other  metal  sulfides,  such as sphalerite,  are 
often present in copper -sulfide samples, and these may dissolve in a ferric chloride 
system. The dissolution kinetics of sphalerite have been studied previously (Aydogan 
et al., 2005; Dutrizac and Macdonald, 1978), and sphalerite reacts according  to: 
 
ZnS + 2FeCl 3  → ZnCl 2  + 2FeCl 2 + 𝑆0 (8)

MSA or methanesulfonic acid (CH 3SO 3H) is a relatively new, biodegradable  organic - 
acid lixiviant that is used as an electrolyte for heavy metals and is formed from the 
oxidation of dimethylsulfide (Bork et al., 2014; Gernon et al., 1999). This acid has 
mostly replaced hydrofluoric acid as a complexing agent for industrial lead and tin 
electroplating, and has proven effective in copper baths (Florence et al.,  2011).  
 
• The benefits of MSA for industrial application include its usefulness as an 
electrolyte for heavy -metal salt dissolution and its conductivity, high stability 
and low toxicity  (Gernon et al., 1999), which are positive characteristics for 
hydrometallurgical applications, especially for ISR processing, with 
environmental concerns related to  groundwater.  
 
• The ability  of MSA  to solubilise  otherwise  often  normally  insoluble  metals  has 
attracted recent research in hydrometallurgical applications as described in 
Table 4 -2. The results obtained in previous research are encouraging (Wu et 
al., 2014a; Wu et al., 2014b), in that the effectiveness of MSA in terms of 
enhancing solubi lity is comparable with that of stronger acids, and its high 
heavy -metal solubility provides an opportunity for the treatment of copper – 
lead–zinc–containing ores in an ISR  environment.  
 
• MSA may also provide advantages in terms of iron product formation. S ulfate 
for jarosite formation (by reaction with ferric ions and monovalent cations) 
may originate from the oxidation of sulfide minerals. Sulfuric acid may also 
serve as a sulfate source for jarosite formation. However, because MSA is 
stable, forming metha nesulfonate ions upon dissociation, less jarosite is 
expected to form, especially if the extent of oxidation of sulfide minerals to 
form sulfate ions is  small.  
 
• MSA  shows  promise  in downstream  processing  after the extraction  of valuable 
metal  from  concentr ates. The oxidant/MSA  fluid  may be regenerated  by anodic 
reaction in electrowinning, as proven at the bench scale for lead processing, 
which  involves  a fluid  passing  through  a cell with graphite  anodes  and stainless  
 
124 Chapter 4  
 
 
steel cathodes (Wu et al., 2014b). Lead is recovered at the cathode, whereas the 
ferrous iron is oxidised by electrolysis to regenerate ferric iron for  recycle. In  a 
copper  system,  it is anticipated  that a similar  approach  could  be used,  with 
copper recovery at the cathode and ferric iron at the  anode.  
 
Because of the possible environmental and other advantages of this acid over other 
known acids, and with a view towards its application in an ISR environment, MSA 
was selected as the most s uitable lixiviant in this work.

The rationale of this study was to determine the kinetic behaviour of a natural

125 Chapter 4  
 
 
analyse the resulting surface layers, and compare this analy sis with previous work on 
pure chalcopyrite  leaching  under  the same  conditions  (Hidalgo  et al., 2018).  This work 
aimed to identify the individual effects of the bornite and chalcopyrite in the sample 
on the kinetic parameters. In recent years, besides the standard empirical kinetics 
model approaches, kinetics in mineral transformations and replacements in aqueou s 
solutions have been studied by using other models, such as the ‘time -to-a-given - 
fraction’ method (Di Lorenzo et al., 2014; Okada and Utsumi, 2003; Pedrosa et al., 
2017; Perdikouri et al., 2011; Qian et al., 2017). This method has been applied to 
chalcop yrite kinetics because of the complexity of the refractory -mineral dissolution, 
and complements the shrinking -core model (Kuzmina et al., 2017). We have used 
conventional  empirical  models  and the time-to-a-given -fraction  model  to calculate  the 
reaction act ivation energies for the bornite/chalcopyrite sample  dissolution.  
 
4.2. Experimental  
 
4.2.1.  Materials and  methods  
 
A natural sulfide sample was used as the starting material for the experiments. The 
mineral -phase distributions were determined by quantitative X -ray diffraction 
(QXRD) using a PANalytical Empyrean X -ray diffractometer equipped with a Bragg - 
Brentano HD in cident monochromator. The incident -beam working parameters were 
a 0.5ᵒ divergence  slit at 40 kV, 40 mA and 0.02 rad soller  slits and a 1° antiscatter  slit. 
The QXRD analysis showed that the sample contained 48.8% bornite, 15.8% 
chalcopyrite,  16.1%  sphalerite  and several  gangue  minerals  (see Fig. 4-1). The sample 
was prepared  by ball milling,  sieving  and separation  into five size fractions.  The bulk- 
sample elemental distribution, as determined by inductively coupled plasma –atomic 
emission spectroscopy (ICP –OES), is presented in Table 4 -3. The percent copper 
varied  from  32.4%  for the –38 µm particles  to 36.6%  for the –106+75  µm size fraction.  
 
Iron was selected as a suitable oxidant based on economic considerations (compared 
with other more expensive oxidants that may be suitable for ISR). Screening 
experiments  with ferric  chloride  and ferric  sulfate  were  conducted  to identify  the most 
efficient  oxidant for leaching. In preliminary tests, at 60°C, after 5 days of leaching, 
the maximum  copper  extraction  with ferric -sulfate  solutions  was 33%,  whereas  that 
126 Chapter 4  
 
 
with the ferric -chloride solution reached 70%. Based on these results, ferric chloride 
was selected as the oxidant in this work.

Different concentrations of ferric ions and acid were used to prepare stock solutions 
with analytical -grade anhydrous ferric chloride (98%, Chem Supply, Australia) and 
MSA  (100%,  BASF,  Germany)  in deionised  water.  Oxidant  concentrations  were  based 
on calculations of total required copper oxidation (Equations 1 to 4), and an excess of 
200%  oxidant  was used in the leach  tests.  A pulp density  of 10% m/m solids  was used 
and 1 g of sample was placed in 15 mL Nalgene bottles with 10 mL of solution. The 
bottle headspace was flushed with high -purity nitrogen gas and sealed. The bottles 
were placed in a tumbling water bath at a constant speed of 15 rpm. The baseline 
experimental conditions included a sample particle size of –38 µm, a 3 mol L–1 ferric 
concentration and acid concentration of 0.5 mol L–1 at 90°C. One of the four different 
parameters investigated (particle size, ferric concentration, MSA concentration and 
temperature) was varied to identify its effect on the reaction kinetics, while the othe r 
baseline conditions were kept constant (Table 4 -4). Temperatures from 40°C to  90°C  
 
 
127 
Chapter 4  
 
 
were studied in 10°C increments and ferric -ion concentrations were varied between 0 
and 3 mol L–1. The particle size was varied from an upper size range of –106+75 µm 
to a lower range –38 µm and the acid concentration was varied from 0.75 mol L–1 to 
0.05 m ol L–1. Replicate tests were conducted and a difference of less than 3% in 
repeatability was obtained.

Each experiment served as a unique data point in the reaction kinetics analysis. The 
final solids residue was filtered, the pH and Eh were measured and the copper 
concentration was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (Agilent 
240/280). Quanti tative Evaluation of Minerals by Scanning Electron Microscopy 
(QEMSCAN) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were used for the 
phase analysis. Solid samples were rinsed three times with deionised water, dried at 
30ᵒC and weighed. Reacted residues from tests at 90°C and 40°C and particle sizes  of 
–106+75 µm and –38 µm were selected for mineralogical examination. The 
experimental plots contain between 9 and 10 total points per line distributed  between  
0.5 h and 96 h. The samples were analysed by mounting on stubs and in epoxy for 
SEM energy -dispersi ve X -ray spectroscopy (EDS) and QEMSCAN analysis, 
respectively, using a field emission scanning electron microscope (JEOL -JSM-7001) 
with a Bruker Esprit 1.9 EDS system. The measurement parameters were a 10 -mm 
SDD EDS detector with a 125 -eV resolution, a 20  kV accelerating voltage and a 10 
mm working distance in backscattered electron imaging mode. QEMSCAN 
mineralogical analysis was performed by using an E430 unit with Idiscover 5.2 
software. Target particle maps were developed by initial EDS identification and a 
CSIRO species identification protocol was run (Meyer et al., 2013).

4.3. Results and  discussion  
 
4.3.1.  Kinetic  results  
 
4.3.1.1.  Effect of initial acid concentration  
 
Maximum extractions of ~90% copper were achieved (see Fig. 4 -2a). The most marked  
difference  in copper  extraction  occurred  between  0.1 and 0.5 mol L–1, whereas the 0.05 
mol L–1 solution had a similar dissolution profile to the 0.1 mol L–1 solution. At  acid 
concentrations  below  0.05 mol L–1, the reaction  was almost  entirely  oxidative, and the 
role of the acid was to prevent iron  hydrolysis.  
 
4.3.1.2.  Effect of initial iron(III)  concentration  
 
Figure 4 -2b shows the effect of changes in ferric -ion conc entration on copper 
extraction at 90°C (baseline temperature). As expected, the presence of an oxidant is 
mandatory for bornite dissolution. Experiments without oxidant showed that bornite 
did not react with acid during the first 48 h and reacted only slig htly after this time. A 
significant decrease in copper extraction resulted for ferric concentrations below 1.25 
mol L–1 and the increase in copper extraction was small for an increase in ferric 
concentration above 1.5 mol L–1, which implies an independence  from oxidant 
concentration above this value. Copper extraction was faster during the first 2 h of 
reaction  for all concentrations,  slowed  down  after 4 h of reaction  and reached  a plateau 
for concentrations below 1.25 mol L–1. Concentrations above 1.5 mol L–1 provided an 
excess of oxidant and complete dissolution was expected; Pesic and Olson (1983) 
found  this dependence  more  evident  during  the early  stages  of the reaction,  with a first- 
order dependence on oxidant concentration during the first 30 min of  leaching.  
 
4.3.1.3.  Effect of particle  size 
 
The inverse dependence of particle size and copper dissolution is shown in Fig. 4 -2c. 
Within  the first 2 h, a copper  dissolution  of 73% resulted  for the –38 µm material,  and 
this dissolution decreased to 55% for the –106+75 µm material. There was no major 
difference between  particle sizes  below  –100  µm.  A rapid  initial  dissolution  was 
 
129 Chapter 4  
 
 
observed for all grain sizes and the dependence was less than for pure chalcopyrite.  A 
dependence on particle size was found by Ugarte -Alverez (1971) in the first stage of 
the reaction, and this was attributed to a reduction in particle size during the ini tial 
dissolution, but this dependence was more marked with very low oxidant 
concentrations (0.005 mol L–1) (Pesic and Olson, 1983). This behaviour may indicate 
that bornite is a viable candidate target for ISR processing because a very fine grain 
size may not be required to achieve a relatively fast reaction at high ferric -ion 
concentrations. The leaching kinetics showed a significantly slower dissolution for 
chalcopyrite under the same conditions (Hidalgo et al.,  2018).  
 
4.3.1.4.  Effect of  temperature  
 
The effect o f temperature as measured between 40°C and 90°C indicated that two 
copper -extraction scenarios exist (Fig. 4 -2d). The copper extractions for the 40°C  and 
50°C series and the 60°C to 90°C plots are close to each other. However, the two 
groups differ in the maximum copper extracted, with the lower -temperature 
experiments not achieving more than 80% copper dissolution. For all temperatures, the  
copper  extraction  up to ~30%  was rapid  and thereafter,  it trended  toward  a plateau. The  
difference  in extraction  profiles as a function  of temperature  before  and after 30% 
copper  extraction  may indicate  that more  than one reaction  mechanism  occurs  and that 
copper  dissolution  from  chalcopyrite  is more  rapid  above  60°C.  As shown  in previous 
work on chalcopyrite leaching, the reaction kinetics are highly dependent on 
temperature changes and chalcopyrite dissolution increases markedly at higher 
temperatures (Dutrizac, 1981; Hirato et al., 1986). Dreisinger and Abed (2002) 
suggested tha t a difference between transport and chemical -reaction control is a 
noticeable enhancement of reaction kinetics even with small temperature increments, 
and mild changes in the separation between plots result from transport processes that 
control  the reacti on. Although  chalcopyrite  is present  in the sample,  the broad  and even 
separation  between  temperature  lines  observed  in previous  work  (Hidalgo  et al., 2018) 
is not evident here, which implies that the bornite dissolution mechanism dominates 
the copper -extraction  kinetics.

4.3.2.  Kinetic  analysis  
 
 
4.3.2.1.  Determination of kinetic parameters by using model -fitted  methods  
 
Empirical kinetic equations for heterogeneous reaction models are typically used to 
understand the reaction mechanism based on kinetic data. The shrinking -core model 
assumes  that the reacting  particle  has a uniform  radius  and is surrounded  by a reactant. 
The reactant penetrates the surface layer and continues into the remaining bulk of the 
particle unti l  the shrinking core disappears. The  heterogeneous  reaction  of  bornite  
 
131 
 
 
 
   
 Chapter 4  
 
 
leaching with acidic ferric chloride solution was modelled by using six different 
empirical  equations  to achieve  a best fit as determined  from  the correlation  coefficient 
(R2). The integrated rate equation g(x) relates the transformed fraction x and its 
variation with time t, where kc is the apparent reaction rate constant, and is given by 
Equation  (9). 
 
𝑔(𝑥) = 𝑘𝑐𝑡 (9) 
 
Table 4 -5 shows the fitting of the experimental data obtained with different  diffusion - 
controlled  and chemical -reaction -controlled  equations.  The best fit (highest  R2 values) 
was obtained for diffusion through a product layer ( R2 ≥ 0.88), despite the poor  fit for 
the initial  reaction  phase.  The deviation  from  the straight -line plots  (Fig.  4-3) suggests 
that a single  mechanism  may not apply  to the entire  reaction  and that copper  extraction 
from  the chalcopyrite  in the samples  may be limited,  especially  at temperatures  below 
60ᵒC. The fit lines were determined with 7 points (including the points between 0 and 
2 h). Similar  behaviour  was found  by the authors  for the leaching  of pure chalcopyrite 
samples at 50ᵒC and 40ᵒC, in which the copper diss olution was slower compared  with 
the composite sample (Hidalgo et al., 2018). Previous studies also suggested that at 
low temperatures, an intermediate copper -mineral phase formation may limit the 
complete extraction of bornite, presumably by the formation  of chalcopyrite or 
covellite (Pesic and Olson,  1983).

To obtain the activation parameters for the shrinking -core model, the best -fit equation 
was selected, and its integrated form is presented in Equations (10) to (11), where x is 
the fraction of reacted solid, τ is the time required to achieve complete conversion of 
the core ( R = 0), kc is the kinetic rate constant and De is the effect ive diffusion

Arrhenius’s law (Equations (12) to (13)) and the Eyring equation (transition -state 
theory, Equations (14) to (15)), were used to calculate the activation parameters, 
including  the activation  energy,  enthalpy  and entropy  (Kuhn,  2000;  Levenspiel,  1999). 
The activation energy was calculated by using the experimental rate constant that  was 
obtained from a plot of ln kc versus 1/T (Fig. 4 -4a). The enthalpy and entropy were 
obtained  from  a plot of T ln (kc/T) versus  T, with ∆H++ being  derived  from  the intercept 
and ΔS++ from the slope (Lente et al., 2005) (Fig.  4-4b).

A final plot of the sample activation parameters is presented in Fig. 4 -4. The apparent 
activation energy obtained from the Arrhenius plot was 79.3 kJ/mol, which is higher 
than that expected for a diffusion -controlled process. The activation energy is slig htly 
higher than previously reported values with the same oxidant, which suggests that the 
presence of chalcopyrite in the system increased the activation energy (see also Table 
4-2). The value is in agreement with that determined by Pesic and Olson (1983)  for 
ferric -chloride  solutions  and temperatures  above  40°C,  and may indicate  that the major 
influence on the thermodynamic behaviour of the sample is the bornite. The  enthalpy  
 − 134

and entropy values from the Eyring plot are 77.3 kJ mol–1 and ₋197.1 J mol –1 K–1, 
respectively. The entropy is very similar to that obtained for chalcopyrite under the 
same conditions and in other systems (Dreisinger and Abed, 2002; Hidalgo et al., 
2018),  and indicates that the reaction is not spontaneous at any temperature.

The reaction orders for the other parameters were calculated from plots of ln  kc versus 
the ln of the parameters of oxidant concentration (CO), particle size (PS) and free 
acidity (FA). ko was found by using the Arrhenius equation (Equation (12)) and the 
methodology presented by Feng et al. (2015a). All values were substituted into the 
kinetic equation of the dissolution kinetics for the composite sample of bornite and 
chalcopyrite,  Equations  (16) and (17),  as follows  (where  lnA is the Arrhenius -equation 
intercept):

Equation 17 provides a formula to represent the shrinking -core model, which best 
describes the dissolution kinetics dependency on temperature, particle size and acid 
and oxidant  concentrations  for the bornite/chalcopyrite  sample.  Diffusion  through  a 
 
135 
Chapter 4  
 
 
product  layer  is the controlling  step in the reaction;  the product  layer  will grow  rapidly 
at a higher temperature and reach a plateau rapidly, as is shown in the experimental 
results.  
 
 
4.3.2.2.  Individual contribution of bornite and chalcopyrite to  copper 
dissolution by using model -fitted  methods  
 
In a composite sample where mineral separation is not possible (e.g., ISR operations) 
the ability to predict the effect of different copper minerals on the copper extractions 
would be extremely useful. The initial copper content of the sample used in this  study 
was distributed between bornite (84.9% copper) and chalcopyrite  (15.8%).  
The copper extracted from the chalcopyrite can be predicted from Hidalgo et al. 
(2018):

1 − (1 − x )3   = 8.3  × 10 CO PS FA exp ( RT ) t (18) 
 
The calculated copper extracted from chalcopyrite was subtracted from the total copper 
extracted to determine the copper extracted from pure bornite. The activation 
parameters for pure bornite were calculated by using the Arrhenius and Eyring plots, 
and a kinetic  semi -empirical  equation  was determined  for pure bornite  (Equation  (19)).  
 
 2 11 0.79   −0.72   2.52  −72.02  
 
 1 − 3 (1 − x )3  + 2(1 − x )  = 2.58  × 10 CO PS FA exp ( RT ) t (19) 
 
 
 
The activation energy of 72 kJ mol–1 (see Fig. 4 -5) for bornite alone was lower than 
that of the original sample and is close to that obtained in previous work on pure bornite 
(Pesic and Olson (1983). This lower value supports the conclusion that the chalcopyrite 
in the sample increases the e nergy requirement, though only marginally because 
bornite is the main phase that influences the curve shapes, and hence the results align 
more closely with pure bornite kinetic behaviour. In a previous analysis of the role of 
other copper minerals, such as  digenite and chalcopyrite, on bornite dissolution, 
Dutrizac et al. (1971) found that the inclusion of less than 30% chalcopyrite  in samples  
leached  at 70°C  did not change  the shape  of the dissolution  
 
136 Chapter 4  
 
 
plots; however, when large amounts of chalcopyrite were added, at 15°C, the 
dissolution curves deviated from their initial form. The results in this work agree well 
with Dutrizac’s  results,  including  that the average  activation  energy  was affected  only 
slightly  by the presence  of 15.8%  chalcopyrite  in the sample.  These  results  are relevant 
to an ISR scenario  or to application  at a larger  scale,  where  the ratio of minerals  in the 
ore modifies the kinetics and activation energy. The major copper -sulfide phase will 
dictate the leaching kinetics and potentially, as seen for chalcopyrite, limit the 
dissolution  rate.

equation for diffusion through a product layer.  
 
4.3.2.3.  Determination of kinetic parameters by using the time -to-a-given - 
fraction  method  
 
Although the model -fitted method (shrink ing-core model) is used frequently to 
determine activation energies and reaction mechanisms based on empirical equations 
in hydrometallurgical kinetics analysis (as presented in Section 3.2.1), the main 
disadvantage  of this approach  is that an average  activation  energy  is determined,  which 
may obscure the presence of distinct reaction mechanisms. Hence, different reaction 
stages should be identified so that different model equations can be applied to each 
stage. Owing to the presence of both chalcopyrite an d bornite in our samples, we 
expected  a change  in reaction  mechanism,  and we applied  the time-to-a-given -fraction 
method to identify the time when this change occured in our experiments (Fig.  4-6). 
 
137 
Chapter 4  
 
 
 
The time -to-a-given -fraction approach relates the time ( t) required to achieve mineral 
dissolution to the reaction  progress. Equation (20) relates the reacted fraction x and a 
variable time t. The integrated equation, where Ea represents the apparent activation 
energy for the time required to reach a certain reaction progress, is given by Equation 
(21). The slope of t he plot of ln tx versus 1/T was then used to calculate the apparent 
activation energy (Putnis, 1992).

Plots of ln(t) as a function of 1/T for various selected copper extractions are given in 
Fig. 4-6 and show  that the slope  changed  with the reaction  extent.  A small  slope  change 
resulted between 20% and 30% extraction but a major change occurred between 30% 
and 50% copper dissolution. These c hanges in slope suggest that three stages of 
dissolution occur, as a first (below 20% copper dissolution), transition (between 20% 
and 50% copper dissolution) and second stage (above 50% copper dissolution). The 
changes  also suggest  that, between  30% and 50% copper  extraction,  chalcopyrite  starts 
to dissolve and therefore, the activation -energy requirement  increases.

percentages of copper recovery from experimental data ( x = 0.1 to x = 0.7) versus 1/T using 
the time -to-a-given -fraction method for activation -energy determination (the slopes were 
taken from the linearised equations next to each line).  
 
The calculated energies for the original sample are almost constant (similar slope) for 
the first 20% copper dissolution with an apparent activation energy of ~15.7 kJ  mol–1. 
The energy increase d to ~42.2 kJ mol–1 at 30% copper extraction. Activation -energy 
values  for the first stage  of the reaction  varied  between  21 to 51.3 kJ mol–1 for systems 
presented in the literature (see Table 4 -1) and appears to correspond to bornite 
transformation  to a copper -deficient  phase.  Pesic  and Olson  (1983)  also suggested  that 
low temperatures did not result in sulfur production, and therefore, the activat ion 
energy is low (24.78 kJ mol–1) compared with the higher -temperature activation 
energies  (30 kJ mol–1 for 40% extraction  and –76.8 kJ mol–1 for 55% copper  extraction, 
Table 4 -1), as was also noted in the current study. Above 50% copper extraction, the 
activation energy increased slightly from ~76.5 kJ mol–1 to ~78.6 kJ mol–1 and was 
similar to the activation energy determined by the shrinking -core method. After 50% 
copper leaching, the calculated activation energy was similar to those found for 
covellite  (71.5 kJ mol–1 and 74.4 kJ mol–1) (Dutrizac and Macdonald, 1974; Miki et 
al., 2011), which may suggest the possible formation of covellite as an intermediate 
that may slow down the dissolution and increase the activation -energy  requirement.  
 
 
4.3.2.4.  Individual contribution of bornite and chalco pyrite to copper 
dissolution by using the time -to-a-given -fraction  method  
 
Figure 4 -7 provides plots of the theoretical pure bornite (Fig. 4 -7a) and pure 
chalcopyrite (Fig. 4 -7b) leaching using the time -to-a-given -fraction method. The 
change  in activation  energy  between  30% and 50% copper  dissolution  for pure bornite 
leaching sho ws a two -stage mechanism (the mechanism below 30% and above 50% 
copper dissolution differs as shown by the change in slope in Fig. 4 -7a), as has been 
presented previously in other studies with pure bornite (Dutrizac et al., 1970; Pesic and 
Olson, 1983; Uga rte-Alverez, 1971). Previously, these authors identified that 
chalcopyrite  dissolution  under  the same  conditions  resulted  in minimal  changes  in 
 
 
139 Chapter 4  
 
 
measured activation energies, and this is evidenced by the small change in slopes of 
the chalcopyrite curves in Fig. 4 -7b.

Table 4 -6 compares the activation parameters found for chalcopyrite (Hidalgo et al., 
2018), bornite and the composite bornite/chalcopyr ite sample from the Arrhenius, 
Eyring  and time-to-a-given -fraction  methods.  The presence  of chalcopyrite  had only a 
 
140 
Chapter 4  
 
 
small impact on the activation energy, and the contribution by bornite dominates. 
Therefore, the chalcopyrite in the original sample did not affect the dissolution rate 
significantly (as evidenced by the similar slopes of the chalcopyrite dissolution lines  
in Fig. 4 -7b) and as was also noticed by Dutrizac et al. (1971) for samples with a 
chalcopyrite content of up to 30%.

As evidenced by the kinetic data, two stages of bornite dissolution were identified 
(below 30% and above 50% copper dissolution) and several XRD analyses were 
performed during the reaction to obtain an indication of the intermediate and product 
phases.  Sphalerite  and chalcopyrite,  which  were  present  in the initial  sample,  were  also 
present in the final sample. Therefore, complete copper recovery was not achieved 
from the chalcopyrite after 8 hours of leaching (see Fig. 4 -8). Because this study 
focused on co pper dissolution, detailed sphalerite leaching data are not presented, but 
chemical analysis confirmed that zinc was present in solution. For example, at  40°C,  
 
141 Chapter 4  
 
 
56.2 %, 74.9% and 91.5% of the sphalerite had leached at 6 h, 8 h and 15 h, 
respectively.  
 
After 8 h, elemental sulfur was formed. An early reaction sample (30 min) showed  no 
evidence of sulfur (Table 4 -7), and the only product that was identified was an 
interm ediate copper mineral that showed peak overlaps with chalcopyrite although 
solution chemistry indicated that copper was dissolved preferentially over iron. This 
mineral could not be classified as idaite based on XRD data only, as also shown by 
Ugarte  and Burkin  (1975).  Because  chalcopyrite  was present  in the initial  sample,  it is 
not possible for us to conclude whether chalcopyrite was a reaction  product.

4.3.3.2.  SEM  analysis  
 
The initial bornite particles were intact without any visible alteration product. The 
internal  composition  determined  by SEM -EDS  was constant  through  the entire  particle 
for bornite and chalcopyrite. Textural changes to the bornite particle surface from 0.5 
h to 8 h leaching  for –106+75  µm particles  at 90°C  are shown  in Fig. 4-9. It is possible 
to see sulfur forming, which encapsulated the particles after a period  of time. In the 
first hour of the reaction, sulfur formation commenced via the development of a 
“beehive” or “skeletal” texture with internal openings that penetrated the particle via 
dissolution and generated cracks. After 2 h of reaction, a non -globular  sulfur layer 
coated the particles and appeared to thicken after 4 h of reaction. As the experimental 
sampling times exceeded the time for 30% copper dissolution, sulfur production was 
evident.  After  6 h of reaction,  the particle  appeared  to be replaced  entirely  with sulfur.

mol L–1) solution at 90ᵒC (from a to f,  respectively).  
 
The sulfur that coated the bornite particles appeared thick and not globular and may 
slow the diffusion of  reactants. Figure 4 -10 provides a comparative image of same - 
size chalcopyrite  and bornite  particles  that were  leached  under  the same  conditions  for 
8 h. The chalcopyrite sulfur layer did not show textural changes with time and had 
evident porosity under the microscope. In contrast, the sulfur formed on bornite had 
an undefined form and the particle was encapsulated after 4 h of reaction. The 
diffe rence in sulfur appearance may explain the different kinetic mechanisms found 
by the shrinking -core model  for chalcopyrite  and bornite  under  the same  experimental 
conditions, namely, chemical control for chalcopyrite and diffusion through a  product 
layer f or bornite. If the sulfur coating is thick and apparently impermeable, transport 
through the product layer may control the reaction. A similar tight sulfur layer was 
found for chalcopyrite in sulfate systems and transport through a sulfur product layer 
has been  suggested  as a kinetics  control  step (Dutrizac  et al., 1969;  Munoz  et al., 1979). 
Majima et al. (1985) found that the sulfur layer formed in ferric -chloride solution  was 
considerably less dense (and therefore more porous) than that produced in ferric  
sulfate. It appears that the effect of the chloride on the texture of the produced sulfur 
is minor for bornite and, therefore, the sulfur coating is comparable to that found in 
sulfate systems for  chalcopyrite.

The particle composition as a function of reaction time was studied by using polished 
cross -sections that were mounted in resin, with selected points studied by SEM -EDS. 
Images  from  0.5 h to 8 h leaching  are shown  in Fig. 4-11 and the normalised  chemical 
compositions are listed in Table 4 -8. During the first 0.5 h of leaching, the particles 
were covered with small cracks from the sulfur at the surface into the center of the 
grains, which may have facilitated the mass transfer between the unreacted core and 
the solution.  According  to the chemical  composition,  almost  50% copper  was lost from 
the original  bornite  during  the initial  0.5 h. The iron-to-sulfur  ratios  remained  constant 
during the first hour of the reaction. The new mineral that formed varied in 
composition  from  Cu3.1FeS 3.8 to Cu2.8FeS 4, Within  the first half hour,  the initial  bornite 
was replaced by a copper -deficient mineral and sulfur formation commenced. Afte r 4 
h, almost the entire particle was replaced by sulfur and only small fragments of 
intermediate phase  remained.  
These findings agree with those of Pesic and Olson (1983), who found that after 49% 
copper  dissolution,  the residue  composition  was 51.0%  copper,  14.0%  iron and 30.5% 
sulfur.  Dutrizac  et al. (1970)  described  two different  products  that formed  before  sulfur 
in a sulfate -system, namely, non -stochiometric bornite with a composition of 
Cu4.29Fe0.99S4 and a copper -deficient mineral with a composi tion between Cu 3.0FeS 4 
and Cu 3.2FeS 4. This study also reported covellite grains and chalcopyrite lamellae as 
products.

After  30 min leaching  at 40°C,  no sulfur  was detected.  Instead,  the surface  texture  was 
similar to that of the original bornite but with small surface cracks, and the mineral 
composition did not correspond to the original bornite, but its composition was in 
agreement  with the copper -deficient  mineral  formed  at high temperature.  Cracks  in the 
particle surface are believed to result from a volume reduction during the initial stage 
of the reaction  (Dutrizac  et al., 1985;  Pesic  and Olson,  1983).  SEM  images  of the low- 
temperature intermediate  product  provide a good  indication of the first s tage of  the 
147 
Chapter 4  
 
 
reaction where a small amount of copper was dissolved into solution and the entire 
particle changed into a copper -deficient mineral and yielded a friable and cracked 
particle without evident particle -surface changes. This result supports the fact that the 
control mechanism suggested by the shrinking -core model does not fit the low - 
temperature kinetics very well. Therefore, the time -to-a-given -fraction methodology 
is advantageous due to its independence of a selected model for the leaching 
mechanism, compar ed with the empirical equation model.  
The role of chalcopyrite in the sample has been discussed from a kinetics perspective 
(section 4.3.2.). Some of the particles were composed of chalcopyrite and bornite, 
which  provided  an opportunity  to identify  differe nces in dissolution  between  these  two 
minerals under the same conditions, as would be expected, for example, in an ISR 
environment, where the minerals co -exist and interact differently with the solution. 
Figure  4-12 shows  the chemical  composition  and internal changes  for a mixed -particle 
cross -section mount pre - and post -leaching at 90°C for 6 h. The initial sulfur 
compositions of the bornite and chalcopyrite differed slightly from the theoretical 
values (Pesic and Olson, 1983). The average bornite composit ion was 67.3% copper, 
13.6% iron and 19.0% sulfur and for chalcopyrite the average was 34.0% copper, 
31.5% iron and 32.9% sulfur. Chalcopyrite appeared to be intact after leaching, with 
no evident cracks or changes in the surface texture. The composition d id not vary 
significantly. The bornite composition changed significantly after the reaction, with 
the internal texture appearing to be composed of bornite interspersed with sulfur. The 
composition of the cross -section leached particle varied from 58.3% cop per, 18.0% 
iron and 23.7% sulfur to 49.0% copper, 11.8% iron and 39.2% sulfur, respectively. 
After two hours of reaction, the chalcopyrite did not dissolve further, more than 50% 
of the copper in bornite was dissolved and the particles were covered in sulf ur. 
Therefore,  it is possible  to say that, for this sample,  the energies  calculated  for the first 
30% copper dissolution by the time -to-a-given -fraction method are applicable to just 
bornite without the influence of chalcopyrite in the  sample.

after the partial dissolution of bornite, and by elemental sulfur. Points 119 and 122 showed a

(without changes from the unreacted composition).  
 
4.3.3.3.  QEMSCAN  analysis  
 
QEMSCAN particle mapping was used as an alternative technique to identify the 
intermediate phases formed by inferred chemical compositions. Figure 4 -13 pre sents 
a partial map of the pre - and post -leached bornite and chalcopyrite in the sample 
analysed  by SEM -EDS.  An initial  content  of 2.47%  of a mineral  with the composition 
of idaite was identified in the original sample, which could be oxidised bornite, as 
identified  in several  natural  bornite  mineralisation  zones  (Hatert,  2005).  After  30 min, 
the initial  content  of bornite  was replaced  almost  entirely  with a secondary  unidentified 
copper  mineral,  with a composition  that was not consistent  with idaite  or chalcopyrite, 
however, chalcocite/digenite existed in a reduced group of particles as a  mixed 
intergrowth with the secondary copper mineral. Covellite was not ide ntified in the 
sample. As expected, the chalcopyrite particles remained unchanged. Furthermore, 
under the leaching conditions used in these experiments, quartz was not expected to 
react, and therefore, quartz was used as a standard to measure the ratio of change in 
sample  composition.  The normalised  data for the copper  and iron mineral  chemical  
 
149 
Chapter 4  
 
 
compositions of the initial sample and after 30 min of reaction are presented in Table 
4-9. As expected, the bornite content was reduced by almost 88%, a new copper - 
sulfide phase of variable composition formed during this time and no production of 
idaite with a composition similar to that of the original sample resulted. There was a 
net decrease in chalcopyrite content, which suggests that some chalcopyrite started to 
dissolve, which also supports the conclusion that it is unlikely that chalcopyrite was 
generated.

4.4. Conclusions  
 
This study  complements  previous  data on bornite  leaching  in ferric -chloride  and MSA 
solutions,  provides  new information  on the dissolution  behaviour  of composite  mineral 
samples and presents a new kinetic -analysis methodology. The main conclusions  are: 
 
• The leaching of a composite bornite/chalcopyrite sample exhibited a low 
dependence on acid and oxidant concentrations, and the or der of dependence of the 
bornite on ferric concentration was higher than that for chalcopyrite alone. MSA  
alone  did not dissolve  the copper  in bornite  within  48 h without  the presence of an 
oxidant. Therefore, ferric chloride is the active oxidant in the reaction and the MSA 
prevents iron hydrolysis by maintaining a low pH. The dissolution was temperature 
dependent, particularly for temperatures below  60°C.  
 
• The kinetic mechani sm for the composite bornite/chalcopyrite sample leaching 
was found  to be diffusion  through  a sulfur  product  layer  and the average  activation 
energy was calculated to be 79.3 kJ mol–1 by using the shrinking -core model.  
 
• The leaching mechanism of the compos ite sample varied during the reaction and, 
therefore, the time -to-a-given -fraction kinetics analysis was used to obtain the 
kinetic  parameters.  Three  reaction  stages  were  identified  for the composite  sample:  
151 Chapter 4  
 
 
for copper dissolutions below 20% the activation energy was 15.7 kJ mol–1, 
between 20% and 50% it was 42.2 kJ mol–1 and above 50% it exceeded 76.5 kJ 
mol–1. Bornite leached with a two -stage reaction mechanism; the first stage 
appeared to be the conversion of bornite into an intermediate without sulfur 
formation  (13.5  kJ mol–1) and a second  stage  occurred  after the sulfur  formed  (70.4 
kJ mol–1). The activation energies obtained were similar to those of the composite 
sample, which indicated that the bornite l eaching mechanism dominated the 
composite sample kinetics behaviour. The presence of chalcopyrite in the initial 
sample increased the activation energy between the 30% and 40% copper 
extractions.  
 
• Mineralogical analyses of the resulting phases showed that the final reaction 
product was sulfur. An intermediate product was identified by chemical  
composition (Cu 3FeS 4). Chalcopyrite existed in the final residue, but because of  
its presence in the initial sample, it was not possible to confirm whether it was an 
intermediate reaction  product.  
 
• Based  on the cumulative  information,  it is possible  to differentiate  bornite  leaching 
into a rapid  dissolution  step where  the initial  bornite  forms  a copper -deficient  phase 
with the same  iron-to-sulfur  ratio,  and an intermediate  ‘idaite -type’  copper  mineral 
with a low activation energy (Equation 1). The second stage involves initial  sulfur 
formation, and this coating results in a higher energy requirement for further 
dissolution (Equation 2). When the remaining partic le is covered in sulfur, the 
activation energy exceeds 70 kJ mol–1 and the reaction is slower due to the 
formation of a low -permeable sulfur layer (Equations (2) to  (7).

Chapter 5. Replacement reactions of copper sulfides at moderate 
temperature in acidic solutions  
 
Understanding mineral transformations of composite copper –sulfide ores and the 
associated  reaction  mechanism  at low to medium  temperatures  in acidic  solutions  with 
oxidant restriction is important for in -situ recovery (ISR) operations because natural 
ore b odies typically comprise multiple sulfide species and their dissolution is oxidant 
consuming. However, the relevant reactions have scarcely been investigated. Here  we 
present  experimental  observations  on mineral  replacement  reactions  of coarse -grained 
natural bornite –chalcocite samples in acidic solutions at 90°C and in the absence of 
oxidant. Transformations were found to follow a three -stage reaction sequence for 
bornite and one -stage for chalcocite. Bornite replacement commenced with t he 
formation of digenite along fractures and surfaces. Bornite –digenite interfaces were 
sharp  and digenite  rims contained  nanochannels  that connected  to the original  bornite. 
When copper dissolution exceeded 30%, copper -deficient lamellae exsolved from the  
bornite by solid -state diffusion; this texture appeared only in stronger acidic solutions 
with extended  times  and did not occur  in heating  experiments  without  fluid.  Chalcocite 
that was present together with bornite in the unreacted samples transformed in to 
digenite characterised by laminar replacement textures. Finally, all phases were 
replaced by covellite accompanied by the formation of porosity. These replacements 
showed the concomitant operation of fluid -induced solid -state diffusion and fluid - 
mediat ed mineral replacement by coupled dissolution –precipitation reactions. The 
textures found in the resulting covellite showed a promising increase in porosity that 
could be beneficial for hard -rock ISR and suggest a pathway for refractory sulfide 
processing by acid  pre-treatment.  
5.1. Introduction  
 
The recent decline in the frequency of discovered high -grade Cu deposits paired with 
stricter environmental regulations has encouraged the evaluation of alternative 
approaches  for Cu extraction  including  in-situ recover y (ISR)  (Sinclair  and Thompson, 
2015).  Chalcopyrite  and bornite  represent  the major  proportion  of currently  known  Cu 
resources (Zhao et al., 2015) and are thus of particular interest for ISR (Hidalgo et  al., 
2019a;  Hidalgo  et al., 2019b).  In natural  ore, chalcopyrite  and bornite  are commonly  
162 Chapter 5  
 
 
associated  with secondary  sulfides,  including  chalcocite,  digenite,  and covellite.  Since 
targeting of specific minerals during ISR operating in complex composite natural 
deposits  is nearly  impossible,  the reactions  between  the lixiviant  and secondary  sulfide 
minerals must also be considered.  
The hydrothermal enrichment of Cu by hydrothermal alteration of chalcopyrite and 
bornite into readily leachable minerals in the presence of copper sulfate or oxygen in 
acidic solutions and the possible viability of secondary sulfides as pre -treatment or 
purification processes have been addressed previously by Fuentes et al. (2009) and 
Cerda et al. (2017) . Under a variety of experimental conditions, both minerals were 
replaced by secondary copper -enriched phases, such as chalcocite, digenite and 
covellite (Bartlett, 1992; Muszer et al., 2013; Pesic and Olson, 1984). However, for 
the successful implementation of ISR, such sulfide mineral replacement reactions 
require further investigation under realistic conditions, including the effects of 
multiple reactant s in composite samples, at medium to elevated temperatures, with 
coarse grained solids and restricted oxidant supply. In case of ISR, dissolution and 
precipitation of secondary Cu phases along the fluid (lixiviant and/or pregnant 
solution)  flow paths  and in the primary  target  zone  may delay  or enhance  the recovery 
of Cu (Mallio et al., 1981). Hence, a better understanding of conditions that result in 
the formation of product layers on primary Cu -sulfide minerals and downstream  from 
the lixiviant injection z one and the potential effect on porosity/permeability is critical 
for the implementation of ISR  schemes.  
The generation of secondary sulfide layers has been attributed to solid -state diffusion, 
and is described as the removal or replacement of certain ions  while the underlying 
framework structure remains unaltered, e.g., chalcocite transformation into digenite 
and covellite by preferential dissolution of copper from the original phase (Burkin, 
1969). Such ‘solid -state’ processes are broadly accepted as the mechanism of 
‘leaching’  a metal  from  an ore body.  However,  in some  cases,  the replacement  textures 
exhibit characteristics inconsistent with this mechanism, including replacement rates 
at moderate to low temperature, dependence on fluid composition, and a lack of 
diffusion profiles across replacement interfaces. Instead, these characteristics a re 
indicative of fluid -driven mineral replacement by dissolution –precipitation reactions, 
as demonstrated for numerous systems (Altree -Williams et al., 2015; Hellmann et al., 
2003; Putnis, 2002; Putnis and Putnis, 2007; Ruiz -Agudo et al., 2012; Ruiz -Agudo  et 
163 Chapter 5  
 
 
al., 2014) and demonstrated through the incorporation of species from a ‘doped’ 
solution in the secondary mineral (Geisler et al., 2005; Hövelmann et al., 2010; 
Labotka et al., 2002; Niedermeier et al., 2009).  
Furthermore,  recent observations suggest that the textures and chemical compositions 
of sulfide assemblages are consistent with mineral replacement by dissolution – 
precipitation  reactions.  For example,  Zhao  et al. (2014)  investigated  the fluid -mediated 
replacement  of chalcopyrite  by Cu-rich bornite  between  200°C  and 320°C  in cuprous - 
chloride  buffered  solutions.  Cai et al. (2011)  described  pseudomorphic  replacement  of 
chalcopyrite by Cl -bearing covellite and nantokite in acidic CuCl solutions below 
100°C. In both examples, the solid product phases were characterised by an elevated 
porosity, which allowed for continued fluid transport to the reaction  front.  
The minera logical  changes  in bornite  (Cu 5FeS 4) in the presence  of ferric  oxidants  have 
been  reviewed  by Dutrizac  et al. (1985).  In this analysis,  bornite  dissolution  was found 
to be non-stoichiometric,  which  resulted  in the formation  of a Cu-deficient  phase  with 
a composition of Cu 3FeS 4. The phase was also identified by Ugarte -Alverez (1971), 
and was suggested to result from the extraction of ionically bound Cu atoms during 
the first stage of reaction, which leave behind a chalcopyrite -like unit cell that 
conserves the sulfur packing. Chalcocite dissolution in HCl at low to medium 
potentials (0 to 0.6 mV vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)) was accompanied by 
the formation of several transient phases defined as Cu 2-xS. Covellite has been found 
to be the fina l product after sustained reaction of bornite and chalcocite in acidic 
solutions (Parikh and Liddell, 1990; Pesic and Olson, 1984). The transformation of 
primary  Cu sulfides  into covellite  occurs  with or without  the presence  of oxygen  (Pesic 
and Olson, 198 4; Price and Chilton, 1980; Price and Chilton, 1981) and has been 
attributed to the preferential dissolution of  iron. 
Bornite (Cu 5FeS 4), chalcopyrite (CuFeS 4) and digenite (Cu 1.8S) have a common 
structure based on the sphalerite stacking principle, which consists of cubic close - 
packing sulfur with alternative cation sites occupied. Chalcocite (Cu 2S) has a 
hexagonal sulfur close -packing with movable copper cations, Finally, the covellite 
structure  is not described in terms of sulfur close -packing but is a coordinated copper 
layers  that  are  limited  by  sulfur  dimers  and  parallel  to  the  hexagonal  c-axis 
 
 
 
164 Chapter 5  
 
 
(Makovicky, 2006). Thus, transformations from any of the other phases into covellite 
require a complete recrystallisation of the original phase.  
To investigate  further  the reactions  that occur  along  a reaction  path from  initial  bornite 
and/or chalcocite to the final covellite at conditions relevant to ISR schemes, we 
present  results  from  an experimental  study  conducted  at 90°C, in acidic  conditions  and 
with low concentrations  of dissolved  oxygen.  We used a coarse  composite  natura l Cu- 
sulfide starting material to mimic the conditions anticipated during  ISR. 
 
 
5.2. Materials and  methods  
 
5.2.1.  Experimental  procedure  
 
Experiments were conducted in 250 mL Nalgene bottles in a shaking water bath at 
90°C with a constant speed of 150 rpm. Sample charges consisted of one cuboid cut 
from  the bulk sulfide  sample  and 100 mL reactive  fluid.  Reactive  fluids  were  prepared 
from deionised water and analytical -grade hydrochloric acid (HCl) and 
methanesulfonic  acid (MSA)  at concentrations  of 0.5 mol L–1 without  oxidant  addition. 
The initial pH and Eh were 0.85 and 0.66, and 300 and 350 mV (vs. S. H. E), 
respectively. R eaction durations were 8 days, two weeks and 30 days. To minimize the  
amount  of dissolved  oxygen,  nitrogen  was bubbled  continuously  into the solutions for 
3 hours before the experiments. Due to the production of H 2S during the experiments,  
intermittent  pressure  release  was necessary  by venting  the gas and further bubbling of 
nitrogen directly into the fluid (tubing insertion) to flush the headspace. After  the 
experiment,  fluids  were  sampled  through  a 0.45 µm syringe  filter  and diluted for 
inductively coupled plasma -optical emission spectrometer (ICP -OES) analysis. Solid 
samples were washed three times with deionised water and dried overnight in a closed 
standard oven at 30°C. Additional dry runs were performed under the same con ditions 
for comparison. The cuboid sample was placed in an empty Nalgene  bottle flushed with 
nitrogen every 24 h and the bottle was placed in a closed incubator at 90˚C. The dry 
runs were run for 8 days, 2 weeks and 30  days.

5.2.2.  Analytical  methods  
 
Characterisation of initial material was performed by a combination of methods, 
including  optical  microscopy,  quantitative  evaluation  of minerals  by scanning  electron 
microscopy (QEMSCAN), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron  backscatter 
diffraction (EBSD) and X -ray diffractometry (XRD) at the CSIRO Characterisation 
Laboratories, Western Australia. The samples were mounted in epoxy, polished and 
carbon coated prior to SEM analysis. A Nikon Eclipse EV100N POL  microscope was 
used for optical imaging. Backscattered electron (BSE) and secondary electron (SE) 
imaging and energy -dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses were conducted using a 
JEOL -JSM-7001 SEM fi tted with a Bruker XFlash EDS system. SEM EDS spectra 
were collected at analysis points separated by at least 5 µm and the chemical 
compositions were calculated by averaging at least 35 points. Analyses of standard 
reference materials were carried out for quality control. Phase identification was 
performed on the polished surfaces using an E430 QEMSCAN at a 0.98 µm pixel 
spacing,  and a PANalytical  Empyrean  X-ray diffractometer  equipped  with a cobalt  X- 
ray tube operating at 40 kV, 40 mA, an incident monochr omator, 0.5° divergence  slit, 
and 0.02 rad soller slits. EDS mapping and EBSD measurements were undertaken 
using  a Zeiss  Ultra  plus SEM  fitted  with an Oxford  Symmetry  EBSD  and X-max EDS. 
High resolution maps and point analyses were collected at 5 keV to mi nimise the 
excitation volume and to obtain results for areas with fine textures. For the EBSD 
work, the SEM was typically operated at around 20 keV and 10 nA which gave a 
reasonable compromise of resolution, speed and beam damage to the  sample.  
Scanning tr ansmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging and EDS mapping was 
applied to specific samples for high -resolution investigation of the product –parent 
interfaces.  Sample  preparation  was performed  by focused  ion beam  (FIB)  cutting  using 
the FEI Helios Nanolab G3 CX DualBeam FIB/SEM at the Centre for Microscopy, 
Characterisation and Analysis (CMCA), The University of Western Australia. STEM 
analyses were performed with the Titan G2 80 -200 TEM at 200 kV at CMCA using a 
double tilt spe cimen holder. Fluids were sampled after selected times of 4 h, 6 h, and 
from  1 to 30 days,  and were  analysed  for Cu, Fe and S using  the Varian  Vista -Pro ICP-

5.2.3.  Starting  material  
 
Natural Cu sulfide was cut and polished to form cuboid fragments with edge lengths 
of approximately 4 mm and an average mass of 0.34 g. The starting material was 
analysed for its mineral and chemical compositions by SEM -EDS, QEMSCAN and 
XRD  (Fig.  5-1). The analysis  of the starting  material  showed  that the sulfide  cubes  had 
a homogeneous sur face with minor cracks (Fig. 5 -2) and well -defined grain 
boundaries, and were mainly composed of bornite (Cu 5FeS 4) (47% ± 1.3%) and 
chalcocite (Cu 2S) (20.6% ± 1.6%). Minor phases included chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) 
(2.3%  ± 0.8%),  pyrite  (FeS 2) (0.95%  ± 0.4%),  tennantite  (Cu 12As4S13) (1.7%  ± 0.7%),  
quartz (21.2% ± 2.1%), and negligible amounts of covellite (CuS) (0.1% ± 0.07%). 
The average chemical composition of the sulfide phases in the starting material were 
close to the theoretical values of bornite (Cu 63.7%, Fe 12.1%, S 24.5%) and chalcocite  
(Cu 79.9%,  S 20.1%).  Sulfide  minerals  in the starting  material  did not show evidence 
of compositional zonation in any of the major  phases.

5.3. Results  
 
5.3.1.  Copper and iron dissolu tion rates  
 
The experiments resulted in the release of Cu and Fe from the solids into the fluids. 
The percentages of Cu and Fe dissolved from the original samples in different acids 
for extended and reduced reaction times are plotted in Fig. 5 -3. The shape s of the 
dissolution curve are similar for HCl and MSA, though a faster rate was obtained in 
the HCl solution.  Iron release  was faster  than copper  during  the first ~72 h, at 12% for 
HCl and 4% for MSA  solutions.  The increase  continued  at slower  pace from  ~100  h 
 
168 
Chapter 5  
 
 
to ~600 h (Fig. 5 -3c and f). A measurable release of Cu commenced after 6 hours, 
increased continuously until ~300 h and remained constant for longer experiment 
durations. A maximum of 38% of copper was dissolved in HCl and 23% in MSA 
solutions.

5.3.2.  Solid transformations  
 
Under the experimental conditions, only bornite and chalcocite zones of the sample 
experienced  mineralogical transformations. Chalcopyrite, although present at low 
percentage in some of the samples, showed minor replacement by digenite in the HCl 
solutions  along  fractures.  For the purposes  of this research,  only bornite  and chalcocite 
transformatio ns are discussed.  The compositions  of the starting  material  and secondary 
phases are summarised in Table 5 -1 and plotted in Fig. 5 -4. Chemical formulae were 
calculated on a 4 -sulfur and 1 -sulfur basis (sulfur atoms constant) depending whether 
it formed after bornite or chalcocite as required for  comparison.

5.3.2.1.  Chalcocite  replacement  
 
Of the two major sulfide phases in the solid reactant (chalcocite and bornite), 
chalcocite was the first to show signs of replacement. The optical image in Fig. 5 -5a 
shows that chalcocite developed a reflection discolouration to light blue after 8 days 
of reaction time in MSA. This change in reflection colour was related to the removal 
of Cu during formation of dark blue lamellar digenite zones in the parent chalcocite 
(Fig. 5 -5b). This change in composition and mineralogy was confirmed by  SEM -EDS 
and XRD d ata. The transformation of chalcocite to digenite occurred more readily in 
the HCl solutions and after 8 days, iron free digenite (Fig. 5 -5c) BSE imaging and 
EBSD analyses indicated the preservation of morphology and orientation during the 
replacement with out the formation of detectable  porosity.  
For the extended experimental times, all MSA samples and HCl samples showed the 
formation of additional covellite. Initially, covellite replaced digenite along fractures 
and subsequently  replaced  the entire  digenit e areas.  Complete  replacement  of digenite 
by covellite coincided with the reaction duration that was characterised by a constant 
Cu concentration in the fluid. The covellite had a fine grain size, and showed 
significant porosity and abundant shrinkage frac tures (Fig. 5 -5d). For the one -month 
HCl experiments, 34.7% covellite was present in the solid compared with 2.7% 
covellite in the solid for the experiment with MSA. Solid compositions are presented 
in Table  5-1.

boundaries.  d. Covellite  formation  after one-month  reaction  in HCl showing  abundant  porosity

5.3.2. 2. Bornite  dissolution  
 
Bornite replacement was found to be consistently slower than that of chalcocite in 
MSA  and HCl.  For example,  bornite  replacement  commenced  in the HCl solution  only 
after 8 days. Generally, the textures and compositions of secondary phases formed 
from bornite evolved through three different stages. MSA solutions only showed one 
of these  stages.  
172 
Chapter  5 
 
 
During  the first stage,  bornite  replacement  was restricted  to the sample  surface  and the 
vicinity of fractures in the bornite, i.e., the contact zones with the reactive fluid, and 
resulted in the formation of secondary digenite (Fig. 5 -6a). The composition of 
digenite after bornite was distinct from digenite after chalcocite because of its  higher 
Fe content of ~0.8 at.% (Table 5 -1), which placed it in the digenite –bornite solid 
solution region (Bn 4Dg96) (Fig. 5 -4). This zone was identified as 5 a ‘digenite solid 
solution’, and was characterised by a cubic low -digenite structure with an Fe co ntent 
between 0.4 at.% and 1.6 at.% (Grguric and Putnis, 1999). The digenite rims along 
cracks  and the sample  surface  showed  a consistent  thickness  of ~2.5 µm after 2 weeks 
and reached ~3.5 µm after one month in the MSA solution. At this time, covellite 
nucleation commenced. In the HCl solution, the digenite rim width reached ~2 µm 
after 8 days and ~3.7 µm after 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, digenite formation ceased and 
the reaction started to form secondary covellite. All experiments developed sharp 
concentration  changes  across  the reaction  interfaces  between  the bornite  and secondary 
digenite  (Fig.  5-6b and c). STEM  high-angle  annular  dark field (HAADF)  images  and 
STEM -EDS show that the interface and concentration change was sharp on the 
nanometre scale (Fig. 5 -7). Furthermore, STEM -HAADF investigation also showed 
that the replacement  was accompanied  by the protrusion  of flame -shaped  digenite  from 
the reaction interface into  the precursor  bornite.

and does not show exsolution  textures.

EDS concentration profile across the interface. The replacement interface between bornite 
(dark grey) and digenite zones (light grey) coincides with a sharp concentration change in Fe 
and Cu. The arrow in the STEM -HAADF image depicts the trace of the EDS line scan.  
 
After two weeks of reaction in HCl solution, the second stage of bornite replacement 
was characterised by the termination of digenite formation from bornite and the 
devel opment of a basket -weave exsolution texture in the bornite. Dry runs of the 
experiments did not show this exsolution texture under otherwise identical conditions 
and durations. Optical microscopy, SEM and QEMSCAN showed that bornite 
exsolved  into two distinct phases  with a texture  consistent  with exsolution  from  bornite 
(Fig. 5 -8 to Fig. 5 -10). Element mapping showed that the two exsolved phases were 
Cu-richer and Cu -poorer. Figure 5 -9 also shows digenite replacing bornite along a 
fracture.  Broad -beam  SEM -EDS analysis  suggests  that the average  composition  of this 
altered bornite was copper -deficient compared with the original bornite and had a 
chemical formula ~Cu 3FeS 4, which is close to that reported from previous bornite 
leaching studies and has been identified as copper -deficient bornite or ‘idaite’ 
(Dutrizac et al., 1985; Pesic and Olson, 1983; Ugarte and Burkin, 1975). This  average 
composition is labelled X -Bn3 in Fig. 5 -4. The two exsolved phases had approximate 
compositions of Cu 4.58Fe0.52S4 (X-Bn2 in Fig. 5 -4) and Cu 2.6Fe1.98S4 (X-Bn1 in Fig. 5 - 
4), respectively (Table 5 -1). Given the fine size of the exsolution texture, the 
compositions determined by SEM -EDS rep orted in Table 5 -1 should be considered  as 
approximate.   The  Cu -poor  lamellae   had   a   composition   close   to  mooihoekite  
 
175 
Chapter 5  
 
 
(Cu 9Fe9S16), which was found by Wang et al. (2018) during bornite bioleaching and 
preceded the formation of chalcopyrite. Similar textures have been described from 
bornite  solid  solutions  after dry annealing  and quenching  experiments  (Brett  and Yund, 
1964; Grguric and Putnis, 1999; Zhao et al., 2017) and in natural ores (Ciobanu et al., 
2017; Hatert,  2005).

Additional EBSD analyses indicate that the Cu -enriched matrix of the exsolution 
texture was composed of orthorhombic bornite, whereas the Cu -deficient lamellae 
were composed of cubic bornite. The inverse pole map of the two phases i ndicates a 
preferred orientation to the 001 plane of the orthorhombic bornite and that the cubic 
bornite was orientated preferentially to the 010 plane. Point XRD results and EBSD 
map of the exsolution are presented in Appendix D.

unreacted bornite.  
 
The third  stage  of the bornite  reaction  sequence  was the increase  in covellite  formation, 
which was characterised by the replacement of earlier -formed digenite and the 
exsolved copper -deficient  texture in  the bornite.  In our experiments,  only  the solids  
 
177 
Chapter 5  
 
 
leached with HCl reached this stage. The replacement of the rims went almost to 
completion and only relics of digenite were present in covellite after one month. At 
this time, more than 38% of the initial Cu in the system was dissolved in the fluid  and 
covellite formed a major part of the sample. In contrast, reaction for one month in MSA  
formed  chalcocite  rims without  concomitant  exsolution  from  bornite  (Fig.  5-11).

Despite extensive reaction, the former shape of the sulfide cuboids was preserved in 
all experiments. In optical photomicrographs, the covellite displays a dark -blue 
reflection colour and a relatively porous texture. Compared with the earlier digenite, 
covellite rims around fractures and at the sample surfaces were generally thicker and 
ranged from ~25 µm after two weeks to ~40 µm after one month of reaction (Fig.  12a 
to d). This implies that, at this stage of reaction, covellite not only formed from the 
precursor digenite but also directly from bornite. In contrast to digenite and covellite 
after chalcocite, covellite that formed after bornite contained  detectable  Fe  (~0.2%;

interfaces. The orientation of these fractures aligned with the orientation of the 
exsolution (Fig. 5 -12e and f).

5.4. Discussion  
 
5.4.1.  Replacement mechanism  
 
Diverse transformations were observed during the replacements of chalcocite and 
bornite in acidic solutions at 90 °C. Owing the chosen temperature, the experimental 
observations should be directly relevant to ISR. The observed reaction textures are 
indicative for concomitantly operating solid -state diffusion and mineral replacement 
by dissolution –precipitation reaction s. Although solid -state diffusion is generally 
considered slow, cation diffusion rates in Cu -sulfide minerals are relatively fast 
(Cherniak, 2010; Grguric and Putnis, 1999). Thus, mineral replacement driven by 
solid -state diffusion and by dissolution –preci pitation may, theoretically, proceed at 
similar  rates  in sulfide  minerals.  The identification  of the replacement  mechanism  must 
therefore rely on the analysis of reaction textures. The most important characteristics 
of the interface -coupled dissolution –precipitation mechanism (Putnis, 2009; Putnis 
and Putnis, 2007) include 1) a preservation of the parent -phase morphology and 
possible epitactic relations between the phases evidenced by transfer of 
crystallographic information from the parent, 2) a sharp and well-defined reaction 
front, 3) porosity and fractures in the product phase due to the relative solubilities  and 
molar volumes of parent and product that allow the advective transport of fluid to the 
reaction front, and element transport through the interc onnected fluid and 4) a 
dependence of the products on the chemical composition of the fluid at the reaction 
interface.  
Upon initial reaction, chalcocite releases Cu incongruently into solution, which is 
accompanied by the formation of digenite. Subsequentl y, digenite is replaced by 
covellite, which is consistent with previous observations (Cheng and Lawson, 1991; 
Hackl et al., 1995; Muszer et al., 2013; Parikh and Liddell, 1990). The replacement  of 
chalcocite by digenite requires a change in sulfur close -packing from hexagonal  (hcp) 
to cubic  (ccp)  and thus cannot  be reconciled  with Cu depletion  by solid -state diffusion. 
Consequently, we interpret digenite formation from chalcocite as fluid -mediated 
dissolution –precipitation reaction. Understanding the patchi ness of the replacement 
(the light - and dark -blue domains in Fig.5 -13b) is problematic but may indicate 
preferred  fluid -induced  reaction  along  close -packed  layers  in  the  chalcocite.  The 
 
 
180 Chapter 5  
 
 
texture formed when digenite is formed from bornite along fractures and along the 
grain boundary with chalcocite is consistent with a coupled dissolution –precipitation 
mechanism (Putnis, 2002; Putnis, 2009). The bornite –digenite reaction interface is 
sharp  also on the nm -scale (Fig. 5 -7) and Cu - and Fe -concentration profiles appear 
inconsistent with diffusion -dominated mass transport (Xia et al., 2009; Xia et al., 
2008). Furthermore, the absence of void space between the parent and product 
indicates that th e rate -determining step of the reaction is the dissolution rate of the 
parent  phase,  as has been  demonstrated  for chalcopyrite  (Zhao  et al., 2014).  Similarly, 
sharp replacement interfaces have also been observed in dissolution –precipitation 
experiments usi ng distinct starting materials (Janssen and Putnis, 2011; Niedermeier 
et al., 2009;  Perdikouri  et al., 2013;  Zhao  et al., 2014)  and Hellmann  et al. (2003)  found 
that a distinctive sharp chemical boundary between parent and product phases is 
incompatible wi th an interdiffusion proton and cation model. Within this framework, 
the formation of secondary phases, including the ultimate formation of covellite, and 
hence also the release of Cu (and other elements) into solution, is controlled by the 
relative solubi lities of primary and secondary sulfides and the fluid composition and 
saturation  state.  
In contrast to mineral replacement along fractures and at sample surfaces, the 
formation of the Cu -enriched and Cu -deficient bornite lamellae within coherent parts 
of the bornite (Fig. 5 -13c and d) cannot be reconciled with a  dissolution –precipitation 
reaction mechanism. Instead, similar exsolution textures have been linked to solid - 
state diffusion  in natural  samples  (Ciobanu  et al., 2017;  Hatert,  2003;  Schwartz,  1931; 
Schwartz, 1942) and were observed in annealing experiments at temperatures above 
100°C (Brett and Yund, 1964; Grguric et al., 2000; Grguric and Putnis, 1999; Zhao et 
al., 2017).  Fe and Cu diffusivities  in sulfide  minerals  are faster  than in silicate  minerals 
and can result in a noticeable compositional and textural modification of the original 
bornite at the timescales and temperatures of our experiments, given a sufficiently 
strong driving force. The absence of exsolution lamellae in dry ex periments on the 
same  bornite  reactant  thus suggests  that peripheral  fluid -mediated  mineral  replacement 
creates an adequate chemical potential gradient to initiate re -equilibration of the cuboid 
internal composition by solid -state diffusion, thus forming t he Cu -depleted bornite 
solid solution (X -Bn3 in Fig.5 -4). The probably thermodynamically unstable Cu-
depleted  bornite  solid  solution  exsolves  Cu- and Fe-depleted  lamellae,  resulting  in 
 
181 Chapter 5  
 
 
the basket -weave  texture  shown  in Figs.  5-9 and 5-10. Similar  observations  were  made 
by Zhao et al. (2017) and Li et al. (2018), who reported a several order -of-magnitude 
increase in the formation rate of sulfide exsolution textures in the presence of  reactive 
fluid.  
The exsolution found in our experiments depends on the alteration of the bornite 
composition,  which  in turn depends  on the fluid  composition.  This is demonstrated  by 
the absence  of exsolution  during  dry experiments  and at small  reaction  progress  (MSA 
experiments and during the initial stage of HCl experiments) when the fluid 
composition remained relatively unaffected by the  reactions.

5.4.2.  Preservation of fluid  pathways  
 
Continuous reaction requires fluid and mass transport through newly formed 
replacement rims to the reaction interface through reaction -induced interconnected 
porosity. Covellite formation from digenite and bornite was clearly accompanied by 
the formation  by µm-scale  pore space  that is visible  in optical  and BSE images,  similar 
to that found  in other  replacement  reactions  described  by this mechanism (Bowman  et 
al., 2007; Janssen and Putnis, 2011; Xia et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2013). This is 
consistent  with extensive  replacement  of the precursor  sulfide  phases  by covellite  with 
increasing reaction duration (e.g. Figs 5 -11b and 5 -12b). In contrast to covellite , the 
replacement of bornite by digenite proceeded without discernible porosity formation, 
implying a pore size beyond microscope resolution, i.e. nano -porosity. At this scale 
nanofluidic transport phenomena can be significant and effectively govern mass 
transport  (Plümper  et al., 2017;  Zheng  et al., 2018).  The difference  in porosity  between 
digenite and covellite is likely related to their difference in molar volume. The large 
molar volume of digenite (~130.7 cm3/mol) may counteract significant porosity 
formation during replacement of bornite (~24.6 cm3/mol), whereas isochemical 
replacement of digenite by covellite (~20.4 cm3/mol) would be accompanied by a 
strong volume reduction (volumes from densities and molar mass). However, none of 
the observed replace ment reactions proceed isochemically, thus complicating the 
quantification of mass transport and porosity  formation.  
Additional  porosity  may result  from  reaction -induced  fracturing,  which  in turn may be 
driven by the volume change of mineral replacement and saturation state of the 
interfacial fluid (Jamtveit et al., 2009). Secondary fractures that can be related to the 
formation  of digenite  were  observed  in a few places  (Fig.  5-12e and f). These  fractu res 
intersected the digenite –bornite reaction interface in regions where the bornite 
contained exsolution lamellae of Cu -deficient bornite. The fracture orientation 
generally followed the orientation of the exsolution lamellae and fracture rims in the 
bornite showed only thin or no secondary digenite, suggesting that fracture formation 
occurred relatively  late.

5.5. Implications for in-situ leaching operations  
 
In-situ leaching  operations  for copper  sulfides  have  been  avoided  due to the refractory 
behaviour  of the minerals  and the challengingly  low permeability  and porosity  of hard- 
rock ores. Successful implementation of ISR requires that Cu mineral surfaces  remain 
accessible. On a macroscopic scale, this can be achieved by me chanical operations 
such as blasting and hydrofractruring. However, on the grain scale, access requires a 
tailored approach and knowledge about how reactions create or clog pore space to 
avoid passivation.  
This research provides insight into the likely mec hanisms of chalcocite and bornite 
transformations under restricted oxidant conditions in acid environments. Initial 
replacements showed a slower development of porosity and fractures. Above a fluid 
Cu concentration of ~0.01 mol L₋1, the replacement of prec ursor sulfides by covellite 
facilitated the total replacement. This advance was only achieved by using stronger 
acid (pKa HCl = –5.9 and pKa MSA = –1.9) and extended reaction times. Based on 
our results,  we propose  that the use of acidic  pre-treatment  without oxidant  addition  to 
achieve mineral replacement may be a useful option for reducing oxidant 
requirements, enhancing permeability and optimising the copper dissolution rate for 
in-situ leaching. For mixed ores that contain copper oxides or initial covel lite, a mild 
acid solution may be suitable because the copper concentration could be increased by 
initial dissolution of the other phases. For refractory sulfides, the initial addition of a 
low concentration of copper sulfate may catalyse the  reaction.  
Porosity generation and fracturing provides the best opportunity for continuous 
interaction between the fluid and the mineral core, as evidenced by the increased 
replacement of the original phases. Experimental data suggest that for extended -time 
experimen ts, covellite would replace the original minerals and could have major 
repercussions for hydrometallurgical processing. Owing to its reactivity when 
compared  with the original  phases  and the textural  transformation  observed  in the final 
phase, the transformation of chalcopyrite or bornite into covellite by more 
economically viable pre -treatments represents an option for refractory copper sulfide 
processing.  
A total transformation  of primary  copper  sulfides  into covellite  as a pre-treatment  may 
enhance  the copper  dissolution  rate in otherwise  refractory  ores,  as was tested  in 
184 Chapter 5  
 
 
related experiments by Hidalgo et al. (2019b) (see Appendix B), which found that 
resulting covellite increased the copper dissolution rate when it is subsequently leached 
with an oxidant. For ISR operations, the textural transformation in our results is 
promising, and suggests a close relationship between fluid accessibility to the solid 
and the fluid chemistry. A better understanding of these interactions could optimize 
the lixiviant selection and complement mechanical accessibility -enhancement 
techniques.

Chapter 6. Effect of multistage solution –mineral contact for low - 
grade natural copper samples: extraction, acid consumption, 
gangue -mineral changes and precipitation  
 
 
This study  addresses  some  of the challenges  that may occur  during  the in-situ recovery 
of ores,  by understanding  the multistage  interaction  of lixiviant  with fresh  ore samples. 
Our experiments aimed to simulate what may occur when leach solution travels 
through targeted regions of an ore deposit from injection to recovery well. The leaching 
of a low -grade natural ore that contained refractory copper sulfides mixed with g angue 
minerals was studied by using iron(III) as an oxidant in sulfuric, hydrochloric  or 
methanesulfonic  acids  at 90°C.  The leach  solution  was contacted  over five successive 
stages with a new mass of ore every 72 h, without acid or oxidant replenishment.  The 
solutions  showed  a decreased  copper  extraction  capacity  after two contact stages but 
leaching continued for the entire experiment. After three contact stages, precipitates 
formed in all solutions; iron and calcium precipitates formed from the beginning of the 
second contact stage for all systems (akaganeite precipitated in the chloride systems 
and jarosite and gypsum formed in the sulfate systems) and the extent of precipitation 
increased with an increase in temperature and  pH. 
 
6.1. Introduction  
 
In-situ recovery (ISR) is an unconventional mining technique that requires the 
injection of a fluid (i.e., the lixiviant) in direct contact with subsurface ore to recover 
a valuable metal by the return of a pregnant solution to the surface fo r further 
processing. ISR may provide an alternative for processing low -grade reserves that are 
uneconomic to mine by conventional techniques. Besides being the primary global 
technique for the recovery of uranium (IAEA, 2016), ISR trials have been 
impleme nted mainly  for oxide  leaching,  for example,  at San Manuel,  Casa  Grande  and 
Santa Cruz (Seredkin et al., 2016). Deep reduced copper orebodies that contain 
refractory chalcopyrite or bornite are challenging to leach by ISR as they require 
oxidant addition, may require elevated temperatures and the copper minerals may be 
difficu lt to access . 
 
193 Chapter 6  
 
 
 
ISR requires continuous fluid –rock interaction prior to metal recovery from the fluid 
at the surface. Control limitations exist during processing because the interaction of 
the ore and fluid may occur over an extended distance between the injection and 
recovery wells (Mallio et al., 1981). The continuous transport of fluid between wells 
makes the maintenance of constant fluid conditions (such as pH and acid 
concentration) challenging, and soluble cation and ani on uptake results in changes in 
solution properties (such as pH and solution potential, Eh), as occurs in recycled 
solutions in heap leaching. Solution recycle with processing at the surface in heap 
leaching may be more flexible than in an ISR environment and allows for pH control, 
acid replenishment,  solid –liquid  separation  and washing  (Nikoloski  and Malley,  2018; 
Qian  et al., 2014).  Such  controls  may not be possible  in an ISR application  where  fluid 
(of a changing composition) interacts with fresh solid until the fluid reaches the 
recovery  point.  
 
Continuous fluid –rock interactions will be accompanied by value and gangue mineral 
dissolution, precipitation of new phases and ion -exchange reactions . Precipitation of 
secondary minerals in a saturated solution is one of the main geochemical processes 
that reduces hydraulic conductivity, specifically when the precipitate obstructs 
fractures,  reduces  the porosity  and thus impacts  copper  recovery  and acid consumption 
(Sinclair and Thompson, 2015). Precipitation is affected by temperature, leaching 
solution composition and ore mineralogy (Schmidt et al., 1992), where higher 
temperatures are expected in deeper ore bodies. The subsurface temperature may also  
have an important impact on the chemistry of the final solution and solids after fluid 
transport, as the stability of certain cation/anion combinations changes with 
temperature.  
 
To the best of our knowledge, only one study has investigated the recycling of 
lixiviants for ISR. Paulson (1992) conducted a series of laboratory experiments on 5 - 
cm-diameter and 20 -cm-long natural copper -oxide core samples with copper grades 
between 1.9 % and 7.7%. Sulfuric acid was injected into the cores with a recycling 
frequency between 1 and 4 weeks. After filtration, acid was added before the solution 
was contacted  with the solid  again.  Paulson  evaluated  the net effect  of the dissolution – 
precipitat ion reactions  and their effect  on final core permeability.  He found  that metals  
194 Chapter 6  
 
 
that were released from gangue minerals combined with sulfate from the lixiviant to 
form secondary mineral precipitates that significantly reduced the permeability.  
 
The reuse of solutions that contain oxidant, at elevated temperatures and without make -
up acid addition to simulate an ISR environment, has not been reported previously in 
the literature and is presented in this study. The aim was to characterize the fluid and 
solids after fluid –rock contact at estimated deep -ore-body temperatures (90°C)  using  
samples  that contained  low-grade  refractory  copper  and gangue  minerals.  
 
6.2. Experimental  
 
6.2.1.  Materials and  characterisation  
 
Samples of low -grade ore were ball milled, dry sieved and leached in acidic solutions 
containing ferric iron. Ferric iron was selected as the oxidant because it is affordable, 
soluble in a range of acid lixiviants and can be regenerated (Ferron, 2003). Fiv e 
solutions containing either ferric chloride or ferric sulfate were prepared with 
deionised water and methanesulfonic acid (MSA, with and without sodium chloride, 
NaCl), hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid (H 2SO 4) (see Table 6 -1) to represent 
sulfate  and chloride lixiviant systems. The solution concentrations were selected to 
achieve complete oxidation.

A particle size (P 80) of 68 µm (Brunauer –Emmett –Teller (BET) surface area of 3.2

195 Chapter 6  
 
 
placed in an ultrasonic bath for 20 min. The BET specific surface area analysis was 
performed by using a TriStar II automated gas adsorption analyser with nitrogen. 
Mineralogical identi fication was performed by using an E430 Pro Quantitative 
Evaluation of Minerals by Scanning Electron Microscopy (QEMSCAN). Samples 
were  mixed  with graphite  in a ratio of 1:3 to separate  the particles  and mounted  in resin 
using a protocol described by Meyer  et al. (2013). The final data were processed with 
Idiscover 5.2 software. X -ray powder diffraction (XRD) data were collected in a 
PANalytical Empyrean X -ray diffractometer equipped with a Bragg -Brentano HD 
incident monochromator. The working parameters we re: an incident beam at 0.5ᵒ, a 
divergence slit at 40 kV, 40 mA and 0.02 rad Soller slits and a 1ᵒ antiscatter slit with a 
diffracted beam pixel three dimensions (3D) array detector in scanning one dimension 
(1D) mode with a 0.125° antiscatter slit and 0.0 2 rad soller slits. Morphological and 
compositional analyses were performed by scanning electron microscopy -energy 
dispersive spectroscopy (SEM -EDS, JEOL -JSM-7001) with a 10 mm SDD detector 
and a resolution of 125 eV, 20 kV and a 10 mm working distance. Al l analyses and 
experiments were conducted at CSIRO Mineral Resources,  Perth . 
 
6.2.2. Contact test methods  
 
Leach tests were performed in a shaking water bath at 90°C using sealed 250 mL 
Nalgene bottles, with a constant pulp density of 10% m/v. Each experiment consisted 
of five 72 -h stages (total of 360 h). The duration of each stage (72 h) was selected in 
prior  screening experiments, as this allowed for the maximum copper extraction to be 
reached  using  fresh  lixiviant,  and five stages  were  required  to achieve  changes  in solid 
and fluid behaviour. The schematic in Fig. 6 -1 shows how stages 1 to 5 aimed to 
represe nt a period during which target ore contacts pumped fluid in an ISR scenario 
until the recovery  point  is reached.  After  72 h, the fluid  was filtered,  sub-sampled,  and 
the remaining solution was contacted immediately with fresh solid at a 10% w/v pulp 
densi ty. The solid residues were washed twice with distilled water and dried in a 
Binder BD56 standard incubator at 30°C. Triplicate experiments yielded an error of 
below 2%. Selected solids were digested with aqua regia after experiments for mass 
balance purpo ses and secondary element dissolution calculations (Na, Ca, K, Mg, Al 
and S). Fluid analysis was by inductively coupled plasma optical emission 
spectrometry (ICP -OES). pH and Eh values were obtained by using Ionode ORP  and

pH (IJ44A  and IJ64)  combination  electrodes.  The dissolution  per stage  was calculated 
based on final solution analysis and from the elemental analysis of the fresh solid  that 
was added at the beginning of the  stage.

6.3. Results and  discussion  
 
6.3.1.  Initial sample  characterisation  
 
Characterisation of the starting material by QEMSCAN inferred that the solids 
contained mainly feldspars, micas, clays and iron oxi des. Chalcopyrite and chalcocite 
represented the main copper minerals, whereas bornite and covellite occurred in trace 
amounts (Table 6 -2).

The XRD  pattern  of the original  sample  indicated  that albite  was the major  phase  with 
additional peaks of actinolite (amphibole), quartz and orthoclase (Fig. 6 -2). Traces of 
calcite, chalcopyrite and muscovite were also found, which is consistent with the 
concentrations  of calcium,  sulfur  and magnesium  from  the elemental  analysis  in Table

SEM analysis of the sample showed that copper sulfides were surrounded by gangue 
minerals  (Fig.  6-3). Calcium  was contained  mainly  in calcite.  The Ca/Mg  overlap  may 
imply the existence of amphibole, as was confirmed by the XRD data. The iron and 
copper map s did not overlap completely because of the existence of magnetite in the 
sample.  Sulfur  overlapped  with copper,  which  indicated  the presence  of copper  sulfide 
minerals and Fe/S overlap confirmed the presence of  pyrite.

6.3.2.  Fluid analysis  
 
The solution  Eh decreased  on average  by ~110  mV between  stages  1 and 5 (Fig.  6-4a). 
The pH increased  over the five stages  but remained  below  2 (Fig.  6-4b). The variation 
in pH between solutions is thought to reflect variations in the proportions of acid - 
consuming  minerals  (e.g.,  carbonates)  and acid-producing  minerals  (e.g.,  jarosite).  The 
maximum  acid consumption  between  stages  1 and 3 was 57 kg sulfuric  acid t-1 ore, 49 
kg MSA t-1 ore with ferric sulfate addition, 36 kg HCl t-1 ore and 44 kg MSA t-1 ore 
with ferric chloride addition. The acid consumptions in the ferric -sulfate systems 
exceeded those for copper -oxide heap leaching with sulfuric acid of 18 –47 kg t-1 
(Azmayandeh et al., 2017). Based on the initial concentration of carbon (TIC), an 
average of 30 kg t-1 of acid would be consumed by carbonates if all were accessible, 
therefore most of the acid was expected to be consumed by the  carbonates.

Fig. 6 -4. a. Redox potential and b. pH change after five contact stages with fresh solid.  
 
Copper in the pregnant leach solution originated primarily from chalcopyrite 
dissolution. Copper recovery increased during the first two stages for all solutions 
used. Figure 6 -5a presents the copper leached per stage for each of the five solutions 
after contact  with fresh  solid  sample  in each stage.  The peak  copper  recovery  occurred 
in stage 2 and was highest in the ferric -chloride solutio ns with HCl and MSA (70% 
and 72%, respectively) compared with the ferric -sulfate solutions with MSA, 
MSA/NaCl and H 2SO 4 (54%, 38% and 41%, respectively). Copper dissolution in 
subsequent  stages  decreased.  No copper  dissolved  after stage  3 in the Fe2(SO 4)3/H2SO 4 
solution. After stage 4, copper dissolved only in the FeCl 3/MSA and FeCl 3/HCl 
solutions. Iron dissolution was determined from the dissolved iron in solution minus 
the initial concentration of ferric iron from the oxidant (Fig. 6 -5b). Negative values  in 
Fig. 6-5b indicate  that iron precipitated  from  solution.  Iron dissolved  in stages  1 and 2 
(up to 96% iron dissolved in the FeCl 3/HCl system, Fig. 6 -5b). Thereafter, iron 
precipitated  in all systems,  with up to 27% of the initial  iron in the sample  precipitating 
in the Fe 2(SO 4)3/MSA/NaCl  system.

Fig. 6-5. a. Copper  and b. iron extraction  during  the five experimental  stages  (72 h each stage) 
(no iron dissolution occurred after stage  2). 
 
Figure  6-6 presents  the dissolution  of sulfur,  calcium,  aluminium,  sodium,  magnesium 
and potassium for selected stages (these elements were chosen based on experimental 
design and sample volume availabi lity for analysis). Calcium dissolution occurred in 
all stages in the ferric -chloride systems (FeCl 3/HCl and FeCl 3/MSA) but precipitated 
in the ferric -sulfate systems (Fe 2(SO 4)3/H2SO 4, Fe 2(SO 4)3/MSA/NaCl and 
Fe2(SO 4)3/MSA). The maximum aluminium and magnes ium yields were low (< 20% 
and 55%, respectively) compared with these of the other metals, which may confirm 
that the calcium in solution originated mainly from calcite and only a small fraction 
was derived  from  amphiboles.  Sodium  and potassium  dissolution  decreased  after stage 
2 and precipitates formed in the final stages, because their solubility levels in the 
presence of both iron and sulfate were reached; this is discussed further below. High 
levels of dissolved impurities (K+, Na+, Ca2+, Al3+ and Mg2+) may increase 
precipitation and may also affect the rate of chalcopyrite dissolution. In our 
experiments, MSA and HCl solutions produced a higher solubility of heavy metals 
(e.g., Fe, Cu, Ni, Zn) than sulfuric acid, which may be disadvantageous in  a multi - 
contact  scenario.

To establish the theoretical effect of temperature and continuous leaching on element 
precipitation, stability diagrams for copper, iron and calcium and for all leaching 
systems were prepared using the Geochemist’s Workbench® (GWB) software 
package. These diagrams allow for an understanding of the behaviour of the systems 
during the leaching stages. For example, the stability diagrams for copper, iron and 
calcium for the Fe 2(SO 4)3/H2SO 4 solution for stages 2 and 4 are shown in Fig. 6 -7. 
Although copper is p redicted to be soluble as Cu2+ for a pH below 4 and an Eh above  
0.42 V (Fig. 6 -7a and b) in stages 1 and 4, no additional copper dissolution occurred  
in the Fe 2(SO 4)3/MSA/NaCl and Fe 2(SO 4)3/H2SO 4 systems in stage 4. The reduction  in 
dissolution may result from surface passivation. The iron stability range decreased in  
stage  4; K-jarosite  precipitation  (Fig.  6-7c and d) was predicted  above  pH 1 in stage 1 
and above pH 0.6 in stage 4. Calcium was sol uble under stage -2 conditions (soluble 
calcium sulfate), but the calcium solubility limit was reached in stage 4 and gypsum 
precipitation was predicted (Fig. 6 -7e and  f).

Figure 6 -8 compares the change in mineral/precipitate mass percentage as the 
difference between the initial sample mineral masses and the precipitate masses in 
stages  1 and 4. Gypsum  precipitated  in the sulfate  solutions  (Fig.  6-8a) with maximum 
precipitat ion occurring in the Fe 2(SO 4)3/H2SO 4/NaCl solutions. Additional sodium in 
the initial  solutions  appeared  to promote  gypsum  formation  because  of cation  build  up.

Calcium remained dissolved in the chloride solutions (Fig. 6 -8b). A greater mass 
percentage of jarosite precipitated in the sulfate solutions (Fig. 6 -8a) compared with 
the akaganeite  in chloride  solutions  (Fig.  6-8b). These  data may confirm  that more  iron 
precipitated in the sulfate solutions compared with the chloride  solutions.

6.3.3.2.  Chloride  systems  
 
 
Yellow solid residues formed in the chloride leaching systems (FeCl 3/HCl and 
FeCl 3/MSA). XRD indicated that akageneite (β -Fe3+O(OH,Cl)), which is a chloride - 
containing ferric oxyhydroxide, formed in the ferric -chloride solutions (and more 
rapidly in HCl t han in MSA solution, Fig. 6 -9). Akaganeite occurs commonly in high 
chloride environments, as a corrosion product of iron materials and as a precipitate in 
inland acidic soils (Bibi et al., 2011; Jenssen et al., 2018). Its precipitation via iron 
hydrolysis requires the presence of Cl- (> 0.1 M) and a low pH (< 3) (Peretyazhko et 
al., 2018).  
𝐹𝑒𝐶𝑙 3  + 𝐻2𝑂 →   𝐹𝑒(𝑂𝐻)3−𝑥𝐶𝑙𝑥  + (3  − 𝑥)𝐻𝐶𝑙 (1) 
 
Because of the fine grain size of akageneite (< 1 µm), a determination of the exact 
chemical composition was not possible. However, analysis of akaganeite particle 
agglomerates yielded an average chemical composition of 34.5% O, 59.4% Fe and 
6.1%  Cl, which  agrees  with the characterisation  by Bibi et al. (2011).  Most  akageneite 
precipitates occurred as nanosized dispersed flakes and did not form thick  superficial

layers.  Others  existed  as thin rod-shaped  layers  attached  to silicates  after the first stage 
(Fig.  6-10a).

6.3.3.3.  Sulfate  systems  
 
 
Residues from the sulfate leaching solutions (Fe 2(SO 4)3/H2SO 4 and Fe 2(SO 4)3/MSA) 
were  yellow.  Abundant  small  rounded  platy  crystals  of  potassium   jarosite  (KFe 
(SO 4)2(OH) 6, 45.2% O, 13.7% S, 5.3% K and 35.6% Fe, Fig. 6 -10b) and a  thick  
surface layer of rhombohedral Na -jarosite (NaFe(SO 4)2(OH) 6, 47.3% O, 4.9% Na, 
12.9%S and 34.8% Fe, Fig. 6 -10c) were identified from the XRD and SEM images. 
The jarosite morphology agrees with  that found in the literature (Cogram, 2018). 
Differences in jarosite morphology may be related to the formation rate and type of 
monovalent cations present (Sasaki and Konno, 2000). Jarosite, which precipitates by 
monovalent cation incorporation into the jarosite structure, results in acid formation 
(Equation  2) and occurs  at ferric  ion concentrations  between  0.025 –3 M in the presence 
of alkali  metals,  such  as  Na and  K  (Dutrizac,  1982),  and  between  pH  0.9 and 2  
207 
4 Chapter 6  
 
 
(Córdoba  et al., 2009;  Lu et al., 2000).  The initial  iron plus the excess  of iron dissolved 
during the first stages and alkali -metal dissolution from gangue facilitated jarosite 
precipitation when the pH exceeded 0.7. The decrease in dissolved iron, sodium and 
potassium after the first stage supports the observation of Na -jarosite and K -jarosite 
formation.

Nanometre -sized  colloidal  silica  precipitated  and agglomerated  on the surface  of other 
minerals (also present in chloride systems) (Fig. 6 -10d). All sulfate solutions showed 
gypsum precipitation after stage 2 in the form of large needles with an average 
composition  of 56.6%  O, 18% S and 25.3%  Ca (Fig.  6-10e).  Carbonate  was confirmed, 
given the low dissolution of Mg (and in particular from amphibole), to be the main 
source of calcium. Carbonate dissolution consumes acid and can lead to gypsum 
precipitation  at sufficiently  high calcium  and sulfate  concentrations  (Gomis -Yagües  et 
al., 2000) (Equation  3).

Such precipitation can result in flow rate reduction, as illustrated at the Twin Buttes 
heap -leaching operations and in ISR operations, such as the Cyprus Casa Grande 
operat ion (Bartlett, 1998; Earley and Jones, 1992).

6.3.3.4.  Sulfate systems with added  NaCl  
 
 
The highest percentage of iron and calcium precipitation occurred in the 
Fe2(SO 4)3/H2SO 4/NaCl system after stage 2. Akaganeite did not form, possibly 
because of the higher concentration of SO 42- over Cl- in solution. Rather, a layer of  K- 
jarosite and Na -jarosite intergrowth remained after rinsing the precipitate (Fig. 6 -11). 
Figure 6 -12 compares the XRD pattern for the initial sample, with these of products 
that formed after stages 3 and 5 with ferric sulfate and sodium chloride in MSA 
solution. Major phas es, such as albite and quartz, were still present in the sample, 
whereas calcite appeared to have dissolved completely. This type of precipitation 
occurs when copper dissolution stops, and, therefore, it is thought that agglomerates 
that coat the copper su lfide may inhibit copper  dissolution.

6.3.3.5.  Residue  morphology  
 
 
Leaching  can result  in particle -surface  modification,  sometimes  without  large  changes 
in mass, which can increase the particle wettability and porosity (Suzany Ferreira dos 
Santos et al., 2019). Changes in particle -surface texture and increases in particle 
porosity have been observed previously for sulfide leaching (Hidalgo et al., 2019b). 
As an indicator of the development of particle “porosity”, a measure of rugosity was 
applied, which is an indirect measure of the particle “non -sphericity” or roughness. 
The rugosity is the ratio between the intrinsic area (including the cracks and /or pores, 
as determined  by BET)  and the characteristic  area,  which  is the surface  that is projected 
as a plane (as a spherical particle, as determined by dynamic light scattering 
measurements or specific surface area (SSA)) (Du Preez, 2015). A higher rati o 
indicates a higher porosity or the presence of surface  irregularities.  
Figure 6 -14 compares the particle size, surface area and rugosity. The particle size 
(P80) decreased  after five stages  for all solutions,  with the ferric  sulfate  in sulfuric  acid 
yielding the smallest particle size. The surface area and rugosity both increased. 
Samples  that were  reacted  with the chloride  solutions  (FeCl 3/MSA  and FeCl 3/HCl)

had a rugosity that was five times larger than that of the original sample, possibly 
because of the reduced particle size after leaching and dispersed distribution of 
precipitates (e.g., micron -sized akaganeite flakes) that formed only in the chloride 
solutions.

• Solids analyses (XRD, SEM/EDS and QEMSCAN) showed three major 
precipitation phases, namely, jarosite and gypsum in the sulfate system and 
akaganeite in the chloride system. Precipitation occurred because of the 
increased  cation  concentrations  in solution  (Na+, Ca2+and K+), the experimental 
temperature, and pH increase after stage  2. 
 
• Less precipitation of iron occurred from the chloride solutions (FeCl 3/MSA and 
FeCl 3/HCl) than the sulfate solutions (Fe 2(SO 4)3/MSA, Fe 2(SO 4)3/H2SO 4 and 
Fe2(SO 4)3/MSA/NaCl). Li kewise, the presence of MSA reduced  iron

hydrolysis and delayed precipitate formation compared with the sulfuric and 
hydrochloric acid systems.  
 
• SEM imaging showed that precipitates in sulfate solutions formed 
agglomerates, and those in chloride solutions formed small particles, both of 
which  can block  microfractures.  These  precipitates  formed  after three  stages  of 
contact for the conditions used in this  study.  
 
• NaCl addition increased the precipitation from sulfate solutions and promoted 
the formation of gypsum and  Na-jarosite.  
 
• Increased initial  ferric concentration promoted increased precipitation, 
especially when sulfate and alkali were  present.  
 
• Iron precipitates formed passivation layers and may hinder copper  dissolution.  
 
Because tests were conducted on finely ground material in this study, 
recommendations for future work include studies on changes in permeability (as a 
result of solid changes, such as precipitate formation) in wide horizontal columns  that 
contain fractured  material or cores above 60°C, with fluid monitoring at intermediate 
points along the column, to enable a closer approximation to a real ISR  environment.  
 
The most important implication for ISR from this study was the demonstration that 
precipitates will form as the lixiviant moves from the injection to the collection well. 
Precipitates may block narrow flow paths. As these precipitates are in chemical 
equil ibrium with the pregnant solution, they are unlikely to redissolve during 
continued fluid flow and they may form preferential pathways, result in “short 
circuiting” (Sinclair and Thompson, 2015) or cause equipment failure (Zhang et al., 
2017). Based on our  results and information in the literature, recommendations for 
precipitation control in ISR processing include:  
 
• MSA and hydrochloric acid use may be preferred to sulfuric acid use for ores 
with high alkali -metal  contents.  
 
 
213 Chapter 6  
 
 
• Addition of NaCl is not recommended when the solid contains high amounts 
of sodium -rich minerals and sulfate is present in solution, and/or in the 
presence of soluble iron minerals.  
 
• Copper dissolution is related closely to iron precipitation; ideally, co nstant  pH 
control is required and, between 40°C and 90°C, the pH should be below  1.8. 
 
• Surfactant addition may prevent microfracture clogging and/or cationic 
polymer and clay swelling (Tan et al., 2014), but may be  costly.  
 
• Rinsing stages can dilute cation build up and dissolve soluble precipitates but 
would also incur additional operational  costs.  
 
• Well  spacing  will be a trade -off between  close  spacing  to prevent  precipitation 
and more cost -effective wider spacing. Furthermore, increased well spacing 
may not be counterbalanced by the use of higher oxidant concentrations 
(Bartlett,  1998).

Chapter 7. Conclusions and recommendations for ISR application  
 
 
This research serves as a component of work being undertaken to unlock the  potential 
for hard -rock in situ recovery  (ISR). Experiments focused on an analysis of fluids and 
solids  that had been leached under simulated ISR conditions. Analytical techniques 
were used for solids characterisation and allowed for the identification of 
morphologies, chemistry and textures of the reacted solids. Conclusions were made 
based on the gaps in knowledge provided in Chapter 1 and are presented with 
recommendations for ISR implementation.  
 
 
• Mineral  dissolution  and fluid  stability:  Under  similar  conditions,  the various 
leaching fluids showed different copper leaching efficiencies, with chloride 
solutions showing the best performance for chalcopyrite dissolution above 
60°C. At 90°C, other fluids that proved promising at lower temperatures were 
affected detrimentally (e.g., potassium dichromate). The accessibility was 
enhanced by certain fluids (e.g.,  ferric and copper chloride) and increased the 
number of fractures, the surface area and the porosity. When the fluid was 
negatively affected by changes in pH and acid consumption, this accessibility 
enhancement was compromised, and undesired precipitation  reduced the solid 
permeability and copper dissolution rates. High -temperature experiments 
allowed for a comparison with low -temperature experiments and filled 
knowledge  gaps.  Tests  to simulate  low-oxygen  environments  that are expected  
in deep ore bodies showed copper dissolution in several solutions (FeCl 3 and 
K2Cr2O7 in HCl). Therefore, ISR could be possible at high temperature even 
with a low oxygen solubility. Based on different selection criteria, FeCl 3+HCl  
was found to be the most  efficient solution for chalcopyrite dissolution in the 
presence of pyrite above 90°C. High -temperature (170˚C) experiments were 
presented at the ALTA conference and the associated paper is attached as 
Appendix  A.

• Reaction kinetics and mechanism: An understanding of the kinetics of 
composite samples is important for ISR because of the lack of selectivity in 
real operation. Activation energies were determined from kinetic studies of 
composite samples. Th e energy requirements changed when more than one 
phase was present. In these cases, empirical equations may not fit the 
experimental data, and an alternative method for energy calculation should be 
applied, such as the ‘time -to-a-given -fraction’ methodolog y. This method can 
be used to calculate the energy requirements for different reaction stages and 
composite samples with a high concentration of gangue and valuable mineral 
sources,  which  makes  it a valuable  tool for ISR leaching  characterisation.  Some 
product formation showed characteristic features of interface coupled 
dissolution –reprecipitation (ICDR), including a sharp chemical interface and 
porosity development in the newly -formed phases (Pollok et al., 2011; Putnis, 
2002; Putnis, 2009; Putnis , 2015; Ruiz -Agudo et al., 2012; Ruiz -Agudo et al., 
2014; Xia et al., 2009). At ISR temperatures, the coexistence of ICDR and 
solid -state diffusion  was found;  the specific  characteristics  of each mechanism 
have important implications on the resulting produ ct textures and may affect 
the microscale permeability of the  ores.  
 
• Compositional and morphological transformations: The product layers 
were influenced by the local fluid chemistry and changed over the course of 
the reaction. Furthermore, under similar co nditions and using the same 
solution, different product layers were found among copper sulfides 
(chalcopyrite,  bornite  and chalcocite).  Sulfur  was the main  product  that formed 
during leaching, as was also presented by Dutrizac (1990). The texture of the 
sulfur layers  depends  on the fluid  chemistry  and on the leached  mineral.  Sulfur 
porosity changed in the presence of chloride when chalcopyrite was leached 
and evolved  with reaction  time by healing  the porosity  as shown  by the bornite 
solids. Copper -enrichment phases resulted from chalcopyrite oxidation and 
were produced mainly when copper was concentrated in fluids. The copper - 
enrichment phases showed no passivation; these phases also formed with 
depleted oxidant and with acid  only present in the fluid and leached more 
rapidly  with oxidant  addition  after the initial  transformation  (Appendix  B). The 
 
220 Chapter 7  
 
 
transformations followed the reactive zones and transformed the entire mineral, 
and in some cases the surrounding gangue minerals and  impermeable zones. 
Fractures triggered the initial transformation and retained the effective 
permeability and porosity through contact with the ore. Passivation resulted 
when iron precipitates formed during multistage fluid –rock interactions in 
sulfate sol utions because of the formation of jarosite that coated the 
chalcopyrite  surface.  
 
• Low -grade ore dissolution and the effect of gangue minerals : When a 
higher content of gangue was initially present and there was continuous  fluid – 
rock interaction above 90° C, an increase in precipitations was evidenced. 
Precipitation resulted from the increase in concentration of anions and cations 
in solution even with a slight increase of pH. The increase in cation and anion 
concentrations in fluids caused iron hydrolysis,  especially in sulfate solutions. 
The use of such solutions in the presence of gangue may induce fracture 
blockage and passivation of the reactive surfaces. Even though an increase of 
acidity and continuous pumping could counteract some of these effects, 
prolonged fluid –rock contact will accelerate acid consumption along the flow 
pathway. Thus, careful oxidant selection to minimise these adverse effects is 
vital.  
The outcomes of this research highlight the importance of geometallurgical analysis 
for ISR ope rations. The analysis of fluid and rock behaviour is a valuable tool for initial 
fluid selection to avoid issues associated with reactions and solid transformations. The 
main conclusion from this research is that solid transformations are dynamic and are 
related closely to fluid chemistry.  
 
 
Based on these results, recommendations for ISR operations include:  
 
• Optimal fluid selection: Fluid selection should be based on copper 
dissolution, stability at a chosen temperature, passivation behaviour, 
environmenta l impact, accessibility enhancement and cost. Some fluids prove 
promising when assessed according to many of these points (e.g., ferric 
chloride, sodium nitrate and copper chloride). Although ferric sulfate  solution  
221 Chapter 7  
 
 
tends to be the preferred industry choice, this solution shows a low copper 
dissolution, passivation behaviour and temperature instability. The cost savings  
that are possible  in ISR operations  compared  with conventional  mining 
(Seredkin et al., 2016) may a llow for a more expensive fluid  selection.  
 
• Use of pre -treatments or mixed systems: The use of mild hydrothermal 
solutions (e.g., low -concentration Cu2+ solutions or acidic solutions) results in 
enriched  copper  phases  (Cai et al., 2011;  Cerda  et al., 2017;  Zhao  et al., 2014). 
This resulting phase may be soluble because the textural and morphological 
transformation increases the reactivity of the ore compared with the unreacted 
ore. Subject to time constraints, pre -treatment with affordable acidic 
hydro thermal solutions could be used to replicate natural transformations 
(geomimetics) followed by aggressive oxidation to increase the copper 
recovery rate and ore accessibility. Chalcopyrite transformed to copper - 
enriched  phases  in acidic  solutions  when  fractures  were  present.  Therefore,  the 
simultaneous application of blasting with pre -treatment or staged dissolution 
may allow for an increased chalcopyrite replacement  rate. 
 
• Composite solid kinetics: In the case of composite solids with more than one 
source  of valuable metal, kinetics were most affected by the dominant phase. 
The energy requirements (activation energies) changed during the reaction. 
The best approach for kinetic analysis is to use the ‘time -to-a-given -fraction’ 
method, which can be applied t o ISR complex  ores.  
 
• Reaction -driven accessibility enhancement: Optimal leaching behaviours 
depend to a large extent on ensuring fluid –rock contact. Textural 
transformations occurred after all reactions, with the reaction -driven 
enhancement of initial frac tures and the enhancement of fluid –rock contact 
being of significance. Aggressive solutions provided major fracture networks 
that enhanced the fluid pathways. Mechanical accessibility enhancement is 
mandatory for chalcopyrite leaching below 90°C. Fluid sel ection could assist 
microscale accessibility, generate effective porosity and increase the overall 
permeability.  
 
 
222 Chapter 7  
 
 
• Oxidant/lixiviant influence in precipitations: Within the ranges tested, 
oxidant and acid concentrations did not significantly influenced the 
chalcopyrite and bornite dissolution kinetics. Higher oxidant concentrations 
were counterproductive for some solutions and increased precipitations 
resulted when  pH and acid concentrations were not maintained. The use of 
saline or hypersaline water may increase cation and anion concentrations, 
which could cause jarosite/akaganeite/gypsum precipitation, especially at 
higher temperatures, which, in turn, could produ ce major blockages in hard - 
rock fracture  channels,  scale  and corrosion  in pipes.  An increase  in salinity  and 
continuous  contact  with fresh  solid  resulted  in an increase  in acid consumption. 
Therefore, oxidant concentrations should be based on the initial copper 
concentration in the solid with limited excess. The use of saline water is not 
recommended  when  high concentrations  of cation -containing  gangue  is present 
in the ore, especially when ferric sulfate in sulfuric acid is used as the leach 
solution. The monitoring of fluid changes by continuous sampling and, if 
possible, by real -time analysis of groundwater (such as by using new 
techniques, such as Sense i® sensors (Caruso et al., 2018)) could prevent 
precipitation, which could have important repercussions for hard -rock 
permeability.  
 
 
This work provides a starting point in terms of the understanding of fluid –rock 
interactions under ISR conditions. In future, the geological identification of candidate 
samples for ISR processing and fluid selection should be applied to Australian  copper 
ores. Similar studies could also be expanded to other commodities, such as nickel or 
gold. Differences were visible between  fine-grained and cuboid samples. Work could 
be expanded to understand copper -sulfide leaching of cores, and hard -rock kinetic 
analysis could be conducted to understand the effect of a reduced surface area. 
Experimental apparatus may include column leachin g and flow -through reactors. The 
extent  of accessibility  enhancement  on copper  dissolution  by selected  lixiviants  should 
be compared with that of blasted solids, such as those that may be expected to be 
produced for in -mine recovery (IMR) (Mousavi and Sell ers, 2019) and hard -rock ISR 
applications.

Appendix A. Comparative analysis of lixiviant/oxidant systems for 
chalcopyrite leaching from coarse samples at elevated temperature  
 
 
Chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) is the most common copper -bearing mineral and represents 
more than half of global copper mineral reserves (Wang, 2005). Refractory 
chalcopyrite  requires  the addition  of an oxidant  and lixiviant  for dissolution.  Although 
lixiviants have been evaluated in previous studies for conventional mining, limited 
information is available regarding their behaviour during the leaching of coarse 
samples at high temperatures, including their stabilities and what secondary produ cts 
may form.  We compared  the thermal  stability  of a variety  of lixiviants  and their ability 
to leach copper from chalcopyrite with oxidant addition at set temperature, pressure 
and pH conditions. Tests were conducted at 170°C for 120 to 576 hours using so lid 
cubes (4 -mm sides) to simulate coarse samples found in heap leaching and in -situ 
recovery. Sealed batch reactors (closed -system conditions) were used to simulate an 
anaerobic environment that may be experienced in a subterranean application (such 
as an  in-situ recovery environment). Lixiviants, including sulfuric acid, hydrochloric 
acid and glycine,  and oxidants,  including  iron(III),  copper,  dichromate,  permanganate 
and hydrogen  peroxide,  were  screened  for their suitability  to leach  copper  from  hard– 
rock copper -sulfide  deposits.  
This paper presents the findings from this study and includes a comparison of the 
leaching systems at high temperature based on an identification of products and 
passivation phenomena, and an analysis of surficial textures. Conc lusions are 
provided  on the possible  suitability  of the systems  for use in high-temperature  copper 
in-situ recovery processing based on the laboratory performance of the chosen 
systems.  
 
A.1. Introduction  
 
During the hydrometallurgical processing of copper -sulfide minerals, an oxidant such 
as Fe3+ or O 2 is used to oxidize sulfide to sulfate and r elease copper into solution for 
recovery and purification (Schlesinger et al., 2011). The selection of a suitable 
lixiviant/oxidant   system   can   enhance   the   recovery   rate,   reduce   the  lixiviant  
 
226 Appendix A  
 
 
consumption and result in an overall increase in mining efficiency. Chalcopyrite 
leaching studies have attracted significant interest because of the global abundance of 
this mineral and its high copper content. A variety of oxidant/lixiviant combinations 
for the processing of reduced copper minerals under ambient conditions have been 
examined (Acero et al., 2007; Antonijević et al., 1994; Bonan, 1981; Córdoba et al., 
2008; Eksteen, 2017; Li, 2010; Ruiz, 2011; Watling, 2013; Watling, 2014) and the 
outcomes f rom these studies highlight important aspects of primary -sulfide leaching 
at low - to medium -temperature conditions. Conventional systems include mainly  Fe3+ 
as an oxidant. When leaching with Fe3+, chalcopyrite is sensitive to temperature 
changes  and its solubility  increases  with increasing  pressure  and temperature  (Córdoba 
et al., 2008; Dutrizac, 1981; Munoz et al., 1979; Watling). Other authors studied the 
effect of copper as an oxidant and identified that Cl- accelerates the leaching rate 
(Skrobian et a l., 2005). Some alternative oxidant and lixiviant systems have been tested 
under low -temperature conditions using concentrated chalcopyrite, and these include 
ammonia, dichromate and glycine. These tests have shown promising results, e.g., 
potassium dichro mate showed 80% copper extraction after 150 min at 90°C 
(Antonijević et al., 1994; Aydogan et al., 2006; Beckstead and Miller, 1977; Oraby 
and Eksteen, 2015). An understanding of the lixiviant/oxidant response beyond these 
known temperature (and pressure) regimes may be required in an in -situ recovery 
(ISR)  environment.  However,  limited  studies  exist  on different  commercially  proposed 
systems  above  225°C  (Ferron  et al., 2000;  McDonald  and Muir,  2007;  Yu et al., 1973).  
 
The formation of surface layers, which  is commonly termed “passivation”, has an 
important  influence  on the leaching  rate. In some  cases,  passivation  layers  may restrict 
lixiviant  access  to the reaction  interface.  However,  surface  layers  that may form  during 
the oxidation process, such as less refractory secondary copper -enrichment phases, 
may favour mineral dissolution (Li et al., 2010). Diverse types of product layers may 
form in different systems and/or under different conditions, which implies that more 
than one secondary phase can form during the same leaching process. A better 
understanding of the mechanisms of secondary -phase formation during leaching and 
its influence on the leaching rate will highlight optimal dissolution conditions. 
Therefore, an understanding of the matrix response to lixiviant/oxidant systems at the 
grain -scale is  essential to evaluate possible operational  issues,  e.g., the potential  for 
 
 
227 Appendix A  
 
 
pore-space  clogging,  which  may induce  blockage  of the lixiviant  flow path and prevent 
recovery from the pregnant leach  solution.  
In this paper, we discuss the leaching behavior of coarse pieces of a natural 
chalcopyrite sample in six different lixiviant/oxidant systems under similar 
conditions, using commercially available oxidants and lixiviants and its possible 
extrapolation to a practical operation.  
 
 
A.2. Experimental conditions 
Initial sample  
Natural samples of chalcopyrite from a private collection without a specified origin 
were  cut and polished  to form  ~4 mm  4 mm  4 mm cubes  (~64 mm3 volume).  Initial 
samples were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The experimental 
average point chemical distribution in the blank cubes was measured to obtain an 
indication of their elemental abundance before leaching. These values served as a 
baselin e for secondary -product identification. Surface X -ray diffraction (XRD) 
analysis and aqua –regia digestion with inductively coupled plasma –atomic emission 
spectroscopy  (ICP –AES)  were  used to determine  the sample  mineralogy  and chemical 
composition,  respecti vely.  
Leaching tests  
 
Triplicate experiments were conducted using cubes with the lixiviant/oxidant  systems 
listed  in Table  A-1. The cubes  were  covered  with 5 ml of solution  and sealed  in in 10- 
ml Teflon -lined closed stainless -steel batch reactors. The reactors were heated to a  set 
temperature in standard convection ovens at 170°C. Screening experiments were 
conducted at elevated temperature to accelerate the reaction with the coarse sample, 
identify the viability of the lixiviant/oxidant system and compare the effectiveness of 
the different lixiviants and oxidants under the same conditions. To simulate extreme 
conditions  for deep  ore bodies  (relevant  for ISR),  no oxidant  or oxygen  replenishme nt 
occurred during the experiments. The experimental set up did not allow for pH or Eh 
monitoring or control during the experiment. The leaching time varied from one to 
three  weeks,  after which  solids  and fluids  were  sampled.  The leachates  were  filtered  
228 Appendix A  
 
 
and diluted, the solid residues were washed and dry -mounted in epoxy resin and 
polished to obtain a cross section of the sample surface below and surface product.  
 
The oxidant concentrations were calculated from the  stoichiometric dissolution 
relationships with chalcopyrite (see Table A -1) and a factor of twice excess oxidant 
was added to the solution. Reagents were from BASF, Sigma Aldrich and Ajax 
Finechem.  Most  systems  were  stable  under  the temperature  conditions  that were  tested; 
no precipitation or density changes resulted during the experiment, but the glycine 
decomposed above 60°C below pH  12.

Characterisation  
 
Reaction -product phases were analysed with a PANalytical Empyrean X -ray 
diffractometer and interpretation of the acquired pattern was performed using High 
score plus. Reacted cubes were studied by scanning electron microscopy -energy - 
dispersive X -ray spect roscopy (SEM -EDS) using a JEOL -JSM-7001 field emission 
SEM. The copper and iron contents in the leach solutions were analysed by using an 
Agilent  240/280  atomic  absorption  spectrophotometer  (AAS)  and inductively  coupled 
plasma atomic emission spectroscopy  (ICP –OES).  
A.3. Results  
 
Initial sample characterisation  
 
XRD and solids analysis indicated that the sample was a mixture of fairly pure 
chalcopyrite with traces of pyrite and quartz. The average initial  chemical  distribution  
 
229 Appendix A  
 
 
was 35.2% Cu, 30.98% Fe and 33.83% S. Dispersed pyrite gangue was present in a 
portion of the cubes (see Fig. A -1).

samples  before  leaching.  a. No cracks  existed  at the peripheries  of the sample,  b. pyrite  gangue

Copper dissolution  
 
The copper dissolution from the chalcopyrite cubes at 170ºC after three weeks is shown  
in Fig. A-2. The chloride  systems  proved  most  effective  at this temperature;  the sample  
in the ferric -chloride  system  dissolved  with only residual  sulfur  remaining  and more 
than 80% copper extraction was achieved in the copper -chloride system after three 
weeks. The copper recovery was below 50% for all other lixiviant systems. The extent 
of copper leaching in the sulfate system, and specifically in the ferr ic-sulfate system, 
was similar to that seen previously in crushed and disk -milled samples (Dutrizac, 1981; 
Hirato et al., 1987; Munoz et al., 1979). The formation of a sulfur layer attached to the 
mineral surface limits continuous contact of the fresh mine ral surface and the solution. 
Systems such as dichromate with hydrochloric acid and hydrogen peroxide with 
glycine showed a low copper extraction at higher temperatures. In the potassium -
dichromate system, the initial solution Eh may have induced the forma tion of an 
impermeable manganese dioxide precipitate that reduced the copper recovery 
compared with expected results from previous studies. Recent studies demonstrate that 
hydrogen peroxide does not significantly enhance copper extraction, and, in fact, ma y 
degrade the lixiviant (Tanda, 2017). Because this study was  based  on literature  
available  at the time,  hydrogen  peroxide  was selected  as an 
230

oxidant. However, at the optimal glycine lixiviant system pH of 11, glycine 
decomp oses above 60°C in the presence of hydrogen peroxide.

Solid reaction products  
 
Reaction product assemblages were mostly consistent for the three samples in each 
system. SEM analysis was used to examine the leach residues to understand the 
reaction mechanism and to explain the copper recovery in the four systems in which 
the copper ex traction was lowest. The appearance of some reaction products in the 
cube experiments can be related to the different reaction rates and the presence of 
gangue inclusions in the starting material. The resulting solid phases included iron 
precipitates, copp er-enrichment zones and other precipitates, such as hematite, 
covellite and bornite. The experimental temperature exceeded the melting point of 
sulfur (115°C), which resulted in sulfur adherence to surfaces and which could have 
created a surface -passivatin g effect.  
 
Ferric -oxidant solutions showed sulfur only as a product layer. As mentioned above, 
the cube in ferric -chloride solution dissolved after 5 days to yield only S0 by XRD 
analysis. A solid sulfur layer formed around the bulk mineral in the ferric -sulfate 
medium (see Fig. A -3a). Sulfur entered small cracks in the sample and replaced the 
dissolved  chalcopyrite  in the final stages  of the experiment.  No intermediate  secondary

mineral phases were found. Pieces of chalcopyrite remained prior to the sulfur layer 
replacement. SEM images indicate that the sulfur layer as formed in the ferric -sulfate 
system  appeared  less porous  than that formed  in the ferric -chloride  system,  which  may 
hinder solution access to the unreacted sample  core.

high sulfur  concentration.  a. Cube  leached  with ferric  sulfate  and sulfuric  acid showing  sulfur

(orange) and goethite (deep green) layer that enters the internal  fractures.  
 
Both systems with cupric oxidant yielded secondary phases. The only difference 
between the systems was the thickness of the intermed iate products and the speed of 
the reaction.  Both  reactions  provided  insight  into copper  enrichment  in secondary  
 
232 
Appendix A  
 
 
phases.  Product  phases  included  S0 and Fe2O3 on the surface.  Intermediate  enrichment 
rims contained minerals, such as Cu 2S, Cu 1.8S and CuS. These intermediate copper 
sulfides represent stages prior to the final dissolution of chalcopyrite and the  recovery 
of Cu2+ in solution. A cross –section through a reacted chalcopyrite cube a fter three 
weeks in a copper -sulfate/sulfuric -acid system at 170°C is shown in Fig. A -3b. The 
map shows an enrichment zone where all iron has been extracted and a secondary 
copper compound, as identified by EDS and XRD, was found to be digenite with a 
standard composition of 22.7%S and 77.6% Cu. The chalcopyrite core had a higher 
iron content, but no other iron –copper minerals were found in the samples. For the 
chloride systems, the development of the rim was faster and the cube was replaced  by 
a new iron -deficient layer after three weeks. Elemental sulfur replaced the digenite 
face for stronger  oxidant  concentrations  before  the complete  dissolution  of the sample 
(Fig. A-4).

A textural analy sis of cubes in the potassium -dichromate system with chloride -ion 
addition in a hydrochloric -acid environment after three weeks revealed a layering of 
compositionally  distinct  reaction  products  on the cube  surface.  No sulfur  was found  as 
a product in this system. The inner layer was enriched in copper and an iron -deficient 
layer  with an average  composition  of 24.3%  S, 1.7%  Fe and 74% Cu was present  in 
 
233 
Appendix A  
 
 
fractured areas. Outer parts of the cracks presented a composition that was similar to 
that of CuS (66%  Cu and 34.18%  S). The intermediate  layer  was copper -deficient  and 
was identified by XRD as hematite with a composition of 69.3% Fe and 31% S. The 
outer layer was identified as Cr(III) oxide (Fig. A -3c). Limited information exists on 
product formation in such systems. Existing reports only provide information on 
systems below 97°C for concentrate and crushed sample, and no surface analysis of 
the mineral  is available.  According  to the Pourbaix  diagram  for Cr speciation,  at higher 
temperatures modelled by geochemist workbench (GWB), the range of pH where 
dichromate is stable decreases (See chapter 2), and the window for precipitation 
expands. Under the stoic hiometric criteria of oxidant composition and the acidic 
conditions, the formation of Cr(III) is expected at the system solution potential (863 
mV). In previous studies with milder oxidant conditions, the presence of this 
passivation layer was not found; i nstead, an elemental sulfur layer was found to 
surround the particles in a similar manner as occurs in ferric systems (Antonijević et 
al., 1994). The layers hinder  dissolution.  
 
Standard experimental conditions of 170°C were applied for all systems. Leaching in 
glycine was found to be highly dependent on pH and temperature conditions. Above 
60°C, the solution pH decreased and at a low pH and high temperature, the glycine is 
though t to have decomposed to form ammonia. Glycine systems with oxygen or 
oxygen/peroxide as oxidant(s) are not ideal for use in batch reactors because pH 
control and oxidant replenishment are not possible. It is therefore possible that the 
initial oxidant was exhausted despite the excess addition, which yielded a poor final 
recovery after three weeks. The sample surface was coated with goethite and turned 
red but this layer did not appear to passivate the sample surface (Tanda, 2017). SEM - 
EDS analysis indicate d the presence of a rim of goethite and bornite of uneven 
thickness (Fig. A -3d). Bornite was identified in all samples from 24 h to three weeks. 
No sulfur formation or gangue dissolution was evident and the variation in thickness 
of the bornite rim between  the first and last experiment was negligible. In addition to 
the replacement rim at the outer parts of the reacted cube, replacement reactions 
resulted  along  fractures  that extended  into the cube  interior.  Fractures  were  frequently 
surrounded by a copper -enriched reaction halo even if they were not connected to the 
outside perimeter. These fractures may not be connected in the two -dimensional  SEM 
images but may be connected in the third dimension (Fig.  A-5).

A.4. Discussion  
 
Each natural chalcopyrite cube differed between experiments and the chemical 
elemental distribution and the natural dissemination of gangue differed for each case. 
For coarse  samples  in heap  leaching  or natural  samples  in a subsurface  ISR operation, 
the mi neral is impure and is not crushed, and its accessibility is affected by the 
surrounding gangue and lack of natural fractures. The copper extractions that were 
obtained in some systems are encouraging, but, based on the cube size, reaction times 
for coarse  material may be considerable, even at the high set point temperature 
(170°C).  
Iron oxidants are used most commonly in hydrometallurgical processes because of 
their cost and availability. The results from the study with ferric oxidant confirm the 
temperatu re dependence of the copper extraction, which is especially important in 
sulfuric -acid environments where sample passivation with sulfur reduces the reaction 
rate. The introduction of sulfur into natural fractures obstructs access channels and 
surface  contact with solution.  Even  though  the sulfur  layer  appears  not to impede  flow, 
the time for recovery and maximum dissolution were affected. The difference in 
copper leaching between sulfate and chloride media and the product textures with 
copper and iron addi tions support the statement on changes in the product -layer 
morphology,  where  sulfur  in the sulfate  system  was found  to be more  compact  and 
235 
Appendix A  
 
 
dense than that in the chloride system (Hirato et al., 1986; Hirato et al., 1987). It is 
possible that chloride -ion addition facilitates the breakdown of passive films and 
enhances chalcopyrite dissolution by maintaining continuous flow between the fluid 
and the core (Dreisinger,  2006),  or the reactions  and the form  in which chalcopyrite  is 
redistributed are  different.  
When  cupric  ions existed  in the leaching  environment,  the dissolution  of iron from  the 
copper sulfide sample was higher than in any other system. In a CuCl 2 solution, for 
each mol of copper that enters the fluid, more than three times the iron was initially 
dissolved, followed by copper dissolution into solution and the appearance of 
element al sulfur as a final product. However, the reaction rate did not appear to be 
affected or terminated by secondary -sulfide formation. Therefore, chalcopyrite 
underwent multiple dissolution stages with the formation of enriched products in the 
perimeter and cracks of the  sample.  
The potassium -dichromate and potassium -permanganate systems are not used 
commercially in the mining industry. Leaching information on these systems is 
restricted  to a few publications  and the results  in this work.  Potassium  dichromate  may 
present  several  environmental  issues  in an in-situ operation  as it is toxic,  corrosive  and 
flammable under certain conditions (based on MSDS). This system proved prone to 
passivation -layer formation or precipitation under specific pH and Eh ranges, wh ich 
could prevent dissolution and result in the blockage of access paths. Optimal pH and 
Eh control may be difficult to achieve in practice, because of fluid injection and 
recovery  conditions  at the surface,  and the effect  of residence  time on the fluid  pH and 
the initial contact with the formation. Precipitates that were identified in the initial 
experiments provide an indication of the possible concerns of the nature of these 
systems at high temperature. To better understand the real efficiency of  copper 
recovery, these two systems require further experimentation under lower -temperature 
conditions and with higher acidities to confirm whether they perform  better.  
The glycine system is marketed as an environmentally friendly lixiviant alternative 
with a proven  effectivity  for heap  leaching  (Tanda,  2017).  The conditions  used on this 
test work  and the oxidant  type were  sub-optimal  and the copper  recovery  was affected. 
Hydrogen peroxide is not believed to be the most effective oxidant for glycine, 
howeve r, alkaline  systems  are a good  alternative  to acid systems  to avoid  gangue  
 
236 Appendix A  
 
 
reactions (glycine did not react with pyrite in the sample). A different oxidant in the 
glycine system should provide better results. For example, the continuous injection  of 
oxygen may act as a suitable oxidant for the system, as evidenced in studies that  with 
other  oxidants  (Nicol,  2018;  Oraby  and Eksteen,  2014).  Even  though  the selectivity  of 
glycine is a favourable factor for heap -leaching operations, it could be deleterious for 
operations where the accessibility is low. The lack of natural fractures ma y limit the 
flow and subsequent reactions in this system. This implies a necessary  introduction of 
new fractures in the  mineral.  
The greatest hindrance for some of the studied systems is the requirement for 
temperatures  above  90°C  and extended  reaction  times  to achieve  at least 40% recovery 
in the fairly impure chalcopyrite cube. Required copper oxidant concentrations were 
smaller than in any other system, and cupric - and ferric -ion regeneration may be 
possible.  
Some  of the results  from  extensiv e research  into ferric -ion heap  leaching  under  low to 
moderate temperatures have been corroborated in our initial experiments at high 
temperatures.  The good  results  observed  with ferric  oxidant  systems  above  100°C  and 
the temperature dependence postulate t hat this system is the best option for medium - 
to high-temperature  ore processing.  Other  operational  concerns  may interfere  with the 
lixiviant  applicability  because  of the aggressive  behaviour  of the chloride  environment 
and sulfur formation in the sulfate  system.  
In the ferric chloride/hydrochloric acid system, sample dissolution occurred in less 
than 5 days, including iron gangue dissolution. The final pH of the sample did not 
show a substantial variation in free acidity, which may imply a higher reagent 
consumption. In an ISR operation, this lack of selectivity could represent a kinetic 
advantage if the accessibility of the sample is low, but also a major operational problem  
because  of possible  subsidence  from mineral  dissolution,  which  may produce 
mechanical problems with casing, tubing or packers inside the well, and the 
contamination  of surrounding  water  by solution  leakage.  The aggressive  nature  of this 
solution  and its incompatibility  with common  materials,  such as stainless  steels,  could 
require exotic high -cost materials with a shorter lifespan. The same concerns apply to 
copper -chloride  solutions.  
 
 
 
237 Appendix A  
 
 
A possible  application  of copper  as an oxidant  may include  its combination  with other 
oxidants. In an ISR scenario, the injection of mixed oxidants in stages with "soaking" 
times would facilitate the interaction of injected oxidant and recovered copper as part 
of the leaching system. It is important to und erstand the required reaction times of  the 
systems with the intention of extrapolating these data to operational times. The 
reactions of chalcopyrite even above 170°C are slow. Alternative systems were of 
similar success to these common of systems in indus try, which indicates that 
experimentation should proceed with new mixed systems or staged treatment with 
different  solutions.  
Almost all systems generated a “passivation layer”, but the nature of these layers 
varied between systems. Copper -enriched sulfide s are more readily leached, 
sometimes without oxidant addition. The continuous and large -scale conversion of 
chalcopyrite in an operation may be cheaper with less environmental damage with  the 
use of environmentally friendly  lixiviants.  
 
 
A.5. Conclusions  
 
Results from screening tests on cubic samples with several oxidants under the same 
conditions indicated that the alternative systems tested do not offer an improved 
leaching rate compared with more traditional systems. The stability of alterna tive 
oxidants, such as potassium dichromate and glycine, indicated a major probability of 
product formation that would affect fluid access to the mineral surface.  
Chalcopyrite dissolution appeared to include the replacement of initial mineral by 
secondary copper -enrichment phases. This mineral form on the surface did not  appear 
to hinder mineral dissolution; chalcopyrite leaching continued and formed product 
layers  of iron-containing  oxides  on the sample  surface.  The type of copper  sulfide  that 
formed was r elated to the concentration and nature of the solution  used.  
Copper recovery was enhanced for systems that included chloride ions. The effect on 
texture  of the product  layer  improved  the continuous  flow and the sample  accessibility, 
as was evident for the cupric - and ferric -chloride  oxidants.  
 
Each system has a window of optimal operating parameters for optimal recovery, and 
the same  conditions  do not affect  all systems  equally.  The selection  of a suitable  
238 Appendix A  
 
 
leaching system must be based on the specific characteristics of each deposit (depth, 
mineralogy, temperature, pressure, and surface facilities).

Appendix B. Staged leaching of bornite with acidic solutions at 
moderate temperature in an in -situ recovery environment  
 
 
Sequential -staged leaching with different lixiviant and oxidant systems may be viable 
in an in -situ recovery (ISR) environment and may  provide an opportunity for the 
leaching of refractory minerals if these can be converted into more readily leachable 
secondary  products.  An understanding  of the leaching  behavior  of secondary  products 
when in contact with a different lixiviant system from  that used in the first leaching 
stage may provide valuable information for ISR operations. Bornite (Cu 5FeS 4) has 
been  found  to be replaced  by secondary  sulfides,  such as covellite  and chalcocite,  when 
leached with acidic solutions with restricted oxidant. The secondary sulfide phases 
may be easier to oxidize or passivate the surface and reduce the reaction rate. The 
leaching of resulting products of chalcopyrite, such as the dissolution of bornite that 
formed from the sulfurisation of a chalcopyrite concentrate in the presence of  gaseous 
sulfur has been addressed previously, but, to the authors knowledge, a sequential 
analysis  of refractory  coarse  copper  sulfide  samples,  such as bornite,  which  have  been 
leached previously in acid solutions with a second -stage dissolution in 
oxidant/lixiviant solutions has not been undertaken. In ISR, mineral contact with acid 
may result in viable oxidant solutions for copper sulfide leaching; for example, after 
acid dissolution,  iron oxides  and hydroxides  may provide  a source  of iron(III)  oxidant.  
A synthetic goethite sample was dissolved in methanesulfonic acid to obtain a ferric 
methanesulfonate lixiviant for bornite leaching. A natural sample of bornite with 
quartz  was cut into coarse  pieces  and leached  sequentially  with two different  solutions 
(hydrochloric acid followed by ferric methanesulfonate solution). The first stage was 
performed in a closed incubator for a maximum of 20 days and the second stage was 
conducted over two days in a Parr reactor at 110°C. Leaches were conducted wit h 
minimum oxygen present to simulate an ISR  environment.  
This paper presents results on the chemical composition of the solutions after each 
stage,  and a cross -sectional  analysis  of the samples  post-leaching,  as determined  by X- 
ray diffraction, scanning e lectron microscopy and quantitative evaluation of materials 
by  scanning  electron  microscopy  (QEMSCAN).  Information  is  provided  on  the 
243 Appendix B  
 
 
dissolution efficiency, product identification and an analysis of final textures. This 
study provides guidance on the potential for application of sequential staged leaching 
to ISR and for the treatment of refractory copper sulfides in an ISR environment.  
 
 
B.1. Introduction  
 
Global reserves of copper ores have declined in recent years; average copper grades 
have fallen, and the global demand has increased. In 2016, the average copper grade 
in mines was 0.62% because of a reduction in the number of high -grade mines. In 
recent y ears, 10% of primary copper production has been by hydrometallurgical 
processing (Calvo et al., 2016). Further reductions in the number of shallow reserves 
are expected in future, which may make heap leach processing more difficult and, in 
many cases, unec onomic. In -situ recovery (ISR) represents an alternative for copper 
recovery in challenging mine sites (low –grade deep ore bodies, and residual mines). 
Even though ISR is well known for uranium processing and has been applied in pilot 
programs for treating  copper oxide zones (Seredkin et al., 2016), the processing of 
refractory copper sulfides, such as chalcopyrite, bornite and enargite, by ISR presents 
a challenge that requires extensive research.  
 
The slow dissolution and low total recovery of copper sulf ides suggests that an 
extensive leaching period could be required in an ISR application. Extensive reaction 
times may incur additional costs, with higher oxidant and acid consumptions and the 
possible  passivation  by product  layers  because  of fluid  saturati on and pH changes.  Iron 
oxides and (oxy) hydroxides, such as goethite, may be present in supergene zones in 
copper deposits (Cook, 1988) or these may be a product of shallow weathering 
(Özdemir  and Dunlop,  2000)  and may constitute  a source  of iron for use as an oxidant 
in leaching. In hydrometallurgical processing, iron -containing minerals are often 
considered  to be gangue  minerals,  and an alternative  use of these  may represent  a cost 
saving in ISR operations. Ferric ions have been proven to be a viable oxidant for 
bornite leaching (Dutrizac et al., 1970; Pesic and Olson, 1983).  Recently, 
methanesulfonic acid has attracted attention as a viable lixiviant for hydrometallurgical 
processing because of its high solubility of heavy metals and less corrosive character 
compared with other strong acids (Feng et al., 2015a; Feng et  al., 
 
244 Appendix B  
 
 
2015b; Gernon et al., 1999; Hidalgo et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2014a; Wu et al., 2014b). 
Therefore, the use of a solution with ferric ions from a mineral source, in 
methanesulfonic acid, may be a valuable alternative in economic and environmental 
terms for I SR operations. Sulfonate anions complex strongly with metal ions with the 
potential to form highly polymeric materials (Gernon, 1999; Haynes et al., 1981). 
Goethite was selected in this test work because it is a major component of terrestrial 
soils and it is soluble in acid according to Equation 1. This met one of the objectives 
of this work  which  was to prepare  an oxidant  in an acidic  medium  from  the interaction 
between a natural source of iron and a strong organic acid for potential use in an ISR 
applicat ion.

Bornite and chalcopyrite are the most abundant copper minerals and often co -exist 
naturally. Bornite and chalcopyrite dissolution in acid medium follow similar steps 
with bornite leaching more rapidly than chalcopyrite but being able to form the same 
produ ct layers.  The electrochemical  dissolution  of chalcopyrite  in acid has been  found 
to follow a consecutive reduction –oxidation process with bornite as an intermediate 
before  the final formation  of covellite  (Zhao  et al., 2015).  The secondary  formation  of 
bornite as a product of chalcopyrite has been studied in hydrothermal solutions and 
from sulfurisation (Veloso et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2014) and it has been found that 
the extent of copper dissolution from the resultant bornite is considerably higher than  
direct dissolution of the original chalcopyrite. Veloso et al. (2016) also found that the 
resultant bornite has comparable behaviour to natural bornite. Bornite transformation 
to covellite in acidic solutions has been observed during bornite leaching (Hid algo et 
al., 2019; Muszer et al., 2013; Price and Chilton, 1980; Price and Chilton, 1981). The 
transformation  may occur  because  of the direct  oxidation  of bornite  (Equations  2 to 3). 
The dissolution of the resulting covellite has been noted as a fundamental aspect of 
overall bornite dissolution (Zhao et al., 2015).

Pre-treatment  is a technique  that has been  used to optimize  the recovery  of metals  from 
heap leaching operations. Approaches have been proposed for curing and 
agglomeration  via acid addition  (Lu et al., 2017)  and, more  recently,  an acidic  sodium 
chloride  pre-treatment  has been  tested  to enhance  the copper  dissolution  of mixed  fine 
partic les and concentrates  of primary  copper  minerals  (Bahamonde  et al., 2017;  Cerda 
et al., 2017).  The application  of a pre-treatment  in ISR operations  requires  an improved 
understanding  of the coarse  sample  response  to the fluid  and to the product  layers  that 
are formed. The aim of this research was to analyse resultant solution compositions 
and solid residues after a two -stage leaching treatment of coarse bornite particles 
process,  namely,  hydrochloric  acid pre-treatment  followed  by contact  with an acidified 
iron(III) solution at medium temperature.  
 
Initial samples and analytical techniques  
 
 
Natural  samples  of bornite  from  a private  collection  were  cut into coarse  pieces  of ~64 
mm3 volume. A portion of the initial sample was milled for inductively coupled 
plasma –optical emission spectroscopy (ICP –OES) and X -ray fluorescence (XRF) 
analysis. Blank samples were mounted in resin and polished for X -ray diffraction 
(XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements for initial sample 
characterisati on. The initial  energy -dispersive  X-ray spectroscopy  (EDS)  analysis  was 
used as a baseline for secondary -product identification. After leaching, the samples 
were mounted on stubs and examined by SEM to study the unpolished surfaces. 
Thereafter, polished ep oxy mounts were prepared for XRD, SEM -EDS and 
QEMSCAN analysis. The instruments used included a PANalytical Empyrean X -ray 
diffractometer, JEOL -JSM-7001 field emission SEM -EDS and E430 Pro  Quantitative 
Evaluation  of Minerals  by Scanning  Electron  Microscopy  (QEMSCAN),  respectively.  
Fluid samples were filtered and analysed for free acidity by titration with 0.05 M 
sodium hydroxide after Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complexation and 
using a 904 Titrando. The concentration of iron(II) in solution was determined by 
titration wi th a 0.001 M potassium dichromate solution. Total iron, copper and sulfur 
concentrations were determined by ICP –OES analysis.  
 
 
 
 
 
246 Appendix B  
 
 
Leaching tests  
 
 
Synthetic light -yellow goethite powder (68.9% Fe) was used as the iron source to 
prepare  the oxidant  solution.  To obtain  a solution  of 1 mol L-1 ferric  methanesulfonate, 
stoichiometric amounts of goethite were stirred at 150 to 200 rpm with 
methanesulfonic  acid (100%) in a 300 -mL titanium vessel at 140°C for up to three 
days. The solution was filtered before use and the total ferric iron concentration was 
determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). The ferric methanesulfonate 
solution was prepared b atchwise with a cumulative mass of 10 g of goethite and 100 
mL of concentrated methanesulfonic acid. The ferric methanesulfonate solution that 
was used in the test work was obtained by dilution of the synthesised concentrated 
solution to a 1 mol L-1 ferric  iron concentration.  
Two-stage dissolution experiments were conducted with coarse cuboid samples of 
bornite (Cu 5FeS 4). In stage one, two sulfide cubes were placed in separate 250 -mL 
Nalgene bottles with 30 mL of 0.1 mol L-1 hydrochloric acid solution with an initial 
pH of 0.83 (vs. S. H. E) and a solution  potential  (Eh) of 301.3  mV (vs. Ag/AgCl).  The 
head spaces were flushed with high -purity nitrogen, sealed and placed into a closed 
orbital shaker incubator at 70°C and 100 rpm for 7 or 20 days. Replicate tests were 
conducted. A small amount of hydrogen sulfide gas was produced during the 
experiment (as evidenced by the odour). This gas was vented by opening the bottle at 
24 h intervals  and the head space was flushed with nitrogen each time to restrict oxygen 
ingress into the solution. After the selected time, the fluid was filtered for analysis  and 
the solid  sample  was rinsed  three  times  with deionised  water  and dried  in a standard 
oven  at 30°C. The 1 mol L-1 ferric methanesulfonate oxidant solution that was used in 
the experiments had an initial pH of 0.51 and an Eh of 530 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl).  
The second  stage  of dissolution  involved  the leaching  of the previously  leached  bornite 
pieces and was compared to a control piece that had not been subjected to prior 
treatment.  The samples  were  placed  into a 300-mL titanium  Parr reactor,  covered  with 
70 mL of ferric methanesulfonate solution and closed. Nitrogen was injected into th e 
system at 0.2 MPa pressure to facilitate fluid sampling. The temperature was set to 
110°C to represent potential ISR conditions for deep ore bodies and to accelerate the 
reaction.  The reactor  contents  were  stirred  at 100–150 rpm. Final  pH and Eh values  
247 Appendix B  
 
 
were measured after each experiment. Samples (2 –4 mL) were taken at intervals until 
the final fluid  was recovered  after either  one or two days.  To avoid  contamination  from 
fluid  in the sampling  tube,  an initial  sample  was taken  (to flush  the sampling  port)  and 
discarded. A second sample was retained for analysis. Once the final leach time had 
been reached, the sample was rinsed with deionised water and dried for further 
analysis.  
 
 
B.2. Results 
Initial Sample  
XRD  analysis  of the unreacted  material  showed  bornite  as the major  phase  with traces 
of quartz and hematite. No other copper minerals were identified by XRD. Digenite 
(Cu 1.8S) was identified by SEM and QEMSCAN analysis in some samples. A bulk 
sample  composition  of 65% Cu, 16% Fe and 19% S was determined  by ICP–OES  and 
XRF analysis. The composition determined by SEM –EDS was 60.9% Cu, 11.5% Fe 
and 27.6%S for the bornite and 78. 5% Cu and 21.8% S for the digenite phase. The 
particle surface showed no evidence of oxidation rims or sulfur products. The surface 
texture showed a minimum amount of natural fractures and no marked porosity (Fig. 
B-1). A sample cross -section showed a clea n surface with veins of digenite but no 
evidence for sulfur formation, reaction rims or covellite being  present.

Goethite Dissolution  
 
 
The resultant concentrated ferric methanesulfonate solution was dark purple and a 
small residual amount of black  solids was recovered after filtration. XRD analysis of 
the resulting  solids  indicated  that the solids  were  composed  of hematite.  The final iron 
concentration in solution was 1 mol L-1 and the acid concentration was 2.87 mol  L-1. 
 
Acid Pre -Treatment  
 
 
Samples with a similar cubic size and mass (between 0.17 and 0.20 g) were selected 
for acid pre -treatment with hydrochloric acid. The pre -treatment solution and contact 
time were selected based on previous experiments that indicated th e formation of 
covellite after hydrochloric acid leaching in the absence of an oxidant (Hidalgo et al., 
2019). The copper dissolution was slow; 6% and 15% copper extractions were 
achieved  after 7 and 20 days,  respectively.  Iron was dissolved  preferentially  with more 
than 40% dissolution after 20 days. Final solids showed changes in composition and 
surface texture. After seven days of pre -treatment, the original bornite colour was 
replaced by a bright blue colour, and this colour darkened after 20 days. Samp les 
showed pronounced cracks distributed over the surface and an increased number of 
surface cracks after 20 days of pre -treatment (Fig. B -2a). After seven days, an iron - 
depleted surface layer with a Cu/S ratio of 2.17 was formed (average concentrations 
of 65.9%  Cu and 28.5%  S). Iron was still present  in regions  of the sample,  with average 
concentrations below  5%.

After  20 days of acid treatment,  a cross –section  of the sample  showed  a rim of covellite 
covering the perimeter and internal features (such as fractures) that came into contact 
with the fluid (Fig. B -3); other images not shown here confirm that the covellite was 
porous. The original bornite was almost entirely transformed into a copp er-deficient 
layer (1.9 Cu/S ratio) with a lower copper average of 51% Cu. Sulfur formation 
occurred in the external fractures close to the covellite rim of the  sample.

Bornite Leaching by Ferric Methanesulfonate  
 
 
Fluid Composition  
 
Replicate untreated and acid pre -treated were leached, one of each for one and two 
days, with fluid sampling to obtain dissolution curves for comparison. For untreated 
samples, copper recovery was calculated relative to the initial sample copper 
concentrat ion (ICP –OES  determined);  for treated  samples  the copper  dissolved  by pre- 
treatment was subtracted from that present in the initial sample. The copper recovery 
data are shown in Fig. B -4. Untreated samples showed between 74% copper 
dissolution after 48 h of leaching. The copper dissolution from samples that were  pre- 
leached with hydrochloric acid for 7 days was 81%, with the first 50% of copper 
dissolution being obtained after 4 h, which was significantly more rapid than for the 
untreated  sample.  After  5 h, the dissolution  rate decreased  and started  to match  that of 
the untreated  samples.  Because  of mineralogical  differences  between  samples,  a small 
difference in copper dissolution between replicates was expected. The difference in 
dissolution during the f irst 5 h of leaching between the untreated and pre -treated 
samples (Fig. B -4a) was found to be statistically significant (t -test, p = 0.05). The 
sample  that had been  pre-leached  for 20 days showed  an increase  in copper  dissolution 
over the shorter leaching time and reached an 87% final copper dissolution with a 
faster  dissolution  during  the first six hours  of leaching.  Fig. B-4b compares  the copper 
dissolution  averages  for the untreated  and pre-treated  samples.  The stand ard deviation 
between replicates was below 3%.  
The pre -treated samples showed a lower acid consumption during the second stage 
than the untreated samples. The pH values increased by 0.2 units during the reaction 
and the Eh values decreased from 530 mV to 493 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl). The total iron 
concentrati on was obtained by ICP –OES analysis, the ferrous concentration was 
determined by potassium dichromate titration, and the ferric consumption was 
determined by using the difference between these values. Similar ferric  consumptions 
resulted for the untreated sample and pre -treated samples although the ferric 
consumption  by the untreated  sample  was double  that of the pre-treated  sample  during 
the initial 6 h of leaching. The final ferric consumption was between 8.7% and 11.5% 
for all samples after 48  h.

Untreated Sample  
 
The untreated samples had the appearance of a dark -grey, rough solid that was brittle 
and broke easily. Surface analysis showed partial covering of the remaining bornite 
and minor  parts  of covellite  product  layers  by sulfur.  After  24 h, the sample  had major 
fractures of the bornite and showed initial sulfur production. After 48 h, the sample 
consisted mainly of sulfur with some residual solids having chemistries that 
corresponded with high sulfur covellite (62.7% Cu wi th 37.3% S) and a Cu 5-xFeS 4 
(average concentrations of 46.3%Cu, 14.7%Fe and 37.6%S). Digenite veins of the 
original sample were not present in the final solids, although covellite was found in the 
centre of the residue in the form of  veins.  
 
 
Seven -Day Pre -Treated Sample  
 
The 7 -day acid -treated sample presented similar features to the untreated sample; 
sulfur  covered  most  of the solid  with sections  of undissolved  copper  enrichment  in the 
form of covellite. After 24 h leaching, sulfur was present as only a s mall portion of 
solids with covellite existing at the perimeter between sulfur and the Cu 5-xFeS 4 
intermediate. After 48 h of leaching the sample was dark grey and broke into pieces. 
SEM and QEMSCAN examination showed the main phase was sulfur and pieces of  
the remaining bornite with a low copper content and high concentrations of sulfur 
(47.9% Cu, 14.0% Fe and 37.9% S). Covellite was present in the sample as a rim that 
surrounded the bornite solids and replaced pieces that were enclosed by sulfur. After 
QEM SCAN analysis, a higher mass% of covellite was present in the final pre -treated 
sample than in the untreated sample (Fig. B -5).

to sulfur and the remaining pieces of bornite showed copper dissolution and a very 
high concentration of sulfur because of the major transformation (average 
concentr ations of 48.9% S, 12.8% Fe and  38.2%Cu).

B.3. Discussion  
 
Commercial alternatives exist for the pre -treatment of copper sulfides for heap 
leaching applications, These include the CLEAR process, which involves a 
combination of chloride pre -treatment at 105ºC followed by pressure leaching at 
150ºC, and Cuprochlor, which involves the leaching of chalcocite by the initial 
addition of calcium chloride as an agglomerant, and the addition of Cl- and Cu2+ for 
subsequent leaching (He rreros et al., 2005). Two previous studies presented a low - 
temperature (20ºC to 50ºC) and fine -grained (below 150 µm) process for primary 
copper sulfides by pre -treatment with sodium chloride and sulfuric acid followed by 
leaching using Cu2+ in acidic sol utions, and found an enhanced copper dissolution 
(Bahamonde et al., 2017; Cerda et al., 2017). The aim of this study was to trial pre - 
treatment conditions that may be applicable in an ISR environment, where the 
accessibility is limited. Therefore, a study  of the resultant mineralogy from the fluid – 
rock interactions was undertaken, as this has not previously been considered in detail. 
Our study used chloride addition via hydrochloric acid without oxygen addition in  the 
 
255 
Appendix B  
 
 
first stage, to simulate the low oxygen solubility at higher temperatures in an ISR 
environment (Bartlett, 1998), followed by leaching with ferric ions as an oxidant.  
It has been proposed that copper –enrichment layers passivate the surface of primary 
sulfides (Warren et al., 1992). Nevertheless, it is also well known that copper 
enrichment  layers,  such as covellite  and chalcocite,  are readily  oxidised  compared  with 
chalcopyrite and bornite and that lower oxidation potentials are needed to achieve 
significan t copper dissolution (Li et al., 2013; Warren et al., 1992). Figure B -7 shows 
a schematic of the solid residues found after the staged leaching process had been 
applied.  The results  from  our experiments  support  the theory  of the replacement  of the 
original  mineral by a more leachable rim  phase.

Untreated Samples  
 
Copper dissolution in the untreated samples reached more than 70% in all samples. 
The final products corresponded to those in the pre -treated samples. Cu 5-xFeS 4 was 
present in pieces that were surrounded by sulfur, as was evidenced previously in the 
ferric  sulfate  leaching  of bornite  (Dutrizac  et al., 1985;  Dutrizac  et al., 1970;  Ugarte - 
 
 
 
256 
Appendix B  
 
 
Alverez, 1971; Ugarte and Burkin, 1975) Covellite was the major phase in the final 
residue  and was found  in sections  of the sample  and not as a rim of the original  bornite.  
The original sample was composed mainly of bornite, but pieces of the sample 
presented digenite veins. The digenite that was in contact with the lixiviant was 
converted to covellite and dissolved copper (Thomas et al.,  1967), which may  explain 
why the pre-treated  and untreated  samples  presented  the same  final products.  Covellite 
has also been identified in sulfate solutions in previous studies (Dutrizac et al., 1985) 
because  of the interaction  of Cu3FeS 4 and copper  in solution  (Equation  4). It is possible 
too, that the presence of this phase enhanced the expected dissolution by addition of 
internal zones of readily leachable  covellite.

Pre-Treated Samples  
 
After pre -treatment, a replacement of bornite by covellite occurred under all 
conditions. Such behaviour has been found previously for the contact of bornite with 
acid with and without oxygen (Hidalgo et al., 2019; Muszer et al., 2013; Pesic and 
Olson, 198 4; Price and Chilton, 1981). SEM analysis showed a cracked sample 
surface, presumably because of the volume change during the reaction, and the 
resulting covellite showed a porous texture, which is presumed to have allowed the 
fluid  to continue  to contact  the solid  surface.  Rapid  iron dissolution  resulted  during  the 
first days of the pre-treatment  reaction  followed  by a minor  dissolution  of copper  after 
three days. The copper in solution increased the dissolution of bornite and enhanced 
the formation of secondary products, such as copper -deficient bornite (Cu 3FeS 4) and 
more  covellite,  as explained  by Pesic  and Olson  (1984).  Extended  pre-treatment  times 
resulted in an increase in sulfur in the sample, possibly because of the copper in the 
chloride  solution  that reacted  with the covellite  rim and the internal  bornite  (Lundström 
et al.,  2016).  
Samples that were pre -treated showed better copper dissolution than the untreated 
samples. Pre -treated samples showed a noticeably higher dissolution during the first 
five hours of leaching. Five hours may be the time required to dissolve the covellite 
rim that formed  and start the reaction  with the internal  bornite.  Covellite  dissolution  is 
 
257 Appendix B  
 
 
faster  and was found  to leach  preferentially  in the presence  of primary  sulfides  (Peters 
and Loewen, 1973; Petersen and Dixon, 2006). E quation 5 presents the expected 
dissolution  of the newly  formed  covellite  by ferric  ions,  with cupric  ions and elemental 
sulfur as the products. The final dissolution was slightly higher for the pre -treated 
samples,  which  may correspond  to the transformation  to covellite  (a higher  mass  % of 
covellite was found in the treated samples). After this new phase dissolved , an initial 
rapid  dissolution  of copper  occurred  to form  a Cu3FeS 4-type mineral  that continued  to 
dissolve and form sulfur (Dutrizac et al., 1985; Dutrizac et al., 1970; Pesic and  Olson, 
1983; Ugarte -Alverez, 1971), as was identified in all samples  analysed.

Applicability to ISR  
 
The results  of this study  highlight  the applicability  of acid pre-treatment  for the in-situ 
leaching of primary copper sulfides. Copper enrichment, here found to occur via the 
formation of covellite, did not lead to passivation behaviour, and leaching was 
accelerated by the transformation of the initial sample. This has also been confirme d 
in experiments with fine -grained particles (Bahamonde et al., 2017; P. Cerda et al., 
2017). Primary sulfide transformations are a key factor in the ISR of refractory 
sulfides. Transformations can occur even in the presence of minimum oxidant addition, 
and the resulting phases are easier to leach and are porous, which may improve the 
accessibility within the ore. For the ISR processing of a high -grade ore with 
problematic copper sources, such as chalcopyrite and bornite, pre -treatment is 
therefore a viable  possibility. An extended treatment time is required, but, because of 
the low operational cost, it may be possible to perform a long -term pre -treatment and 
convert  major  parts  of the ore into secondary  phases  followed  by a short -term leaching 
stage  enhanced  by secondary  phase  formation,  as demonstrated  in this study.  However, 
conversion  alone  by acid treatment  (with  the low accompanying  levels  of oxygen)  may 
generate toxic gas (H 2S) at the subsurface, which is inconvenient from an oper ational 
perspective (e.g., pitting in tubing, overpressures) and unwelcome both 
environmentally and, more so, as a potential hazard to living organisms (i.e., leaks). 
Based  on the results,  the pre-treatment  acceleration  of leaching  to enhance  dissolution 
was used to transform  the original  sample  to a more  leachable  form,  which  may also 
 
258 Appendix B  
 
 
induce  fractures  and increase  the accessibility  of the fluid  (which  is a major  advantage 
for ISR). For low -grade ore ISR targets with acid -consuming gangue, the acid may 
also be consumed before the conversion of the primary copper sulfide phase is 
completed, which reduces the advantages of the initial acceleration of copper 
dissoluti on. In such a circumstance, it may be necessary to alternatively consider an 
alkaline  pre-treatment.  
 
 
B.4. Conclusions  
 
After an assessment of the staged dissolution of bornite by acid pre -treatment and ferric 
methanesulfonate solution leaching, the main concl usions were:  
 
 
• The use of iron as a natural oxidant source to generate leaching solutions 
represents a valuable topic for future research. More specifically, the use of 
more soluble iron -containing minerals as oxidant sources may reduce the acid 
strength that is required  for dissolution, which, in turn, would make such an 
option more economically  attractive.  
 
• Acid pre -treatment of refractory copper minerals, i.e. bornite, increased their 
dissolution rate and yielded a higher copper recovery. In practice, the 
implementatio n of long -term pre -treatment stages to improve the conversion to 
secondary products before leaching represents a means to improve resource 
utilisation.  
 
• Products  from  the bornite  replacement  showed  a porous  texture,  which  allowed 
for fluid interaction and increased accessibility in the  system.  
 
• The applicability of the staged dissolution of refractory copper minerals may 
present  challenges  in ISR operations  because  of the variable  nature  of the ores. 
For a chalcopyrite or bornite ore, the initial addition of a low concentration of 
Cu2+ as a replacement  for oxygen  may enhance  the transformation  into a copper 
enrichment phase and avoid hydrogen sulfide  formation.
