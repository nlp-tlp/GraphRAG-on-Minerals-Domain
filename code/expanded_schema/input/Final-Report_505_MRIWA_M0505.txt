EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
Glycine heap leaching is an emerging metallurgical technology with potential to unlock significant value from 
copper oxide, gold and nickel ores. The process has application  for carbonate -hosted ores, and gold 
operations looking to reduce cyanide consumption in leaching operations.  
A recently completed MRIWA funded research project (M505: Glycine Heap Leaching) undertaken by Mining 
and Process Solutions (MPS)  in partnership with Curtin University , looked at the potential application of 
glycine to heap leaching of various ores as an economical method of extracting metals. Understanding the 
performance, scalability and financial feasibili ty of this technology  is considered key to advancing further 
trials for commercialisation.  
The project was supported by Sandfire Resources, Barrick Gold, Coda Minerals (previously Gindalbie Metals), 
Poseidon Nickel and the Minerals Research Institute of W estern Australia (MRIWA).  
The project ran over 2 years from May 2018 until April 2020 and was divided into four programs which cover 
the “Fundamentals”, “Heap physical stability”, “Leach testing” and “Process engineering” .  Included in the 
program of work  was metallurgical test work of seven different ores, consisting of gold, copper and nickel 
samples, that were evaluated through bench scale tests, small open -circuit columns and large 6m high 
columns operated in closed -circuit configuration.  
The project p rovided test results for each of the ore samples provided by the sponsors. In addition to 
delivering these results to the individual sponsors, findings and outcomes from the project can be 
summarised as follows.  
• Glycine will not get biologically consumed,  is stable in solution and can be recovered easily by such 
methods as nanofiltration.   
• The need for oxygen is necessary to improve the dissolution for both base and precious metals. 
Intermittent flow was found to be particularly effective for precious metal recovery.   
• A simple titration method was developed for glycine determination to aid in process control.  
• Glycine and metal glycinate complexes were found to adsorb onto some ores, but investigations 
showed that most of the adsorbed glycine can be relatively easily removed with a saltwater wash.   
• Glycine with cyanide (branded as the GlyCatTM process) showed that the technology can extract 
precious metals at much reduced cyanide (60% reduction).  
As part of the process engineering work, flowsheet and financial modelling showed that the glycine heap 
leaching would be the preferred option for the treatment of high acid (>30 kg/t) consuming ores (for example 
carbonate hosted copper oxides), for gold ores that contain elevated levels of copper, and mixed copper and 
gold ores where metals can be recovered in a single stage heap leach.

1 INTRODUCTI ON 
Glycine heap leaching is an emerging metallurgical technology with the potential to unlock substantial 
mineral resources in Western Australia and throughout the world .  The application of glycine leach 
technology for the treatment of copper , gold  and ba se metal  ores via heap leaching  is the basis of this 
research investigation.  
The treatment of low -grade base metal ores is typically performed by acid heap leaching but this technology 
also solubilises unwanted metals that require removal prior to producin g a clean final metal product.  
Alternatively, such base metals like nickel, cobalt and copper could be extracted with glycine.  Gold ores can 
also be treated by heap leaching with cyanide but any copper , even nuisance levels of copper, dramatically 
increa ses the cyanide usage which reduces the profitability and the effluent might also require detoxif ication.  
Glycine heap leaching offers an alternative process to not only extract the copper but also the gold in an 
alkaline glycine leachate.  The key advant age of glycine leaching is its chemical selectivity.   Whereas acid  and 
cyanide  tend to leach a wide range of elements from the ore, glycine is very selective for copper  (Cu) and 
other valuable metals (Ni, Co, Zn, Au, Ag).  Significantly, it does not react with acid -consuming carbonate 
minerals  or require detoxification to release waste into the environment . 
Glycine is environmentally benign and very safe to work with.   It is recycled within the process, leading to 
lower operating cost and no special disposal issues .  Considerable work has been performed by Curtin 
University Gold Technology Group (developers of the technology)  but to date this is largely been in tanks 
while heap leaching capabilities have not been fully explored.  This technology is now being commercialised 
by Mining & Process Solutions (MPS).  MPS ’s strategy is to identify the most promising industrial applications 
for Glycine leaching and focus research  and development efforts towards them  to bring this technology to 
commercialisation . 
MPS  and Curtin University with industry support from  Sandfire Resources, Barrick Gold, Coda Minerals  
(previously Gindalbie Metals ), Poseidon Nickel and the Mineral Researc h Institute of Western Australia 
(MRIWA ) have undertaken this research project to evaluate  the commercial opportunities for glycine heap 
leaching through this MRIWA funded project (M505).  The project ran for 2 years from May 2018 until April 
2020 and was divided into four programs which cover the “Fundamentals”, “Heap physical stability”, “Leach 
testing” and “Process engineering” to review the GlyleachTM and GlyCatTM technology for commercialisation  
by heap leaching .  For the first 6 months it was the “Fun damental” program which was the focus, the next 6 
months was the “Heap physical stability” and “Leach testing” programs in 1 m columns while in the last 12 
months was on “Leach testing” in large r 6 m columns and “Process engineering”.  The project has high lighted 
some  challenges  but also opportunities to use this new technology compared to convention al options.  This 
report summarises the activities and main findings on this MRIWA funded project.  
 
2 SUMMARY OF GLYCINE FUNDAMENTALS  
This section of the project was to answer some fundamental questions:  
1. How to detect glycine in solution?  
2. How stable is it?  
a. Chemically?

2.1 DETECTING GLYCINE IN SOLUTION  
A simple titration method was determined through a literature review to be the easiest and quickest way to 
detect glycine in solution.  Preliminary  investigation on other determination methods like the colorimetric 
determination with ninhydrin or fluorometric determination with fluorescamine were found to be too 
sensitive . They  would require considerable dilution for determination which reduced the a ccuracy of th ese 
methods so were abandoned.  The most widely used method in the literature was Sørensen formol titration 
method published in 1909 (Jodidi, 1926).  Formaldehyde  was found to block the amino group  on the glycine 
through formation of methylene glycin e complex  and removed any buffering effects of the amino acid .  The 
titration would then proceed with the carboxylic acid group o n the  glycine  like an acid -base reaction using 
sodium hydroxide as the tit rant.  Through this process , it was thought that it  would determine the amino acid 
or glycine concentration in solution.  The formol method was investigated alongside the simple acid -base 
titration method where hydrochloric acid was used as the titrant, gi ven glycine solutions were alkaline.  These 
solutions were analysed on either a 716 DMS Titrino  or 915 KF Ti‑Touch  auto -titrator.  Both Sørensen formol 
and a modified acid-base titration method  proved to accurately determine the glycine concentration in 
solution ( Figure 1). 
However, the titration methods only determined free glycine so any complexed glycine with metal ions would 
not be detected and it also suffers from ov er estimating the glycine concentration in the presence of 
ammonia, the main degradation product  of glycine .  It was found that t he Australia n Proteome Analysis 
Facility (APAF) at Macquarie University could accurately determine the total glycine concentrat ion in solution  
and also any ammonia that exceeded 0.5 g/L in solution samples.  They analysed all samples through  their 
Waters AccQTag Ultra™ chemistry on a Waters Acquity™ ultra high -pressure liquid chromatography (UPLC) 
system.  Subsequently we found the National Measurement Institute in Melbourne c ould  also analyse glycine 
via a similar  method h owever, the analysis costs  for both  are quite high .

2.2 GLYCINE STABILITY  
Glycine solutions at varying pH and concentration as well as containing  varying concentrations of  either 
NaCN, NH 4Cl, NaC l or copper  (up to a certain concentration)  (or a combination of the se chemicals) showed 
minimal  chang e (<1 mg/L/day or within analytical detection limit)  in the determine d glycine concentration in 
solution  after 1 year ( Table 1).  There  was also minimal change between solutions kept in a fridge, on a bench 
or outside in the sun.  However, glycine solution s containing >0.5 g/L Cu would degrade glycine ( at around 
10-20 mg/L/day) through the reduction of copper glycinate to copper metal  promoted by sunlight ( Figure 2).  
Figure 3 shows the range of temperatures these solutions and column leaches faced throughout the test 
work.

Glycine is readily degraded by microorganisms  but under GlyLeachTM or GlyCatTM conditions their growth and 
subsequent glycine degradation has been determined to be minimal ( Figure 4).  This work was  inves tigated 
by Murdoch University .  Any microbial g lycine  degradation converts directly to ammonia and carbon dioxide 
and showed no intermediate products.

Glycine and metal glycinate complexes do adsorb onto clay minerals , silica,  cement  (Table  2) and  also 
absorbed onto all the ores tested with the amount increasing  by 4 -fold for copper  glycinate when the pH 
increased from 7 to 11 ( Figure 6) and about 8 -fold for glycine when the pH drops from  pH 12 to 7  (Figure 5).  
All samples were a fine pow der of approx. P 80 40 microns  where all tests were undertaken in shaking flasks 
with a fix volume  (100 mL) containing glycine (10 g/L) and/ or copper (1 g/L)  and mass  of solids (1 g) .  A similar 
trend was observed when investigating glycine and copper glyc inate loading onto each pulverised ore sample 
(Figure 7 & Figure 8).  While exper imentally the results varied from 1 to 310 kg/t it has been determine to be 
in the range of 1  to 5 kg/t experimentally with the ore samples tests.  The lower determined results are due 
to crush ore sample compared to a pulverised sample undertaken in this experimental study.  However, it 
has been determined that washing the residue with salt solution (1M) from a pulverised ore sample was able 
to removed 80% of that adsorbed glycine.  Honours report of the student can be made available upon

2.3 RECOVERY OF GLYCINE IN SOLUTION  
Given the solution i n heap leaching would be constantly being recycled, it is likely that the sodium 
concentration in solution would build up if you using sodium glycinate as the reagent so a bleed would be 
needed to manage the sodium concentration.  This bleed would contain glycine so nano-filtration was studie d 
to determine if the glycine can be recovered from such a solution.  This work was undertaken by Veolia Pty 
Ltd.  They showed that membranes could be used to recover  75%  of the glycine if the sodium concentration 
in so lution wa s below 150 g/L ( Table 3).  Any discharge solution can simply be treated to recover the majority 
of the glycine that can be added back into the recycle soluti on.

2.4 EFFECT OF IRRIGATION RATE ON LEACHING  
A copper ( Ore 2 ) and a gold ore (ore 4) were setup in small  column s (1 m)  and irrigated at 3, 6, 9 and 12 
L/m2/hr (6 L/m2/hr is the standard rate) to understand the effect of irrigation rate on  GlyLeachTM and GlyCatTM 
leaching respectively.  It was found the irrigation rate did change the extraction with both GlyLeachTM and 
GlyCatTM.  Increasing the rate above 6 L/m2/hr for GlyLeachTM was found to be detrimental to copper  
extraction  (Figure 9). 
 

 
 P a g e  | 18 
 
Figure 9: Effect of irrigation rate on GlyLeachTM 
 
Likewise, the  best extraction for gold and silver with GlyCatTM was at a rate of 3 L/m2/hr (Figure 10).  Th e 
cause for the increase in dissolution with slow er irrigation rate could be  explained by allowing  more time for 
oxygen to penetrat e into the heap which improves the dissolu tion of precious and base metals . 
 
 
Figure 10: Effect of irrigation rate on GlyCatTM 
 

 
 P a g e  | 19 
Standard irrigation is 10 sec on and 40 sec off but additional tests were run with  irrigating  for 4 days on and 
turning off for 3 days, irrigating for 3 weeks on and turning off for 1 week and irrigating  for 40 minutes and 
turning off for 10 hours .  GlyLeachTM on Ore 2 showed th at duration affects the extraction where if too slow , 
extraction was hampered.  The standard irrigation regime wh ere the irrigation was switched on/off every 
minute, achieved the highest extraction  for the copper ore  (Figure 11). 
 
 
Figure 11: Effect of int ermittent flow on GlyLeachTM 
 
Likewise, the intermittent flow also affected gold and silver dissolution with GlyCatTM (Figure 12).  While gold 
is least affected silver s hows considerable differences in extraction with different intermittent flows.  It is 
believed the intermittent flows aids in oxygen penetration into the column which then improved the  
extraction of silver .  The best result was for the percolation protocol  that had irrigation on for 4 days and off 
for 3 days for GlyCatTM with  the gold ore .

2.5 EFFECT OF CEMENT AGGLOMERATION  
Both the GlyLeachTM and GlyCatTM processes are alkaline and so there is opportunity to enable the use of 
cement to help to bind and agglomerate the ore to maintain heap stability and percolation.  All the ores 
tested showed good agglomeration stability and percolation apart from Ore 2 wh ich contained the highest  
clay and was the finest ore sample that affected the agglomerate stability and percolation.  This ore was used 
to evaluate the effect of cement addition where a series of column tests were undertaken at varying amounts 
of cement w ith Ore 2.  Figure 13 illustrates the effect of cement amount used in agglomeration and the 
achieved copper extraction with GlyLeachTM. 
 
 
Figure 13: Effect of cement addition during agglomerating on extraction  

 
 P a g e  | 21 
 
While the stability even up to 20 kg/t cement addition showed percolation issues the 50 and 100 kg/t 
additions showed no percolation issues or fall in column height  but it  did cause a considerable fall in the 
achievable extraction.  Therefore, there is evidence that there would be a trade -off between the amount 
extracted and cement addition needed to maintain stability and percolation.  
 
3 SAMPLE PREPARATION  AND CHARACT ERISATION  
MPS processe d each ore sample through a common sample preparation flowsheet ( Figure 14).  Each ore 
sample was prepared to -6.3 mm before being split into ho mogenous samples for the various testing.  The 
analyses that were performed on each sample include:  
• Head assay: full elemental suite was performed by Analytical Laboratory Services (ALS) ;  
• Sequential analysis was undertaken at Nagrom ; and  
• Mineralogical exa mination (TGA, XRD, QENSCAN) was performed by Commonwealth Scientific and 
Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO ).

5.2 SEQUENTIAL DETERMINATION  
A sequential diagnostic leach was performed on each ore and results are summarised in Table 6 (copper 
ores), Table 7 (gold ores) and Table 8 (nickel ore).  It can be seen in Table 6 the large majority of the copper 
is acid leachable and associate d with silicate minerals with a little locked in primary and secondary sulphides.  
Ore 6 was the exception where it had a lot of the copper associated with sulphides where only a third of the 
copper was acid leachable.

For the gold ores , Ore 4 exhibited very little of the gold (< 7%) was locked in silicate and sulphide minerals so 
it was expected to leach 95% of the contained gold while Ore 3 had 40% of the gold associated with sulphide 
and arsenic minerals which would limit the gold recovery to  an estima ted maximum of 80%.

5.3 MINERALOGICAL EXAMINATION  
An x -ray powder diffraction (XRD), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and q uantitative evaluation of 
materials by scanning electron microscopy  analysis (QEMSCAN ®) was performed on each ore sample  by 
CSIRO .  These figures have been placed in the appendices.  
 
5.3.1 QEMSCAN  
The summary of the minerals identified during the QEMSCAN are tabulated below ( Table 9).  Selected images 
are shown in Figure 80 (Ore 1), Figure 81 (Ore 2), Figure 82 (Ore 3), Figure 83 (Ore 4), Figure 84 (Ore 5), Figure 
85 (Ore 6) and Figure 86 (Ore 7).   The copper ores were chosen to represent acid consuming ore (Ore 1), ore 
containing clays and carbonate s (Ore 2), ore containing clays (Ore 5) and c opper ore contained in sulphides 
(Ore 6).  The two gold ores (Ore s 3 & 4) were selected to represent a sample contain sulphides minerals and 
the other being a typical quartz base ore to represent a free milling gold ore .  The nickel ore (Ore 7) 
represented  a sulfidic ore.  All ore samples contained clays apart from ore 7.  The copper ores (Ores 2 & 5) 
contained greater than 8% of the mineral content as clays.  The copper  (Ores 1, 2 & 5)  and nickel (Ore 7) ores 
also contained acid consuming minerals of carbo nates, calcite, dolomite, anatase, magnesite, and ferroan 
magnesite where ores 1 and 2 contain between 5 to 9% acid consuming minerals respectively .

5.4 MINERALOGICAL MODELLING AND PREDICTION  
Based on the assay results and the mineralogical information  for each ore samp le a mineralogical model was 
developed  to match the assay determination.  Based on the information we know on which  minerals acid 
and glycine leaches, a predicted extraction for copper and nickel w ere determined  for these ores .  It is 
expected acid should extract more metal than GlyLeachTM but w hile extraction  is important , it is also critical 
to understand what  co-dissolution of other impurities such as Fe and Mg can also influence the decision  as 
these impurities can cause significant downstream problems to SX circuit s for final metal recovery .  It is 
expected acid would leach 85 -94% of the contained copper while GlyLeachTM is expected to extract 70 -88%  
from the se copper ore samples .  The exception would be Ore 6 w here it not intended to acid leach the ore 
due to poor expected response.

Also modelled was the nickel ore  (Ore 7 ).  Given we had no information on nickel oxide leaching with glycine 
it assumed no extraction.  It is predicted that acid should leach 81% of the nickel and 95% of the copper while 
GlyLeachTM is expected to leach 51% of the nickel and 70%  of the copper from this ore sample.  It is also worth 
noting that this nickel sample contain ed significant acid -soluble serpentine and carbonate minerals that 
would require a lot of acid that w ould hamper extraction and make this option inhibitory .

5.5 MINERALOGICAL EVALUATION  
From the above mineralogical information some predictions as to the acid demand, structure of these ore 
samples and any perceived issues or problems that might be expected during leaching.  The QEMSCAN® 
provide d determination of composition, mineral associ ations, size and shape of fine particles using scanning 
electron microscopy and X -ray techniques.  XRD determines  the crystalline material  within the ore sample .  
It is through analysis of these  crystalline phases present ; mineralogical  information  can be determined.  
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) instruments can measure a host of parameters like moisture loss, 
decarboxylation, pyrolysis, loss of solvent, loss of plasticizer, oxidation, and decomposition of minerals and  
biomass within the ore .  TGA simpl y records the sample mass as a function of time as the sample is slowly 
heated and allows one to observe  thermal transformations that are accompanied by mass loss, such as 
desorption or calcination from minerals contained within the ore sample .  Table 12 summarises this 
information.

6 LEACH TESTING  
To ensure the best outcome s a series of preliminary small tests were undertaken to test a range of additives 
to determine  (if any ) had any real benefit.  This was followed up with bottle roll leach testing under a standard 
(acid or cyanide)  and GlyLeachTM or GlyCatTM conditions.  A small column (1 m) was then undertaken before 
a larger column (6 m) test with glycine were setup and monitored .

6.1 PRELIMINARY TESTING  
A number of additives were investigated in small tests to determine if any would assist glycine in leaching 
the ore samples.  These tests are designed to use a small amount of sample and run a range of conditions 
simultaneously in a batch configuration to determine the conditions that gave the best extraction.  What is 
leached into solution is used to determine the extraction based on the assayed head.  The residues cannot 
be analysed due to being too small a sample i.e. accountabilities cannot be determine d but such tests do 
provide  indicative conclusions .  These tests were carried out for 48 hours and a single solution sample taken 
at the end.  The sample was pulverised, so all ores would be 100% passing 75 m.  Table 13 summarises the 
additives that were added during leaching and the below figures summarises the results.  All showed a 
positive response except additive 4 .

6.1.1 ORES 1 & 2 
Various additives were added to the GlyLeachTM where all showed a slight improvement where the biggest 
improvements of 15% was obtained when both A2 and A3 was added.  Acid is expected to leach more from 
these ore samples than GlyLeachTM.

 P a g e  | 32 
 
Figure 19: Leach e xtraction – Optimisation  testing (Ore 2)  
 
Also examined was the addition  of the more promising  additives in a cure for 1 day then glycine leached for 
48 hours.  A1 was chosen rather than sulphuric acid to investigate slightly reducing leach conditions.  Figure 
20 & Figure 21 summarises the results, where clearly there was no benefit for both ores with A1 or mixtures 
but A2 and A3 did show a positive response.  This approach was investigated in small columns and was called 
the optimised test.

6.1.2 ORES 3 & 4 
A similar response was observed with both ores where the GlyCatTM was expected to achieve the same gold 
extraction as cyanide using half the cyanide.  However, lowering the cyanide will lower t he extraction.  While 
both additives of A6 and A7 did show a slight improvement in extraction it was not significant benefit to be 
used.  Note only gold was analysed for these tests.

6.1.3 ORE 5 
As for  Ore 1 and 2 , adding additives to the leach did not improve the extraction greatly.  However, curing for 
a day then glycine leach ing for 48 hours did show a more dramatic improvement.  The extractions were nearly 
double d so this approach was investigated in small colum ns.

6.1.4 ORE 6 
Likewise, for Ore 6 the only additive that seemed to work was a dding cyanide to change the process from 
GlyLeachTM to GlyCatTM.  This is not a conventional leaching option but was the only method that showed 
significant extraction even though there was a slight improvement by curing then glycine leaching.  Further 
testing was undertaken to investigate the cyanide concentrations w here greater than 0.5 g/L proceed  to be 
optimal ( Figure 28).

show a response.  This approach was investigated in small columns .

6.2 BOTTLE ROLL TESTING  
Bottle roll tests were undertaken in 2.5 L bottles that hold 1 L of slurry.  The solids density was kept at 28.6% 
using Perth tap water and was allowed to be leached for 2 days  for all ore samples.  A summary of the leach 
conditions and extraction have bee n tabulated while the extraction s are shown in the figures  below . 
 
6.2.1 ORES 1 & 2 
An acid and GlyLeachTM was undertaken on copper  ores 1 & 2 to represent the traditional v ersus  new 
technology .  The results of these tests have been summarised in Table 14.  The acid bottle roll was maintained 
at pH 1.0 at regular interval throughout the test.

The results showed very similar responses between the two samples with  the acid leach ing more copper then 
GlyLeachTM.  Overall, it would be expected that 90% of the copper would be leached by acid for both samples 
while only around 50% of the copper is leached with GlyLeachTM.

6.2.2 ORES 3 & 4 
For the gold ores , two leach tests were performed on each sample , a cyanidation and GlyCatTM leach  to 
represent the traditional v ersus the  glycine  technology .  Ore 3 had an extra leach at a lower cyanide 
addition.  The results o f these tests have been tabulated in   

 
 P a g e  | 40 
Table 15 and the extraction curves presented in Figure 33 and Figure 34. 
For Ore 3 , three bottle roll test s were performed .  One at 60% reduction in the cyanide a nd another at 90%.  
While clearly adding less cyanide lowered the overall extraction , the different GlyCatTM tests with 60% lower 
cyanide and the cyanidation tests were very comparable.  It would be expected that 85% of the gold and 13% 
of the silver would  be leached from this ore sample.  A similar response was observed for Ore 4 where similar 
extractions were achieved with cyanidation and GlyCatTM extracting 95% of the gold and 75% of the silver.  
The best GlyCatTM conditions were undertaken at 60% l ower  cyanide although the cyanide or glycine 
combination were not optimised for both ores.

The results showed that acid leached more copper then GlyLeachTM reaching a maximum of 78%.  GlyLeachTM 
is slowly leaching the copper so need s a much longer leach time extracting only 17% of the contained copper 
in 48 hours.

6.2.4 ORE 6 
Ore 6  is a copper containing ore.  It was acid and GlyLeachTM tested .  The results have been tabulated in Table 
17 and the extraction curve shown in Figure 36.  The results showed that acid leached very little copper 
compared to GlyLeachTM but the extraction curves were still continuing so once again a longer leach time was 
needed.  A GlyCatTM (glycine with cyanide) leach was not performed as the optimisation test work had not 
been completed before these tests were under taken.

The results showed th e acid would extract 75% of the nickel and copper and 45% of the cobalt .  However,  it 
was also noted that the acid would extract 75% of the iron.  GlyLeachTM extracted 45% of the nickel and 
copper and 12% of the cobalt .  No iron was dissolved.

6.3 MINI COLUMN TESTING  
To gauge the likely extraction with heap leaching a series of small columns (1 m) were undertaken where the 
results have been tabulated and graphically represented below.  The columns were run in open circuit where 
fresh solution was added at each change s o the reagent usage is not a true representation of the likely usage 
in practice .  All columns were left to cure for 1 week before irrigating with solution.   Each column contained 
1.5 kg of agglomerated ore and around 60 L of solution passed through the ag glomerated ore throughout 
the leach.  The column had a diameter of 55 mm and height of 1.2m made from clear acrylic plastic.  
 
6.3.1 ORES 1 & 2 
For Ore 1 an acid and three GlyLeachTM tests were undertaken where one column was agglomerated with 
cement  (10 kg/t) , another cured with 20 kg/t A2 and A3 and another with sulfuric acid with sodium fluoride 
before glycine solution was irrigated.  For the second sample an acid and t wo GlyLeachTM tests were 
undertaken where one column was agglomerated with cement  (10 kg/t) and another cured with 20 kg/t A2 
and A3 before glycine solution was irrigated.  For the acid columns the pH of the leachate started at pH 2 
for about 60 days before being lowe red to pH 1 for the remaining leaching period.

A2 and A4 cure and glycine leach tended to leach more copper (>10%) then cement or sulfuric acid cure and 
GlyLeachTM.  This cure dramatically improved the extraction of copper and made it close to the acid cure and 
acid leach test f or the second ore sample.  For the first sample  GlyLeachTM only leached about half the copper 
while the extraction of copper by acid leaching achieve d similar extractions between the two samples.

The results show that for Ore 3, 90% of the gold and 28% of the silver was extracted within 100 days.  Like 
that undertaken in the bottle rolls the GlyCatTM column was irrigated with 60% of the cyanide addition which 
shows that a similar extraction was ach ieved.  Halving the reagent only lowered the extraction of gold and 
silver by 15%.  Likewise, for Ore 4, 93% of the gold and 30% of the silver was extracted within 100 days.  
Halving the reagent also only lowered the extraction of gold and silver by 15%.

Curing  and glycine leach tended to leach more nickel th an cement and glycine leach.  Using A3 cure also 
achieved similar extraction of nickel to just acid cure and acid leach.  However, if one compares the two 
samples similar nickel extractions were achieved wit h both samples.  A noticeable difference was acid tended 
to leach all the elements while GlyLeachTM leached no iron, only 5% of the cobalt and only copper and nickel 
which was slower to be leached then in acid.

6.4 LARGE COLUMN TESTING  
A large column test for each ore was undertaken where the ore was cement agglomerated (10 kg/t , apart 
from Ore 2 which was agglomerated with 20 kg/t ) and glycine leached.  These columns were undertaken in 
close circuit so a fixed volume of 4 0L was used and reagent periodically topped up  and the solution reused.   
Each time the metals in the PLS were removed either through the use of resin  (Purolite S9300)  or activated 
carbon  (PicaGold)  before returning to irrigate their respective columns.  Ea ch column contained 100 kg of 
agglomerated ore apart f rom Ore 1 and 5 where 40 kg and 60 kg were all that was available.  The column had 
a diameter of 155 mm and height of 6.2  m made from clear acrylic plastic.  
 
6.4.1 ORES 1 & 2 
While adding and curing produced the best result, this was not tested as the typical approach of cement 
agglomeration then GlyLeachTM was examined.  Table 24 summarises the result while the leaching profile in 
Figure 48 graphically compare s the performance to 1 m column performance .

Figure 48 and Figure 49 compares the extraction results achieved in the 6 m column with those attained in 
the 1 m column.  The results show considerably slower extraction for the first ore sample and none for the 
second ore sample.  While the second sample did have percolation issues which lowered the irrigation rate 
to half of the Ore 1 no visible copper was evident in the liquor.

For Ore 3 , the results show slower extraction for first 90 days after which more reagent was added along with 
more at 140 days so the gold continued to leach but ran out of time to achieve the same extraction as that 
attained in the 1 m column.  The silver extractio n was considerably slower but the sudden jump at the end 
was from  the water wash suggesting a good portion of  leached silver had adsorbed onto the ore and was 
removed in the  wash solution.  This suggest silver only weakly adsorb s onto the ore and will  be easily 
recovered if washed.  
For Ore 4 , a slightly slower extraction of gold was observed but still attained very similar extraction to 1 m 
column for the same time period and given the extended time achieved slightly more extraction of gold and 
silver to th e 1 m column.  Similar to the results for Ore 3 , there was an increase in silver extraction at the very 
end due to desorbed leached silver being recovered in the wash solution.

The extraction results showed a much slower copper dissolution from the 6 m column compared to  the 1 m 
column test.  The jump up at the end was due to water wash which liberated some desorbed copper from 
the leached residue.

The results of the GlyCatTM leach has been tabulated in Table 27 and extraction shown in Figure 53.  The 
results showed no visible leaching was evident until 130 days af ter which the copper slowly leached from the

6.5 RESIDUE ANALYSIS  
After 6 months a representative sample of each column was examined to show the change in the residue 
elemental distribution before and after leaching.  
 
6.5.1 ORES 1 & 2 
For Ore 1 , the copper distribution followed the mass which suggests the copper is finely disseminated in the 
ore.  In the second ore sample the copper was mainly in the coarser size fractions.  
 

 
 P a g e  | 67 
 
Figure 55: Distribution of copper in the feed  (Ore 1)  
 
 
Figure 56: Distribution of copper in the feed (Ore 2)  
 
Residue sizing was also performed and these are presented in Figure 57 (Ore 1 ) & Figure 58 (Ore 2).  It would 
appear that copper had leached from all fraction s but there was a noticeable upgrading in the finest fraction 
(-200 µm) with both sampl es from  the 6 m column residues.  This suggest s that the copper had leached from 
the coarsest fractions and redeposited onto the finest fraction s.  This would be expect ed to occur if the leach 
copper had reabsorbed ore precipitated onto the highest surface  area material , being the finest fraction.  If 
one used the typical grade that was achieved in the 1 m column and replace this finer fraction , then a new 
calculated residue grade could be determined which could be used to determine the achieved extraction 
based on the  new  calculated residue analysis.  This has been tabulated in Table 29 where 71.1% and 75.5% 
of the copper would have been leached from these ore s based on the above assumptions.  These results are 
materially different to that  achieved in the 1 m column tests and is in line with what one would have 
expected.

6.5.2 ORES 3 & 4 
For both Ore 3 & 4 , the results show that gold and silver distribution followed the mass where Ore 3 had a 
slight increase in the gold and silver distribution in the finest fraction and Ore 4 had a slight increase in the 
coarsest fraction.  
 
 
Figure 59: Distribution of gold and silver in the feed (Ore 3)  
 
 
Figure 60: Distribution of gold and silver in the feed (Ore 4)  
 
Residue sizing was also performed and are presented in Figure 61 & Figure 62 (Ore 3) and Figur e 63 & Figure 
64 (Ore 4).  For Ore 3 it would appear for the 1 & 6 m column both the gold and silver had leached from all 
fractions except there was a slight increase and more noticeable upgrading in the finest fraction ( -200 µm) 
for the 6 m column.  This suggest s that some of the gold and silver that had leached from the coarsest fraction 
is redeposited onto the finest which is what  we would expect to occur if the leached gold and silver had 
reabsorbed  or precipitated .  If one used the typical grade that was achieved in t he 1 m column and replace 
the finest fraction then a new calculated residue grade can be determined which then can be used to 
determine the achieved extraction by that new residue grade.  This has been tabulated in Table 30 where an 
additional 4% and 8% of the gold and silver would have been leached from these ores based on the above 
assumptions.  

 
 P a g e  | 70 
Likewise, for Ore 4 a similar trend was observed where the gold and silver had leached from all fractions 
except there was an increase in the finest fraction ( -200 µm).  If one used the typical grade that was achieved 
in the 1 m column and replace in the finest fraction then a new calculated residue grade can be determined 
which then can be used to determine the achieved extraction  by that new residue grade.  This has been 
tabulated in Table 30 where an additional 1% gold and silver would have been leached from these ores based 
on the above assumptions.

6.5.3 ORE 5 
For Ore 5 the results show that copper distribution followed the mass where there is a slight increase in the 
coarser fraction.  
 
Figure 65: Distribution of copper in the feed ( Ore 5)  
 
It would appear that copper had leached from all fraction but there was a noticeable upgrading in the finest 
fraction ( -200 µm) with the 6 m column residue .  This suggest that the copper had leached from the coarsest 
fractions and redeposited on the finest  fraction which is what would be expect ed to occur if the leach copper 
had reabsorbed  or precipitated .  If one used the typical grade that was achieved in the 1 m column and 
replace in the finest fraction then a new calculated residue grade can be determin ed which then  can be used 
to determine the achieved extraction  with the new  residue grade .  This has been tabulated in Table 31 where 
60.6 % of the copper would have been leached from these ores based on the se assumptions.

For Ore 6 , the results show that copper distribution followed the mass where there is a slight increase in the 
coarsest fraction.  
 
 
Figure 67: Distribution of copper in the feed for Ore 6  
 
The residue analysis shows the  copper had leached from the coarsest fraction and redeposited on to the finest  
fraction  which is what would be expect ed to occur if the leach metals  had reabsorbed.  This is more 
pronounce d with the 6 m column residue.  If one used the typical grade that w as achieved in the 1 m column 
and replace in the finest fraction then a new calculated residue grade can be determined which then can be 
used to determine the achieved extraction.  This has been tabulated in Table 32 where 7 5.1% of the copper 
would have been leached from these ores based on the above assumptions.

6.5.5 ORE 7 
For Ore 7 , the nickel distribution followed the mass which suggests the nickel is finely disseminated in the 
ore ( Figure 69).  Residue sizing was also performed and are presented  in Figure 70.  It would appear that 
nickel had leached from all fraction s.  There were noticeable falls below 200 µm with a slight increase in the 
finest fraction.  Even though sample 2 feed size was not undertaken a similar curve was achieved in the 
residue analysis.

6.6 PERCOLATION DETERMINATION  
Before terminating the 1 m column s percolation tests were performed.  This is where water was added and 
the rate of water discharging over given time recorded.  The slumpage over the leach test was also recorded 
which is the drop in the height of the ore from the beginning to end of the le ach test.  
 
6.6.1 ORES 1 & 2 
There was a noticeable difference in the slumpage and percolation rate under GlyLeachTM compared to acid 
(Table 33) where the percolation rate fell  in half and the ore slumped by 5 to 18% in acid while only 1 to 2% 
in GlyLeachTM.

There was a noticeable difference in the slumpage between the acid and the various GlyLeachTM leaches 
where once again the acid column  percolation rate halved and resulted in 4%  slump compared to 1% with 
GlyLeachTM (Table 35).

leach.  Similarly,  to that found with the copper ore , the acid column percolation was about half the rate and 
slumped by 4 to 8% compared to 1 to 3% with GlyLeachTM.

7 PROCESS ENGINEERING  
MPS have undertaken an extensive research program into application of glycine leach technology 
(GlyLeachTM & GlyCatTM) to heap leaching of copper, gold, and nickel ores.  Part of th is program of work 
involved modelling process and financial s to assess the economics of glycine heap leaching compared to the 
established technologies.  
The established or convention al process used for comparison to glycine technology for the various type of 
ore is shown in Table 38.

 Recovery  Recovery  Recovery  
 Acid consumption  Soluble copper grade   
 
For each of these ore types, a financial model was built to estimate the revenue, operating cost, and capital 
cost of the conventional and alternative glycine cases.  The sensitivity to key cost drivers w ere examined to 
show where the alternative route offers advantages over the conventional process.  For comparison , the 
usual drivers of grade and recovery  has also been completed for each ore type.  These factors were chosen 
because:  
- Copper ores with high acid consumption are prime candidates for glycine leaching because of the 
high cost of acid as well as the permeability and stability problems caused by b reakdown of the 
gangue minerals;  
- Gold ores with nuisance copper are prone to elevated cyanide consumption, and also high detox 
costs.  GlyCatTM turns the copper from a cost to a revenue stream, and eliminates detox 
requirements; and  
- Nickel sulphides can su ffer from poor flotation recovery due to talc or other gangue minerals.  Glycine 
heap leach offers comparable recovery with lower capital and operating cost, and considerably 
better product quality.  
In each case the goal was to determine a cut -off value fo r each sensitivity factor, beyond which glycine heap 
leaching option appears better than the conventional route.  
 
7.1 ASSUMPTIONS  
Each of the three cases was evaluated for a hypothetical mine with 10 Mt of mineable reserves, mined at a 
rate of 1 Mtpa for a 10 -year mine life.  The ore is assumed to  be leached in 1 Mt heaps and it would be 
operated on an off and on heap i.e. after each year the ore is removed and new ore stacked.  To keep 
production steady there will be two 1 Mtpa heaps in operation.

With all case s, the grade and recovery were varied for each process where the value in the brackets shows 
the common variable used for the standard grade and recovery respectively.  For the copper mine, acid leach 
recovery was assumed to be higher than GlyLeachTM recover y, as typically seen in the test results.  The acid 
consumption was assumed to be 25 kg/t for conventional process and varied up to 100 kg/t to show its effect 
on revenue.  Glycine adsorption or consumption of 0, 1, and 4 kg/t was also undertaken to highli ght that 
impact on revenue.  
Gold recovery was assumed to be the same under both cyanidation and glycine/cyanide (GlyCatTM) 
conditions, although there was experimental evidence that recovery can be higher with GlyCatTM.  The effect 
of grade and recover y calculation was done in the presence of no copper.  To highlight the impact on costs 
with copper in solution , copper content  was varied from 0.002%  Cu to 0.2%  Cu (0.02 to 2 g/L ) in solution.  
The reaction of cyanide with cupric copper was use d to determine th e stoichiometric amount of cyanide that 
would be consumed.  Detox costs were included for cyanide treatment at cost of $0. 32/t in the absence of 
copper and increased to $ 1.50 /t in the presence  of copper . 
Nickel recovery and grade were varied as the key sen sitivity factor.  No cobalt or copper revenue was 
assumed for both cases where the grade was kept at 1%.  The standard recovery was assumed to be 70% for 
GlyLeachTM.  Even though experimental evidence was that recovery was lower , recent test work and research 
that has been performed outside the scope of this project indicates this recovery would be quite achievable.  
Financial inputs were selected as follows:

7.2 CAPITAL COST – HEAP LEACH PAD 
For the copper and nickel cases, the heap leach pad cost was estimated from first principles.  Pad dimensions 
were derived from the assumed stacking rate, leach cycle time, stacking height, bulk density, and angle of 
repose, as listed in the process design criteria (PDC).  
- Assumed on/off pads where there is two 1Mt heaps where one is always being irrigated while the 
other is being removed and restacked;  
- Stacking height was limited to 10 m for both acid leach, and alkaline systems even though there 
would be better geotechnical stability assisted by cement agglomeration;  
- A double lined p ad was used (3.3mm HDPE + 1.5mm plastic), as per modern industry practice;  
- Process ponds, stormwater pond, collection channels, embankments, PLS collection piping all 
included in estimate; and  
- Unit rates for civil works and liners based on a recent (2019) Australian study.  
Detailed cost calculations were undertaken where t he results were compared with published industry unit 
cost benchmarks (Smith, 2014)  and found to be comfortably within the ranges quoted.  
 
7.2.1 CAPITAL COST – COPPE R PROCESS PLANTS  
The conventional and alternative cases used the exact same crushing, agglomeration and stacking system.  
Costs were taken directly from a recent  engineering  study to give a total installed cost of $4.8 million for 
1Mtpa heap.  
The base case  used a conventional solvent extraction and electrowinning (SXEW) plant to produce copper 
cathodes from heap pregnant leach solution (PLS).  The SX capital was scaled from data taken from a public -
domain report (Filippov, 2017) .  The EW cost was derived from a recent published article on cellhouse design 
(Forner, 2018) .  In both cases the ‘0.6 rule’ was used to scale the costs to the required plant throughput rate:  
Cost 1 / Cost 2 = (Size 1 / Size 2)0.6 
For simplicity we assumed the downstream processing for GlyLeachTM consists of a train of sulphide 
precipitation tanks, where sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS) was added to the PLS to form copper sulphide (CuS).  
The solid is separated in a thickener and plate an d frame filter press.  Other equipment includes reagent 
storage and dosing, and a gas scrubber system to capture any hydrogen sulphide release.  
The capital cost was based on major equipment costs taken from a recent engineering study, with factors 
applied for installation and indirect costs, as appropriate for a current day Australian construction project.  
 
7.2.2 CAPITAL COST – GOLD PROCESS PLANTS  
The base and alternative gold processes have the exact same heap leach design and cost.  They also have an 
identical adsorption -desorption -recovery (ADR) plant for gold recovery using activated carbon.  The only 
difference was that the alternative (GlyCatTM) case where copper was present in solution , we evaluated both 
the case to recover  and the case not to  recover the c opper .  Additional capital costs ha ve been included in 
the recovery option where a sulphide precipitation plant is used to recover copper from the PLS.  
There was no detailed capital estimate undertaken for the common equipment.  A lumped estimate for the 
combined heap leach and downstream plant was taken from a published source (Stebbins, 2007) , and scaled 
by the 0.6 rule.  
 
 P a g e  | 81 
The additional cost for the alternative case (sulphide precipitation) was derived from major equipment cost s 
with factors applied for installation and indirect costs, as per the copper comparison.  
 
7.2.3 CAPITAL COST – NICKEL PROCESS PLANTS  
The base case process is a conventional grinding mill and flotation concentrator, producing a concentrate for 
sale.  Whole plant  costs were taken from a published industry database (Stebbins, 2007) , and scaled to the 
appropriate size using the ‘0.6 rule’.  Inflation was also applied at 2.5% per year to convert to 2020 dollars.  
The alternative case is es sentially the same process route as for copper, and so the capital estimate was 
conducted the same way.  Pad cost was derived from first principles as discussed above.  Plant cost was based 
on a listing of major equipment with costs taken from a recent eng ineering study.  Installation factors and 
indirect costs were then added using typical industry factors to arrive at a total cost.  
 
7.3 OPERATING COST 
Operating cost for each case was built up from unit costs for each of the main categories:  
- Mining cost: Based on an assumed unit cost per tonne of ore;  
- Labour cost: staffing levels by position with salary, on -costs, with flights and accommodation 
assuming a remote FIFO operation;  
- Power cost: Unit cost of $0.2/kWh, with consumption estimated from equipment li st or plant -level 
estimates;  
- Reagent cost: from unit costs and consumption rates based on typical industry practice (listed below 
and further discussed below under results for key drivers such as acid, cyanide and glycine 
consumption);  
- Maintenance consumab les: factored as a percentage of direct field cost; and  
- Royalties: assuming a fixed 1% of total revenue on the alternative process and none on base case.

7.4 REVENUE  
Production rates were calculated from the input ore grades and recoveries, as shown on the  process design 
criteria . 
Payable metal content was assumed to be 90% for the high -grade copper and nickel sulphides produced by 
precipitation of glycine leach solutions.  
The base case nickel product was a lower grade sulphide concentrate, with assumed 74% payable metal 
content.   Gold Dore were assumed to have 99% payable metal content.  
Allowances were made for land and sea freight, marketing and insurance.  
 
7.5 MODELLING  
The models were designed to provide a co mparative evaluation of the base versus the alternate case.  Thus, 
there is more detail given to the key differences between the two cases, while there are sweeping 
assumptions made regarding the common factors such as mining cost, infrastructure cost etc.   The absolute 
NPVs are therefore not likely correct, but the comparative  NPV should be a good indication of the relative 
merits of the processes under different circumstances.  Furthermore, the sensitivity cut -off points discussed 
below should be applicab le over a range of project conditions.  
 
7.5.1 COPPER  
The effect of grade and recovery on both base case and alternative cases are shown in the figures  below .  
With the effect of grade, it highlights the difference in costings and the amount extracted between 
conventional acid and alternative glycine technology clearly influenc ing the profitability.  While the glycine 
technology clearly has a lower cost basis th an acid , if it cannot recover the same metal than conventional 
process the conventional process would re main more profitable.

The sensitivity model was run over a range of input conditions for the key drivers of:  
Base case - Acid consumption; and  
Alternative  case - Glycine adsorption or consumption of 0, 1 or 4 kg/t glycine . 
As expected, net present value (NPV) was highly sensitive to reagent consumption rates.  The chart below 
shows that for a low -end glycine consumption of 1 kg/t, GlyLeachTM becomes the preferred route if acid 
consumption exceeds around 25 kg/t.  If glycine consumption is at the high -end of 4.0 kg/t, then the crossover 
occurs at an acid consumption of 45 kg/t.

7.5.2 GOLD 
The effect of grade and recovery on both base case and alternative are shown in the figures  below .  With the 
effect of grade, it highlights there is only a marginal  difference  (~1%)  in costing between conve ntional 
cyanidation to alternative glycine technology.  The difference in the  lower cost basis of GlyCatTM is clearly 
seen with the effect on recovery .  There are also additional  environmental benefits that have been included 
in these evaluations which could significantly sway the choice to glycine technology.

Grade of Gold (g/t)
Cyanidation GlyCat

 
 P a g e  | 85 
Increasing levels of cyan ide soluble copper (“nuisance copper”) create elevated cyanide consumption.  The 
model assumed:  
Base case – Cyanide consumption is based on the stoichiometric amount of cyanide that will react 
with soluble cupric copper which is close to the 40 kg/t per % of cyanide soluble copper, typical used 
for a mixed oxide -sulphide ore (Sceresini, 2016) . 
Alt case – With and without recovering the copper in solution.  
Under these conditions, the GlyCatTM approach is preferred for any  soluble  copper in solution.  If the copper 
was also recovered where there is additional capital cost to install sulphide precipitation, the increasing 
copper improves the valuation due to the additional revenue stream, in contrast to cyanidation where copper 
just creates extra reagent and detoxification costs.

7.5.3 NICKEL  
Glycine heap leaching offers a significantly lower capital and operating cost compared to conventional 
grinding and flotation of nickel sulphides.  However, the recovery of both routes can vary widely, depending 
on the ore mineralogy.  A high grade, pure nickel sulphide is produced from GlyLeachTM PLS, whereas flotation 
plants can struggle with low concentrate grades, and may sacrifice recovery in order to produce a saleable 
product.  Payable metal content is thus much higher with GlyLeachTM, and the model assumes 90% versus 
74% for the flotation c oncentrate.  
Due to the recovery difference between the conventional vs. glycine technology the conventional options 
would  always  be more economic.  
 

 
 P a g e  | 86 
 
Figure 78: Effect of  nickel  ore grade  
 
However due to the lower costs combined wi th higher payable metal content result in a ‘recovery differential’ 
of over 1 9% for equivalent NPV, as shown in the graph:  
 
 
Figure 79: Effect of nickel  recovery at a grade of 0.75%  Ni 
 
Thus, if glycine heap leach can achieve grea ter than 36% nickel recovery than it becomes the preferred route  
over flotation .  Given the flotation performance is hampered with grade, the glycine technology offers a 
viable option to treat low -grade deposits or waste nickel streams due to the lower cos t basis  and likely better 
performance to flotation .  However, if one includes the costings to process the flotation concentrate to 
produce final nickel products this would dramatically increase the CAPEX and operating costs that would 
elevate the glycine t echnology to have the greatest economic benefit as it would be possible to produce 
these final nickel products a lot easier than from flotation concentrates.  
GlyLeachTM also has a further advantage over nickel flotation in cases where arsenic levels are el evated  that 
creat es difficulty in selling the final product.  This is because GlyLeachTM dissolves minimal arsenic into 
solution.  This could be evaluated by further sensitivity analysis.

7.6 MODELLING RECOMMENDATIONS  
The models, developed for hypothetical projects, can be readily adapted to real project comparisons.  It is 
recommended to gradually improve and refine the models with more detailed capital and operating cost 
estimates.  
The evaluations show that there are clear cases where glycine leaching offers substantial advantages over 
the conventional process route.  In particular:  
- Oxide copper resources with acid consumption greater than 25 kg/t;  
- Gold ores with reactive copper levels; and  
- Nickel sulphide ores where flotation performance is relatively poor and/or impurity levels are high.  
However, in all these cases the economics of GlyLeachTM are sensitive to the glycine consumption from 
adsorption.  
 
8 DISCUSSION  
The application of glycine technology for treatment of base metals  and precious metals is new and this study 
has furthered the understanding and highlighted the benefits of the glycine technology for treatment of 
particular ores that suffer from high acid consumption, contain copper or are a waste stream that will not be  
processed through conventional processes.  In the initial fundamental investigation MPS discovered that 
glycine will not be readily consumed biologically under GlyLeachTM or GlyCatTM conditions, is stable in 
solutions at varying pH and concentration or in  the presence of cyanide, ammonia , salt or  copper <0. 5 mg/L.  
A simple titration method could  be used as a practical tool to detect the glycine concentration in solution but 
will need further investigation to overcome over reporting in the presence of ammo nia the main degradation 
product of glycine.  Glycine and metal glycinate complexes will adsorb onto ores, clays and other minerals 
but over 80% of this absorbed glycine can be recovered from the ore.  Using n ano-filtration can recover 75% 
of the glycine  contained  in solution if the sodium concentration of that  solution was below 150 g/ L. 
As part of this investigation seven ore sources were tested four were copper ores, two were gold ores and 
one was a nickel ore.  From the mineralogical information the tes ting confirmed problems with percolation, 
acid consumption and extraction.   The testing supported these predictions and w hile the overall extraction 
results were varied and some would appear to be disappointing  in regards to the 6 m column testing 
performances, overall, it would appear the residue analysis has shown migration of the base metals  from 
coarse to finest fraction.  This would indicate that GlyLeachTM did indeed leach the ore but it reprecipitated 
or w as absorbed onto the finest fraction.  Understanding why this occurs and how to prevent it or alleviate 
it is being studied further  and will be resolved before glycine technology is an option for treatment of base 
metals  via heap leaching .  Why this proble m did not occur during the 1 m column testing is likely the vastly 
different amount of solution that was passed through compared to the 6 m column.  
The gold treatment using GlyCatTM convincingly demonstrated that the technology was directly comparable 
to conventional cyanidation and treatment of ores containing copper .  This will  make glycine technology the 
preferred option to not only recover the precious metals but also the copper.  While the column studies were 
undertaken at 60% of cyanide concentration,  optimisation testing and direct comparison was not undertaken 
to validate the savings.  Residue analysis once again highlight an underlining challenge  of possible adsorption 
issue s where some leached gold and silver reabsorbed onto the leach residue durin g GlyCatTM leaching.  
 
 
 P a g e  | 88 
During the initial small columns study, curing with a number of additives improved the extraction greatly and 
enabled comparable extraction to acid.  While this was not demonstrated at the larger scale economic 
evaluation found that a ddition of these additive s was feasible if there was greater than 12% addition al 
extraction benefit.   This was the case in a number of tests performed.  
Also demonstrated was the treatment of sulfidic copper ore with GlyCatTM where conventional acid 
treatme nt was shown to fail.  While the use of cyanide to dissolve copper i s not conventional the economics 
do show that extraction achieve d justif ies the economic benefit to do so.  
The rate of nickel extraction was shown to be slow for both acid and glycine tech nology.  Increasing  
temperature is well known to increase the rate of extraction . However , the influence of temperature was not 
specifically considered in this work.  The extraction s achieved were borderline  economic al although 
subsequent work has shown co nsiderably more nickel can be recovered in tank s at temperature .  
Overall, this project has demonstrated categorically that the glycine technology is a viable option to treat 
precious metals especially those that contain cyanide consuming species.  De-risking activity showed that 
glycine is both chemically and biologically stable . 
 
9 CONCLUSIONS  
This test work program set out to evaluate glycine technology on the dissolution of base metals (copper and 
nickel) and precious metals (gold and silver) by he ap leaching.  MPS has discovered that glycine will not get 
biologically consumed, is stable in solution and can be recovered by nanofiltration.  It was determined that 
glycine solution would have a  half-life of 150 years due to the combined effects of low copper (herbicide or 
bactericide) and high pH .  The need for oxygen is necessary to improve the dissolution for both base and 
precious metals where intermittent flow aided precious metal recovery.  A simple titration was developed 
for glycine determination  but will still needs some further investigation to eliminate the over detection in the 
presence of ammonia, the main degradation product of glycine.  Glycine and metal glycinate complexes were 
found to adsorb onto all ores , some more than others. I nitial investigation s have shown 80% of the adsorbed 
glycine can be removed with a brine ( salt water) which would be an economical and practical method of 
addressing it .  Further understanding and investigation is underway to address this challenge  to enable 
glycine technology to be applicable for  broad scale  heap leaching of base metals.  GlyCatTM showed that 
similar extraction was achieved in 6 m as to the 1m column proving the technology can extract precious 
metals at much reduced cyanide (60% reduction).  Econ omical modelling shows that the technology would 
be the preferred option for the treatment of high acid (>30 kg/t) consuming ores and gold ores that contain 
any copper in solution.

ABOUT GLYCINE LEACHING TECHNOLOGY  
Glycine Leaching Technology  is an environmentally benign hydrometallurgical technology  that will leach 
copper , nickel,  cobalt and zinc from oxide, mixed oxide and supergene ores , and ev en primary sulphide ores.  
It also can leach precious metals of gold, silver, and PGM’s.  MPS has identified certain additives that act 
synergistically with glycine in an alkaline pH. This is called GlyCatTM. An acidic leach with thiourea as the 
additive has been branded GTTM (Glycine -Thiourea).  
Glycine leaching without additives is more generally called GlyLeachTM. 
ABOUT GLYCINE  
Glycine is the simplest amino acid and is available in bulk  quantities . Its uni que properties can offer 
substantial advantages over conventional  lixiviant s: 
• Environment  / safety: Glycine is non -toxic to humans as well as wildlife.  
• Selectivity: Glycine will solubilise copper , nickel, cobalt and zinc, while iron, manganese, silicates a nd 
carbonates remain in the solid phase.  
• Alkalinity: Leach conditions are at high pH, allowing simple and inexpensive materials of construction.  
• Mild conditions: Leaching is typically at ambient temperature with no heating cost or pressure vessels.  
• Low con sumption: Glycine is non -volatile (unlike cyanide, ammonia, hydrochloric acid) and stable under 
process conditions.  
• Recycle: Glycine is not chemically consumed in the overall process. It is easily recovered and recycled , 
and process losses can be minimised  by good design.  
 
 
 
 
 P a g e  | 105 
ABOUT GLYCATTM 
Small amounts of cyanide used in conjunction with a glycine -dominant lixiviant has many beneficial 
properties, particularly for the leaching of precious metals with elevated copper content. This is a 
consequence of copper  preferentially bonding to glycine rather than cyanide, thus freeing the cyanide to 
leach gold.  Furthermore, the cupric glycinate is an effective oxidant for gold and replaces the need for free 
oxygen in the solution. Benefits include:  
• Lower cost:  
• A small addition of glycine can cause a marked reduction in cyanide consumption.  
• The main glycine reagent is recovered and recycled.  
• Free and WAD cyanide in the leach tails are below the limits for disposal prescribed by the 
International Cyanide Management Code, thus avoiding costly detoxification.  
• Catalysis: Gold extraction can be significantly faster than with cyanide alone.  
• Minimal capital costs to implement.  
• Problematic ores: GlyCatTM enables economical gold extraction from ores with elevated soluble copper.  
Alternative catalysts are available for an entirely cyanide -free process where required.  
 
ABOUT GTTM 
Thiourea in conjunction with a glycine lixiviant has found to be beneficial, for the leaching of precious metals 
and base metals in the aci dic region. Benefits include:  
• No neutralisation costs.  
• Co-extraction: Gold and base metal extraction can be achieved.  
Precious metals still able to still be recovered from with activated carbon.
